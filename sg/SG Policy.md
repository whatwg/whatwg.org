# WHATWG Steering Group Policy

## Purpose of this Policy

This document sets forth the policies that govern the WHATWG [Steering Group], and may be modified by the [Steering Group] from time to time. If the terms of this document conflict with the [Steering Group Agreement], the [Steering Group Agreement] controls.

## Work mode

### Contacting

A. The [Steering Group] must maintain a repository and issue tracker at a well-known location. The current location of the [Steering Group] repository is <https://github.com/whatwg/sg>.

B. Anyone may make requests and queries to the [Steering Group] by filing issues against the [Steering Group] repository. This is the recommended method for contacting the [Steering Group].

C. For private inquiries, the [Steering Group] may be reached by email at <sg@whatwg.org>. Unlike the repository, there is no tracking function for private inquiries.

### Communication

A. Discussion among [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] may take place in issues, by email, or through any other method they agree to.

B. By [consensus], the [Steering Group] may choose to hold phone, in-person, or online meetings. Adequate notice of the time and place should be given. If the [Steering Group] holds meetings, announcements and minutes should be recorded in the issue tracker of the [Steering Group] repository.

### Decisions

A. All [Steering Group] decisions with a visible public effect must be recorded via GitHub issues in the [Steering Group]'s repository.

B. [Steering Group] decisions must be made by [consensus], as defined in the [Steering Group Agreement]. Where the [Steering Group Agreement] requires [unanimous consent], that standard will be used instead.

C. [Consensus] or [unanimous consent] for a decision must be recorded in an issue, either existing or new. It's recommended that each [Steering Group Member] explicitly indicate that they agree, disagree, or abstain.

D. [Consensus] may be assessed outside of the issue tracker, in which case the positions of each [Steering Group Representative] must be recorded in the appropriate issue after the fact.

E. It's recommended for [Steering Group Representatives][Steering Group Representative] to record the rationale for their position in the relevant issue, but not required.

F. This process applies to all matters that call for a [Steering Group] decision.

G. As an exception, [Steering Group] decisions on confidential matters which have strong reason to remain private can be made and recorded privately. The [Steering Group] should use this option sparingly.

### Policies

A. The [Steering Group] may define policies and agreements that govern the operation of the WHATWG. Policies must not conflict with the [Steering Group Agreement]. If they do, the [Steering Group Agreement] takes precedence.

B. Other than the [Steering Group Agreement] and the [WHATWG Principles], the [Steering Group] may adopt, amend, or revoke Policies or Agreements by [consensus]. The same applies to this Steering Group Policy.

C. The canonical copies of all WHATWG policies and agreements must be kept in the [Steering Group]'s repository. Policies may also be published elsewhere, such as on <https://whatwg.org/>.

D. Changes to policies and agreements should be made by pull request associated with an issue. Changes must be reviewed by a [Steering Group Representative] and may only be merged by [Consensus] or [unanimous consent] of the [Steering Group], as set forth in the [Steering Group Agreement].

E. Anyone may propose policy changes via issue and pull request. The [Steering Group] is not obliged to respond to such proposals.

## Powers and responsibilities

### General

A. When this or any other WHATWG policy or agreement says the [Steering Group] may or must decide something or take an action, the decision must be made following the process defined in this [Steering Group Policy].

B. The [Steering Group] has no obligation to respond to requests in any particular time frame, except where this or any other policy requires it.

C. Other WHATWG policies may state additional requirements for [Steering Group] decisions on particular matters. The [Steering Group] must follow any such requirements.

D. In addition to the actions and decisions explicitly listed in this policy, the [Steering Group] may take any other action regarding the WHATWG that is consistent with the [Steering Group Agreement].

### Workstreams

B. The [Steering Group] may create, modify, split, or terminate [Workstreams][Workstream].

C. The [Steering Group] must maintain an [up-to-date list] of active [Workstreams][Workstream] in the [Steering Group]'s repository.

D. For each [Workstream], the list must include the [Workstream]'s name, scope, [editor], and [Living Standards][Living Standard], and for each [Living Standard] the name, URL and repository URL. The [Steering Group] must update this information when changed by the [Steering Group] or an [editor].

### Editors

A. Each [Workstreams][Workstream] is led by an [editor] appointed by the [Steering Group].

B. The [Steering Group] must appoint an [editor] when creating a new [Workstream].

C. The [Steering Group] should appoint a new [editor] in a reasonable time period in case of vacancy.

D. The [Steering Group] may remove [editors][editor].

E. The [Steering Group] may overrule any decision made by an [editor].

B. How [Workstream participants] join or leave [Workstreams][Workstream] will be defined by other WHATWG policies.

C. The [Steering Group] may remove participants from [Workstreams][Workstream].

### Appeals

A. [Workstream participants] may appeal decisions by an [editor]. They must do so in accordance with other applicable policies.

B. The [Steering Group] must decide on all such appeals, if not withdrawn. The [Steering Group] may request additional information, or attempt to resolve disagreement amicably.
