# WHATWG Steering Group Agreement

## 1. Parties

This [Agreement] is made commencing 2017-11-30 by and among the parties identified below regarding
participation in and governance of the WHATWG. Each party to this [Agreement] is a
"<a id="steering-group-member">**Steering Group Member**</a>"; collectively, the [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] constitute the "[Steering Group]" of
the WHATWG. Each [Steering Group Member] and its Affiliates are deemed a single entity under this
[Agreement] (e.g., for purposes of membership, participation, voting, and intellectual property
commitments).

## 2. Purpose of the Steering Group

The purpose of the [Steering Group] is to govern and guide the WHATWG, an open, efficient forum for
development of [Living Standards] (useful technical specifications, with intellectual property
commitments from contributors) plus associated documentation, code, and other
materials and activities that relate to or support web technologies, as determined by the Steering
Group.

## 3. Roles and participation

### 3.1. Qualifications and composition

#### A. Composition

The [Steering Group] is comprised of [Qualifying Entities][Qualifying Entity].

#### B. Initial members

The initial [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] are the four [Qualifying Entities][Qualifying Entity] identified below: Mozilla
Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Google LLC, and Apple Inc. Other [Qualifying Entities][Qualifying Entity] may be
added by [unanimous consent] of the then-current [Steering Group].

#### C. Number of members

The [Steering Group] must have at least three and no more than seven members (except for the
temporary two-member status provided for in Section 6.4).

#### D. Representatives

Each [Steering Group Member] appoints an individual "<a id="steering-group-representative">**Steering Group Representative**</a>" to represent
its interests, cast votes, and otherwise represent the interests of the [Steering Group Member]. A
[Steering Group Member] may replace its [Steering Group Representative] at any time in its sole
discretion.

### 3.2. Functions

#### A. Mission

The mission of the [Steering Group] is to help facilitate cross-engine interoperability by adoption
and implementation of the WHATWG [Living Standards] in the leading integrated web platform engines.

#### B. Scope and responsibilities

The [Steering Group] has final say in all matters regarding the WHATWG; among other
responsibilities, it sets direction; provides governance; and helps to promote consistency and
efficiency, and prevent fragmentation.

### 3.3. Decisions

#### A. Decisions requiring unanimous consent

By <a id="unanimous-consent">**unanimous consent**</a>, the [Steering Group] may:

1. Modify the [WHATWG Principles].

2. Modify the WHATWG legal structure.

3. Approve the initial version of the [Intellectual Property Rights Policy].

4. Add a [Steering Group Member].

5. Remove a [Steering Group Member] \(where the [Steering Group Member] at issue is not counted for
  purposes of determining unanimity).

6. Amend this [Agreement].

#### B. Other decisions by Consensus

By [Consensus], the [Steering Group] may take any other action regarding the WHATWG, including but
not limited to creating, implementing, and modifying policies and agreements of the WHATWG
and of the [Steering Group]. Such policies and agreements must not alter or overrule the terms
of the [Steering Group Agreement][Agreement].

### 3.4. Responsibilities, clarifications, and limitations

#### A. No fiduciary duties

The [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] seek to further the work of the WHATWG,
consistent with its [principles][WHATWG Principles], but neither the [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] nor their [Representatives][Steering Group Representative]
owe any fiduciary duty to any other [Steering Group Member] or to any participant in or contributor
to the WHATWG.

#### B. Liability exclusions and limitations

Except to the extent limited by law (*e.g.,* for
willful misconduct), neither the [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] nor their [Representatives][Steering Group Representative], employees,
contractors, or agents are liable to any other party for any act or omission related to the WHATWG,
nor are they responsible for any activities of the [Steering Group] or the WHATWG. In the
event the preceding contractual exclusions from liability are not enforceable, the maximum
liability of any party to any other party is USD$100.

## 4. Antitrust

### 4.1. Antitrust

The WHATWG is a forum for voluntary development and promotion of
standards, specifications, technical requirements, code, best practices, and documentation for
the web. No applicant for participation in the WHATWG will be rejected for any anticompetitive
purpose, and its participants are free to join and participate freely in competing
organizations and to develop and market competing technologies, products, and services. Each
participant in the WHATWG is responsible for its compliance with all applicable laws, including
antitrust and competition laws and regulations, and must rely on independent legal counsel
(and not this [Agreement] or any policy of the WHATWG) regarding compliance.
While participating in WHATWG activities, WHATWG participants should not discuss any competitively sensitive, strategic commercial information in a way that would be contrary to applicable competition laws. For example, such information may include confidential, competitively sensitive information about business strategies, plans, or data regarding sales, pricing, market share, marketing plans, business plans, and strategic initiatives.

### 4.2. Steering Group antitrust

Applicants for [Steering Group] membership must meet the criteria of
a [Qualifying Entity] as defined below, and such qualification will be determined by unanimous vote of all
then-current [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member]. No qualified applicant for [Steering Group] membership will
be rejected for any anticompetitive purpose.

## 5. Definitions

1. "Affiliate" means any legal entity that directly or indirectly [Controls](#control), is [Controlled](#control) by, or
is under common [Control](#control) with an entity. "<a id="control">**Control**</a>" means the power to determine the course of
action of another entity (for example by ownership of more than 50% of the voting stock or
equity, authority to appoint a majority of the board or equivalent body, or by virtue of its
voting or other rights).

2. "<a id="consensus">**Consensus**</a>" means the parties concur. [Consensus] may be established tacitly. By way of example,
so long as (1) proposed actions are clear and visible, (2) participants have opportunities to
voice concerns, and (3) there is no sustained, substantive opposition, then [Consensus] may be
established simply by moving forward on the proposal or a course of action; this is anticipated
to be the norm for most matters. Upon request by a [Steering Group Member] (or upon appeal by a
party authorized by a WHATWG policy to do so), however, a vote must be taken, in which case an
affirmative vote of a [Supermajority] of [Qualified Voting Parties](#qualified-voting-party) establishes [Consensus].

3. "<a id="qualifying-entity">**Qualifying Entity**</a>" means an entity that develops one of the core end-to-end integrated web
browser platform engines and distributes its integrated implementations widely.

4. "<a id="qualified-voting-party">**Qualified Voting Party**</a>" means each party entitled to vote on a given matter.

5. "<a id="steering-group">**Steering Group**</a>" means all [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member].

6. "<a id="supermajority">**Supermajority**</a>" means 2/3 or more.

## 6. Term and termination

### 6.1. Effective dates

The [Agreement] will become effective initially as of the date set forth above when executed by all four
[Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member], and will become effective as to each subsequently approved [Steering Group Member]
as of the date the [Agreement] is executed and delivered to the other [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member].

### 6.2. Termination of Steering Group Member

Any [Steering Group Member] may terminate its
participation in the [Agreement] by delivering written notice to the [Steering Group].

### 6.3. Effect of withdrawal or termination

No new obligations are incurred by a [Steering Group Member]
after its withdrawal or termination, but obligations already incurred do not terminate.

### 6.4. Termination of Agreement

This [Agreement] continues until terminated by [Consensus] of the
[Steering Group]; if, however, there are fewer than three [Steering Group Members][Steering Group Member] for 70
consecutive days, this [Agreement] terminates automatically. (For the avoidance of doubt: If the
[Steering Group] were to terminate this [Agreement], development of the WHATWG [Living Standards]
could continue under some other structure, or no structure.)

## 7. Execution
