# WHATWG Principles

The WHATWG is an open, efficient forum for development of useful, interoperable [Living Standards] that will be used on the web, plus documentation and code that relate to or support web technologies; it is responsive to the interests of implementers and users, guided by a core group of leading developers and implementers of integrated browser engines, and secures appropriate intellectual property commitments from contributors.

## Openness

The WHATWG is founded on an open agreement and is open to suggestions from all; [Living Standards] are informed by input from contributors, driven by workstream participants, articulated by editors, and guided by the [Steering Group].

## Utility

Utility for end users and implementers is at the core of standards development in the WHATWG, with a focus on the features and functions that are most likely to be enabled in the leading integrated browser engines.

## Efficiency

Editors modify the [Living Standards] based on available information and community positions, working to bridge differences and move forward efficiently; the [Steering Group] provides direction and, when substantive technical objections are raised or matters are not resolved within the [Workstream], makes consensus-based decisions consistent with these principles.

## Freedom

[Workstream Participants] and contributors make well-scoped licensing commitments to promote royalty-free licensing for [Living Standards].
