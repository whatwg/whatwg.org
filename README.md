This repository hosts [whatwg.org](https://whatwg.org/) and some related sites. Feel free to help improve them!

### Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. Please read and respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://whatwg.org/code-of-conduct).

### Location of files

Several pages present on https://whatwg.org/ are generated or copied from the [whatwg/sg](https://github.com/whatwg/sg) repository. This happens in the `deploy.sh` script.

So if you're confused as to why the `whatwg.org` directory doesn't have everything you see on the site, that's probably why.
