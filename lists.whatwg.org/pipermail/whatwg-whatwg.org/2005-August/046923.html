&lt;cite&gt; is good for citing another work.

I can come up with several. Although you may think it unlikely now, you 
may like to change the styling of your cited works at some point in the 
future.

You may also like to loop through &lt;cite&gt; elements in JavaScript and link 
them to an external database of works, or generate a reference list. 
These are just examples of the huge advantages of using meaningful 
semantic elements instead of presentational elements.

The fact that your preferred editor does not offer a predefined keyboard 
shortcut for using proper semantic elements is not an excuse.
