And, as I demonstrated in an earlier e-mail with the widgEditor I linked 
to, it's not hard for an author to provide a script that converts the 
textarea to a WYSIWYG editor using the contentEditable DOM interface. 
It's not much different from the scripts that are being written to add 
support for other extensions in today's browsers.

</I>
That's a reasonable argument for standardising the DOM interface for it, 
but not for including contentEditable as an attribute in the markup, 
which is what I'm against the most.

Although I am against the use of contentEditable in general, that's 
mostly because {a) all the implementations of it are broken and (b) the 
way it was designed is too presentationally oriented for a semantic 
markup language - it basically suffers from the same design flaws as 
every other WYSIWYG editor.

Using the wiki example, a script could be provided which captures the 
events for the &quot;edit this&quot; links and dynamically makes the content for 
that section editable using the contentEditable DOM interface.  Scripts 
would also be used to handle the submission.

However, without script those links should fall back to the way they 
currently work, which is to load a seperate page with the editable 
markup in a textarea for the user.  Additionally, that textarea could 
have an accept=&quot;text/html&quot; attribute, from which (even without JS 
enabled) the user agent could choose to load an HTML editor for the user 
(whether that be for just providing syntax highlighting in code view or 
a WYSIWYG style editor).

Personally, I'd like to see it better integrated with the DOM 2 Range 
interface, so the scripts could work with the nodes a little easier and 
which I'd like to see more widely implemented.
