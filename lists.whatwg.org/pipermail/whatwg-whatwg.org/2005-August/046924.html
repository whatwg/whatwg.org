In theory, screen-readers could intone &lt;cite&gt; elements differently from 
&lt;i&gt; elements, to avoid confusion (when reading articles about movies, 
for example). In English, for example, &lt;cite&gt; would be slightly lower 
pitch, at slightly slower speed, and with less tonal variation, while 
&lt;em&gt; would be slightly higher pitch at slightly slower speed with 
normal tonal variation, and &lt;i&gt; would be no change from normal.

In practice, current popular screen-readers piggyback on Internet 
Explorer for Windows, and therefore make no distinction between the 
various italic elements whatsoever.

&gt;<i> ...

</I>&gt;<i> strike-through fuchsia) seemed ludicrous.
</I>
I have seen some sites that style &lt;cite&gt; differently from &lt;i&gt;, usually 
as italics + some color. They could do that just as easily with &lt;i 
class=&quot;title&quot;&gt; (even overriding the italics later if they wanted, while 
retaining them for CSS-ignoring UAs).

&gt;<i> Also, the point about pieces of software doing something cool with the 
</I>&gt;<i> data did not seem like a truthful explanation, because &lt;cite&gt; has been 
</I>&gt;<i> around for a long time and still there are no reports of a killer app 
</I>&gt;<i> emerging around it. So I did not recommend &lt;cite&gt;.
</I>
Right. The other use of &lt;cite&gt; I can think of (as I mentioned in the 
article you cited) would be for a site like Technorati to extract the 
titles of books or movies people were talking about. But I haven't seen 
any site that does that yet.

&gt;<i> Aside: Now that I looked at the source of the literature list, I 
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that some titles of works were marked up as &lt;em&gt;. my 
</I>&gt;<i> hypothesis is that after an upgrade Dreamweaver has started using &lt;em&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> when pressing command-i. Sigh. See 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2004/05/02/b-and-i">http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2004/05/02/b-and-i</A>

It's ironic that semantic markup advocacy is gradually preventing &lt;em&gt; 
from ever being semantically useful (hence my article). Since there are 
currently no popular clients that usefully distinguish &lt;em&gt; from the 
other italic elements, there's no obvious way of demonstrating authors' 
wrongness when they use &lt;em&gt; but really mean &lt;cite&gt;/&lt;var&gt;/&lt;dfn&gt;/&lt;i&gt;, so 
no future client will be able to trust that an &lt;em&gt; in a page means 
what the HTML spec says it does. &lt;em&gt; will be the new &lt;i&gt;.

&lt;cite&gt; is probably safe for now, but only because &lt;em&gt; is the honeypot 
for those who are replacing all their occurrences of &lt;i&gt; with one other 
element.

And &lt;i&gt; itself was presentational from its inception, which is one of 
the reasons HTML 5's redefinition of &lt;i&gt; as semantic is misguided. No 
client will ever be able to treat &lt;i&gt; as &quot;an instance of the use of a 
term&quot; on the public Web, because pages that use it for some purpose 
other than &quot;an instance of the use of a term&quot; number at least in the 
hundreds of millions. Even if semantic clients used doctype-sniffing to 
special-case HTML 5, Web browsers would not, so authors would still use 
&lt;i&gt; for italics by mistake far too often.

The problem applies to block elements just as much as inline ones. For 
example, the current HTML 5 draft effectively redefines &lt;dl&gt;/&lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; 
as presentational elements (though HTML 4 opened the stable door, both 
by suggesting them for &quot;marking up dialogues&quot;, and by using them for 
non-definition purposes on the very first page of the spec itself). 
Something like Google Glossary could extract &lt;dl&gt;/&lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; if it was 
unambiguously for definitions, but what can software do with HTML 5's 
&quot;any ... groups of name-value data&quot;? Nothing at all. It's semantically 
useless, and therefore presentational.

One useful line of retreat would be to specify that in the following 
code, &quot;the state of being happy&quot; is unambiguously a definition of 
&quot;happiness&quot; and not of any other subset of the &lt;dt&gt;.

     &lt;dl&gt;
       &lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;happiness&lt;/dfn&gt; /'h&#230; p&#618; nes/ &lt;i&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;n.&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
       &lt;dd&gt;the state of being happy&lt;/dd&gt;
     &lt;/dl&gt;

This could be encouraged by &quot;dt dfn {font-weight: bold; font-style: 
normal;}&quot; in browsers' default style sheets, which would be quite 
backward-compatible because of the rarity of &lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn&gt; up to now.
