</I>
   Yeah, after looking at the section in question, it's of limited use
if it can't define how HTML interacts with CSS3-UI specifically...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> Matches form control elements that have the readonly attribute set,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> and to which the readonly attribute applies (thus radio buttons will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> never match this, regardless of the value of the attribute), as well
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> as other elements defined by this specification that are defined as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> read-only under the CSS3 Basic User Interface Module.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Actually, looking at the first part (which is pretty much identical to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>what you have), it's in conflict with CSS3-UI, because &lt;input 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>type=&quot;radio&quot; disabled&gt; technically matches the CSS3-UI definition 
</I>&gt;&gt;:<i>read-only selector.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I discussed this with some CSSWG members, and our conclusion was that 
</I>&gt;<i> :read-only and :disabled being orthogonal was the most useful, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> why I wrote the WF2 spec the way I did.
</I>
   I'll bring that up in www-style as a reason to change the spec, then. ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>The whole point of the section is to say which elements defined by WF2 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>match the definition of CSS3 UI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>CSS3-UI is quite clear about that. Anything, and I mean ANYTHING, that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is not &quot;user-alterable&quot; is :read-only under CSS3-UI. Even disabled 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;input&gt; controls are user-alterable. That's why any implication that a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>disabled radio button is not :read-only would be a contradiction of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>CSS3-UI specification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since that was apparently not the intent of the specification, it isn't as 
</I>&gt;<i> clear as we might have hoped! :-) Hence the much more specific definitions 
</I>&gt;<i> here. (What does &quot;user alterable&quot; mean? With the Mozilla DOM Inspector I 
</I>&gt;<i> can &quot;alter&quot; anything in any DOM.)
</I>
   Well, what's worse is that &quot;user alterable&quot; is a subset of the
definition of &quot;read-only&quot; as it is defined in HTML 4.01. A read-only
element in HTML is submittable and focusable unless it is also disabled.
The :read-only pseudo-class as defined in CSS3-UI, which is defined in
terms of user alterability, would include content that is not
submittable, and therefore apply to elements not considered read-only in
HTML 4.01.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>One possibility would be viewing a database view where the user has 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>rights to edit a field on some records but not others (e.g. allowed to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>edit the customer's start date but only if the customer hasn't started 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>yet). As you flip through records, the field becomes read-only or not. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>It's not disabled, because the data is still relevant, even though it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>can't be edited. (Indeed in XForms &quot;enabled&quot; is spelt &quot;relevant&quot;, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>IIRC.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Are you suggesting we expand &lt;fieldset&gt; to include |disabled| and
</I>&gt;&gt;|<i>readonly| properties that are inherited by child controls?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Disabled is already done. &quot;readonly&quot; I'm less sure about, but I have added 
</I>&gt;<i> it to the list of things to consider for WF3.
</I>
   It's possible that a group of fields could be read-only, especially
if you don't have security access to change them, so this does need to
be considered. Very true.

&gt;&gt;<i>That may not be such a bad idea. (BTW, I've already reconsidered my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>position on whether |disabled| and |readonly| are mutually exclusive. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>They are not.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think they are. :-) If they were not, why would they be independent 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes? Even in XForms the two concepts are separated.
</I>
   I think you're confusing &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; with &quot;orthogonal&quot;.
