   Clarification: I meant that the author of CSS3-UI would obviously
approve of language in WF2 that reinforces CSS3-UI, since he wrote the
section that the material reinforces.

&gt;<i> CSS isn't being disputed here (or if it is, it's the wrong mailing list).
</I>
   No, at this point it's being disputed in www-style. I've made
extensive and detailed arguments there.

&gt;<i> And the editor of the CSS3 UI spec didn't write the disputed part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> WF2 spec; I wrote the latter.
</I>
   Which is why I want you to change it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>If the disputed section is the one I wrote (i.e. the one quoted above) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>then no, he didn't; I wrote it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I never said he wrote it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You said &quot;Of course he gave it the all clear. He's the one who wrote the 
</I>&gt;<i> disputed portion of the spec in the first place.&quot; -- if you didn't mean 
</I>&gt;<i> that then I've no idea what you meant, sorry.
</I>
   See the above clarification.

&gt;&gt;<i>You altered WF2 to make it repeat aspects of what he wrote (CSS3-UI). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Obviously the person who wrote the sections of the CSS3-UI spec you're 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>drawing from is going to agree with corrections that reinforce his own 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I'm glad you agree that it reinforces CSS3 UI and doesn't conflict 
</I>&gt;<i> with it. That is what was intended. We can't really do anything else, 
</I>&gt;<i> since CSS3 UI isn't one of the specs WHATWG is doing.
</I>
   Sure you can. You can change the language is a way that doesn't make
WF2 depend so completely on a portion of the specification that it
clearly in dispute.

&gt;&gt;<i>What was wrong with the revision I suggested?...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;|<i> Matches form control elements that have the readonly attribute set,
</I>&gt;&gt;|<i> and to which the readonly attribute applies (thus radio buttons will
</I>&gt;&gt;|<i> never match this, regardless of the value of the attribute), as well
</I>&gt;&gt;|<i> as other elements defined by this specification that are defined as
</I>&gt;&gt;|<i> read-only under the CSS3 Basic User Interface Module.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the second part doesn't say anything (it's redundant with CSS3 UI). 
</I>
   Actually, looking at the first part (which is pretty much identical
to what you have), it's in conflict with CSS3-UI, because &lt;input
type=&quot;radio&quot; disabled&gt; technically matches the CSS3-UI definition
:<i>read-only selector.
</I>
   So, even if we specificly endorse :read-only and :read-write as they
are defined in CSS3-UI, the text should read as follows:

|<i> :read-only
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>    Matches form control elements that have the readonly or disabled
</I>|<i>    attributes set, and to which the readonly attribute applies (thus
</I>|<i>    enabled radio buttons will never match this, regardless of the
</I>|<i>    value of the attribute), as well as elements defined by this
</I>|<i>    specification that are not form controls (namely form, label,
</I>|<i>    datalist, option, optgroup, and fieldset elements).
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> :read-write
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>    Matches form control elements that do not have the readonly or
</I>|<i>    disabled attributes set (including password fields, although
</I>|<i>    technically they should be called &quot;writeonly&quot;).
</I>
   The section that currently says the following...

|<i> A disabled field can still match this pseudo-class; the states are
</I>|<i> orthogonal.
</I>
   ...is wrong. Anything that is not &quot;user-alterable&quot; under CSS3-UI is
read-only.

   With regard to the entire section, note that :enabled, :disabled,
:<i>checked and :indeterminate are defined by CSS3 Selectors, not CSS3-UI.
</I>The latter spec only defines some details of the :active pseudo-class.
(Then again, you should know that, because your name is on the CSS3
Selectors spec.)

   As to a certain level of redundancy, I don't see how that can be
avoided. CSS3-UI is clear in its meaning, in both its existing for and
with my proposed changes on www-style.

   If my proposed changes to CSS3-UI are accepted, though, I suggest the
following changes to the WF2 spec:

|<i> :read-only
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>    Matches elements that have the readonly attribute set.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> :read-write
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>    Matches elements that do not have the readonly attribute set, but
</I>|<i>    support the readonly attribute.
</I>

&gt;<i> The whole point of the section is to say which elements defined by WF2 
</I>&gt;<i> match the definition of CSS3 UI.
</I>
   CSS3-UI is quite clear about that. Anything, and I mean ANYTHING,
that is not &quot;user-alterable&quot; is :read-only under CSS3-UI. Even disabled
&lt;input&gt; controls are user-alterable. That's why any implication that a
disabled radio button is not :read-only would be a contradiction of the
CSS3-UI specification.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>In a scenario with script, when would you disable the &lt;input readonly&gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>element specifically and in markup rather than disabling a parent 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;fieldset&gt;?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>There might not be a parent &lt;fieldset&gt;. In any case, what's the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>difference?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So, when am I going to need to disable a single read-only control 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>independently of other controls? Not seeing a use case here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One possibility would be viewing a database view where the user has rights 
</I>&gt;<i> to edit a field on some records but not others (e.g. allowed to edit the 
</I>&gt;<i> customer's start date but only if the customer hasn't started yet). As you 
</I>&gt;<i> flip through records, the field becomes read-only or not. It's not 
</I>&gt;<i> disabled, because the data is still relevant, even though it can't be 
</I>&gt;<i> edited. (Indeed in XForms &quot;enabled&quot; is spelt &quot;relevant&quot;, IIRC.)
</I>
   Are you suggesting we expand &lt;fieldset&gt; to include |disabled| and
|<i>readonly| properties that are inherited by child controls? That may not
</I>be such a bad idea. (BTW, I've already reconsidered my position on
whether |disabled| and |readonly| are mutually exclusive. They are not.)
