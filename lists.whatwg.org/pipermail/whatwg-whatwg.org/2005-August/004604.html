Indeed. contentEditable is a core platform feature, as someone pointed 
out, rather than a final widget.

Similarly, ondragstart and co are platform components, not final widgets. 
You can't do anything with ondragstart on its own, especially without 
scripting. But it is still important.


&gt;<i> That's a reasonable argument for standardising the DOM interface for it, 
</I>&gt;<i> but not for including contentEditable as an attribute in the markup, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is what I'm against the most.
</I>
Having the content attribute is important for describing the initial state 
and for being able ot serialise the current state on the fly.


&gt;<i> Although I am against the use of contentEditable in general, that's 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly because {a) all the implementations of it are broken
</I>
All the implementations of CSS and HTML and the DOM are broken too, I 
don't suggest we remove those! :-)


&gt;<i> and (b) the way it was designed is too presentationally oriented for a 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic markup language - it basically suffers from the same design 
</I>&gt;<i> flaws as every other WYSIWYG editor.
</I>
Could you elaborate? It would be nice to fix these.


&gt;<i> Using the wiki example, a script could be provided which captures the 
</I>&gt;<i> events for the &quot;edit this&quot; links and dynamically makes the content for 
</I>&gt;<i> that section editable using the contentEditable DOM interface.  Scripts 
</I>&gt;<i> would also be used to handle the submission.
</I>
Yup.


&gt;<i> However, without script those links should fall back to the way they 
</I>&gt;<i> currently work, which is to load a seperate page with the editable 
</I>&gt;<i> markup in a textarea for the user.
</I>
Yup.


&gt;<i> Additionally, that textarea could have an accept=&quot;text/html&quot; attribute, 
</I>&gt;<i> from which (even without JS enabled) the user agent could choose to load 
</I>&gt;<i> an HTML editor for the user (whether that be for just providing syntax 
</I>&gt;<i> highlighting in code view or a WYSIWYG style editor).
</I>
Yup.


&gt;<i> Personally, I'd like to see it better integrated with the DOM 2 Range 
</I>&gt;<i> interface, so the scripts could work with the nodes a little easier and 
</I>&gt;<i> which I'd like to see more widely implemented.
</I>
Could you elaborate?
