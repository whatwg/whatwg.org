<PRE>   Note: In the context of this email, I'm using the theoretical
attribute |usehtml| as a trigger for converting a standard text-based
&lt;textarea&gt; to one that supports HTML content.

   How is this any different from an HTML-enabled &lt;textarea&gt;? You can
toggle editing with |readonly|, and the document's CSS file would
provide styling unless you override it using |style|. The only place the
structure is not maintained is within the &lt;textarea&gt; itself, and you
want to edit that anyway.

&gt;<i> This is really useful for CMS'es 
</I>&gt;<i> and other kind of editors - template editing and so on.
</I>
   Not too familiar with CMSes. Can you give a short use case. It would
be very helpful.

&gt;<i> contentEditable is quite clean since you just toggle an attribute.
</I>
|<i> &lt;textarea usehtml readonly&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Contents...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
</I>
   Just toggle |readonly|...

&gt;<i> With 
</I>&gt;<i> your proposal, the editable element should toggle between the original 
</I>&gt;<i> content, and a textarea element containing content, now HTML escaped, 
</I>&gt;<i> but still rendered as if it were ordinary content, including inheriting 
</I>&gt;<i> styles and so on from the containing document. That does not seem very 
</I>&gt;<i> clean.
</I>
   First of all, the escaping, while perhaps necessary for having your
code validate, is not necessary from a practical fallback point of view.
Most browsers treat HTML tags withing a &lt;textarea&gt; as if they were text.
So, we simply define &lt;textarea&gt; for text as containing text, &lt;textarea
usehtml&gt; as containing HTML, and the fallback for &lt;textarea usehtml&gt;,
realistically, is already handled.

   Obviously, an ordinary &lt;textarea&gt; can style HTML contents in a legacy
browser, but that's far better than using |contenteditable|, which has
no fallback at all. With |contenteditable| in Firefox, for instance, you
get static elements.

&gt;&gt;<i>User can edit with plain text editor or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>UA can load WYSIWYG editor for text/html (or whatever ever MIME type is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>specified)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this considers the editable content as just an arbitrary content 
</I>&gt;<i> type which should be edited in some external editor.
</I>
   Well, the editor doesn't really have to be external. In fact, the
whole thing can be implemented in a way similar to |contenteditable|
from a UI standpoint.

&gt;<i> The point of 
</I>&gt;<i> contentEditable is that the editable content is HTML and an integrated 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the containing page, which enables much cleaner &quot;in place&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> editing. If you just consider the editable content an arbitrary blob of 
</I>&gt;<i> editable content, you wouldn't e.g. expect styles from the containing 
</I>&gt;<i> document to inherit into the editable HTML, which is a major point of 
</I>&gt;<i> contentEditable.
</I>
   What are you talking about? Why wouldn't a UA use the styling of the
parent document to style the HTML inside a &lt;textarea usehtml&gt; element?
It's not like it's a &lt;frame&gt; or an &lt;object&gt;, after all. It's internal to
the document.

&gt;<i> Also consider that editable areas may contain non-editable islands which 
</I>&gt;<i> aganin may contain editable areas. How would that be expresses using 
</I>&gt;<i> TEXTAREA ?
</I>
   Is that even handled by |contenteditable| in its current incarnation?
For that matter, it doesn't make a lot of sense from a UI standpoint.
When was the last time you edited something and were not able to delete
a specific section because it was non-editable? People wouldn't even
understand why it wasn't editable. They'd just flood webmasters with
emails about how they couldn't delete a certain section. If you must
have static content between two editable areas, why not just have
multiple editing elements:

|<i> &lt;textarea usehtml&gt;Editable content&lt;/textarea&gt;
</I>|<i> &lt;p&gt;Static content&lt;/p&gt;
</I>|<i> &lt;textarea usehtml&gt;Editable content&lt;/textarea&gt;
</I>
   I'm just not seeing the use case here.

   ...Wait. That said, what about this:

|<i> &lt;textarea usehtml name=&quot;editme&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;p&gt;Editable content&lt;/p&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;textarea readonly&gt;Static content&lt;/textarea&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;p&gt;Editable content&lt;/p&gt;
</I>|<i> &lt;/textarea&gt;
</I>
   Hmm.

   /me shrugs.

   I don't know. Not sure I like it.

&gt;&gt;<i>That would be a far better option than using contentEditable, which is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>not only conceptually broken, but *all* implementations of it are so 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>incredibly broken, that trying to standardise it is like dragging a dead 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>horse through mud.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly the IE implementation (which is the only non-beta 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation i know of) has its issues, but I dont see how its 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;conceptually broken&quot;. Its very useful, despite its shortcomings.
</I>
   Here's how it's conceptually broken: How do you submit the edited
content without scripting? How do you edit the content in a legacy
browser? How do you style the read-only or read-write contents with out
using those G*d-awful versions of the :read-only and :read-write
pseudo-classes from CSS3-UI? Why are we allowing editing outside a form
or controls context?
