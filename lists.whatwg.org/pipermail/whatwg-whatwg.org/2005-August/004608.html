   Yeah, that was already my conclusion, as I hinted to later in the
message.

&gt;&gt;<i>After all, if we're going to be dynamically inserting and removing

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;textarea accept=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we already have &lt;textarea accept&gt;. It's up to you guys to convince 
</I>&gt;<i> UA makers to implement it. :-)
</I>
   I think there are still issues to address with regards to &lt;textarea
accept&gt;. For example, are the HTML contents loaded into the DOM? Are
they treated like a separate document in an &lt;iframe&gt;, or are they more
like the contents of &lt;div contenteditable&gt;? Do they inherit their styles
from the current web page? I think all of this needs to be properly
defined, or |contenteditable| will win simply by virtue of inconsistent
implementation of &lt;textarea accept&gt;.

&gt;<i> It's worth bearing in mind that Microsoft originally had &lt;htmlarea&gt; and 
</I>&gt;<i> dropped it competely in favour of contentEditable before shipping.
</I>
   I'm on the fence as to whether we need an outright &lt;htmlarea&gt;
element, or if we can just style &lt;textarea&gt;. This seems to tie into the
current discussion about styling controls on www-style. If people can be
reasonably certain that they can style &lt;textarea accept&gt; like a &lt;div&gt; or
a &lt;span&gt;, we won't need &lt;htmlarea&gt;.

&gt;&gt;<i>Hmm. IE supports the .contentEditable property, so why not just drop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the HTML attribute |contenteditable| and leave the DOM property?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having content attributes is good for serialising DOM states. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the &quot;value&quot; DOM attribute on controls is not the same as the 
</I>&gt;<i> content attribute has caused many problems and makes it impossible to 
</I>&gt;<i> store the state of a modified form in a serialised format.
</I>
   I don't really see a use case, but then at this point I'm willing to
let it slide if &lt;textarea accept&gt; is better defined for &quot;text/html&quot;.

   Here's an example of how poorly &lt;textarea accept=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt; is
defined. When you press a reset button, the form controls return to
their defaults. So, if you press reset on a page with &lt;textarea
accept=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt;, it should restore the default contents of the
&lt;textarea&gt;. This means the child text of &lt;textarea&gt; must be maintained
or you can't do a reset for that control. So, where are the modified
HTML contents of the control when it's being edited? In the DOM? They
can't be children of &lt;textarea&gt; because it already contains the contents
it needs for the reset.

   This would suggest that &lt;textarea&gt; HTML contents need to be in a
separate document object. If that's the case, how is styling handled?
Does it inherit from the parent document? What would a selector like
&quot;textarea &gt; p&quot; do?

   I suppose we could just make it to where &lt;textarea&gt; only parses the
first child node for resets, and only if it's a text node. Every other
child would be the current contents of the control. However, I think
that content would have to be dumped if you save the page to disk. Is
that any different from what we do with the contents of &lt;input&gt;, though?
