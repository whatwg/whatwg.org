   I don't think it's wise to dictate what markup the user agent
supports via a toolbar or the like for HTML editing in a page. That's
crossing over from semantic to behavioral. If your really want to
specify that, it should be done via a DOM interface.

   By the way, I think Hallvord's asking for giving the UA vendors
flexibility in what tools are available for HTML editing in a document,
not asking for anything to be mandatory. Vendors are likely to implement
what they feel is useful for the users anyway.

&gt;&gt;<i>My question is whether we could make contentEditable more useful for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>HTML/CMS authors by removing scripting requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be extremely unhappy, and would need to find ways of blocking

</I>&gt;<i> letting any user/browsers attempts at html into the CMS would be
</I>&gt;<i> worse.
</I>
   Servers must validate all input, regardless of whether or not it came
from a form control. That's always been the case. With something like
|<i>contenteditable|, which need not even be submitted, hiding client-side
</I>validation requirements deep in a WHAT WG spec isn't in the interests of
developers and will likely be ignored.

&gt;<i> So whilst I agree with the need, please seperate the browser provided
</I>&gt;<i> from the script provided interfaces.
</I>
   It would be nice to be able to explicitly define what markup can be
used in a |contenteditable| element. Any suggestions how that can be
defined?
