Maybe that's the fundamental problem. &lt;cite&gt; (and others) are useless 
because they don't _do_ anything. If &lt;cite&gt; was like the LaTeX \cite{} + 
BibTeX (e.g. [1]) and could be used to automatically insert references 
from an external list and create a reference list with a &lt;bibliography 
/&gt; tag then it would be widely used, at least in the subset of documents 
where that functionality is desirable. But instead there isn't a clear 
design goal other than &quot;citations should be recognisable as such&quot; which 
isn't a strong enough reason to use it and (apparently) hasn't allowed 
for enough functionality that UA vendors have been able to hook up 
unexpected functions that make using &lt;cite&gt; desirable.

This isn't a suggestion to make &lt;cite&gt; like LaTeX \cite{}, merely an 
observation that underused or abused elements are those without an 
obvious, /user visible/ functionality, probably one that was explicitly 
designed into the element.

&quot;It seems to be a constant throughout history: In every period, people believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you would have gotten in terrible trouble for saying otherwise.&quot;
