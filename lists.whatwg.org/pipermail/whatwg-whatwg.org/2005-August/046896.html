</I>
Should the CSS3 UI spec change, WF2 would change with it. However, I don't 
see how we can make a clarification of intent for another specification 
not depend on that specification.


&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> Matches form control elements that have the readonly attribute set,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> and to which the readonly attribute applies (thus radio buttons will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> never match this, regardless of the value of the attribute), as well
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> as other elements defined by this specification that are defined as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;|<i> read-only under the CSS3 Basic User Interface Module.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, looking at the first part (which is pretty much identical to 
</I>&gt;<i> what you have), it's in conflict with CSS3-UI, because &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;radio&quot; disabled&gt; technically matches the CSS3-UI definition 
</I>&gt;<i> :read-only selector.
</I>
I discussed this with some CSSWG members, and our conclusion was that 
:<i>read-only and :disabled being orthogonal was the most useful, which is 
</I>why I wrote the WF2 spec the way I did.


&gt;<i> With regard to the entire section, note that :enabled, :disabled, 
</I>&gt;<i> :checked and :indeterminate are defined by CSS3 Selectors, not CSS3-UI. 
</I>&gt;<i> The latter spec only defines some details of the :active pseudo-class. 
</I>
Good catch, fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; The whole point of the section is to say which elements defined by WF2 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; match the definition of CSS3 UI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS3-UI is quite clear about that. Anything, and I mean ANYTHING, that 
</I>&gt;<i> is not &quot;user-alterable&quot; is :read-only under CSS3-UI. Even disabled 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input&gt; controls are user-alterable. That's why any implication that a 
</I>&gt;<i> disabled radio button is not :read-only would be a contradiction of the 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS3-UI specification.
</I>
Since that was apparently not the intent of the specification, it isn't as 
clear as we might have hoped! :-) Hence the much more specific definitions 
here. (What does &quot;user alterable&quot; mean? With the Mozilla DOM Inspector I 
can &quot;alter&quot; anything in any DOM.)


&gt;<i> &gt; One possibility would be viewing a database view where the user has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rights to edit a field on some records but not others (e.g. allowed to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; edit the customer's start date but only if the customer hasn't started 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet). As you flip through records, the field becomes read-only or not. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not disabled, because the data is still relevant, even though it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't be edited. (Indeed in XForms &quot;enabled&quot; is spelt &quot;relevant&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IIRC.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you suggesting we expand &lt;fieldset&gt; to include |disabled| and
</I>&gt;<i> |readonly| properties that are inherited by child controls?
</I>
Disabled is already done. &quot;readonly&quot; I'm less sure about, but I have added 
it to the list of things to consider for WF3.


&gt;<i> That may not be such a bad idea. (BTW, I've already reconsidered my 
</I>&gt;<i> position on whether |disabled| and |readonly| are mutually exclusive. 
</I>&gt;<i> They are not.)
</I>
I think they are. :-) If they were not, why would they be independent 
attributes? Even in XForms the two concepts are separated.
