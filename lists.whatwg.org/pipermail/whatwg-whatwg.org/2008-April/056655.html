<PRE>
The HTMLWG's ISSUE-31 is &quot;Should img without alt ever be conforming&quot;.

It isn't clear from this issue what exactly the problem with the current 
spec text is. The current text in the spec requires alt=&quot;&quot; in all cases 
except when the page is generated in a manner where alternative text is 
not available, or when there is no possible way to provide text that is 
in any way a replacement for the image.

Two examples are given, namely a photo upload site, and a Rorschach 
inkblot test. In the former case, the image is generated automatically and 
the program simply does not have enough information to provide alternative 
text. In the latter case, _any_ description would miss the point of the 
test (which is to see what descriptions people come up with). The spec 
contains very strong wording requiring alternative text in all manner of 
possible situations, and encouraging it even in the aforementioned cases. 
I'm not sure what else we can do short of just making it non-conforming to 
create bulk-upload image hosting sites or write documents that contain 
inkblot tests.

If the issue's title is ever to be answered in the negative, it would be 
helpful for solutions to the two examples above to be provided.

I've closed the issue, to indicate that I have examined it in detail and 
come to a tentative conclusion. Further input from anyone, but in 
particular the PFWG, is welcome and encouraged; if anyone disagrees with 
this issue they are of course encouraged to reopen the issue in the issue 
database, preferably at the same time as providing further information to 
help answer the issues given above. :-)


Here are some answers to other issues raised on the topic:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, the other 5 percent would ruin the idea. When 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screenreaders are wading through inaccessibly-written pages, sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; images are used for navigation (graphical menus, for example), so the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user needs an indication that an image is there (whereupon they can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess its function by its URI). Assuming that all these images had 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alt=&quot;&quot; would make such pages completely unnavigable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both this and the other point that Jim made (implied alt is hard to 
</I>&gt;<i> debug) strongly suggest that alt should be optional, not implied. The 
</I>&gt;<i> lack of an alt attribute would legitimize any inference about suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative text that the web browser wanted to perform. Therefore it 
</I>&gt;<i> would remain best practice to explicitly declare alt=&quot;&quot; where the image 
</I>&gt;<i> is purely decorative. I expect many web developers would favor this 
</I>&gt;<i> approach since the validator complaining about a lack of alt=&quot;&quot; has been 
</I>&gt;<i> perceived as unnecessary nannying and so the requirement has widely been 
</I>&gt;<i> ignored. Making alt optional probably wouldn't damage accessibility as 
</I>&gt;<i> much as might be thought because a) bad alt text is at least as bad as 
</I>&gt;<i> missing alt text and b) there exist other tools that explicitly check 
</I>&gt;<i> documents for accessibility which could flag missing alt attributes.
</I>
This is the reasoning behind the current wording of the specification.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alt should be required on inputs of type=image, area elements, and perhaps

</I>
The form control issues (input type=image) are pending a result from the 
forms task force (I don't want to write that part of the spec only to find 
the whole thing has to be rewritten).

Omitted alt=&quot;&quot; attributes only make sense (and are only, reluctantly, 
allowed) when the site serving the image simply has no idea what the image 
is, but knows that it is important.

One could easily imagine a situation where that is the case, but where the 
image is in a link. For example, any image on Flickr that doesn't have 
useful metadata falls into this category.

Thus I don't think we can make that requirement, as it would only lead to 
nonsense alt text or the concept of validity being ignored altogether.


&gt;<i> As a person who works in the area of accessibility, I'm inclined to 
</I>&gt;<i> agree that alt doesn't really need to be required.  What is unusual is 
</I>&gt;<i> that not only is this a solid idea theoretically, but the user agent 
</I>&gt;<i> base supports it already.
</I>
That's good to know.


&gt;<i> Users can, and probably would continue to be able to, get their user 
</I>&gt;<i> agent to voice all images without regard to the presence of alt if they 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted. Having alt be required is an argument that assumes that 
</I>&gt;<i> developers will examine their images more carefully in order to achieve 
</I>&gt;<i> valid code. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to really work, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> important task of adding quality equivalents for just important images 
</I>&gt;<i> is often lost in the sea of unimportant images that need alt=&quot;&quot;.
</I>
Agreed.

I imagine we will require this, assuming we keep &lt;input type=image&gt;.

Sadly &lt;image&gt; as a tag name is taken by the legacy content (and maps

I don't see a pragmatic reason to support this over &lt;object&gt; (unlike

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be included, with a useful value, if at all possible. If an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; image is a key part of the content, the alt attribute must not be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specified with an empty value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The following is my proposed replacement:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In some cases, the image is a critical part of the content.  This could 
</I>&gt;<i> be the case, for instance, in a photo gallery, a series of screenshots, 
</I>&gt;<i> or a comic strip.  In such cases, authors should provide suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> alternate text.  When suitable alternate text is available, it must be 
</I>&gt;<i> included in the alt attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;figure&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;legend&gt;Cat Proximity&lt;/legend&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;<A HREF="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cat_proximity.png">http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cat_proximity.png</A>&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>      alt=&quot;As a human approaches a cat, intelligence decreases and the
</I>&gt;<i>           inanity of statements increases. e.g. A man says to a cat:
</I>&gt;<i>           'You're a kitty!'&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      title=&quot;Yes you are!  And you're sitting there!  Hi, kitty!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/figure&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, even if an authoring tool allows for alternate text to be provided,
</I>&gt;<i> there are some cases where authors will still fail to do so. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> where a user has uploaded 3000 photos from a vacation trip, without providing
</I>&gt;<i> any descriptions of the images.  In those cases, the alt attribute must be
</I>&gt;<i> omitted; it must not be specified with an empty value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [insert remaining content, beginning with the photo sharing and screenshot
</I>&gt;<i> examples]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>
I haven't used exactly the above, but I've used something like it.


&gt;<i> The spec could possibly also include a requirement for authoring tools 
</I>&gt;<i> to provide a mechanism for the author to provide alt text, perhaps with 
</I>&gt;<i> a reference to the ATAG spec.
</I>
I'm not sure that would be useful.

I'm not really sure what to say about either that would help.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the web, images are used in various ways.  Sometimes, an image is

</I>&gt;<i> [1] &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;home.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Home&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;about.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;About Us&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;store.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Store&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no disagreement that alternate text is correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes images are not iconic, but are integral to the meaning of a page:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [2] &lt;img src=&quot;grand-canyon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The grand canyon as viewed from
</I>&gt;<i> the east at sunset&quot;&gt;
</I>
That's appropriate title=&quot;&quot; text, not alt=&quot;&quot; text, for what it's worth.


&gt;<i> Clearly, that text can't be considered an equivalent for the image -
</I>&gt;<i> can a few words replace the grand canyon?  No, the the presence of the
</I>&gt;<i> image is important.  A screen reader user needs the presence of the
</I>&gt;<i> image announced so that the user knows they're hearing a description
</I>&gt;<i> of a picture and not a random sentence out of context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, since JAWS can't really tell the difference between [1] and [2],
</I>&gt;<i> it sounds from your tests that JAWS announces the presence of the
</I>&gt;<i> image.  If it announces the presence of every image [1] gets read as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Linked Graphic Home Linked Graphic About Us Linked Graphic Store ...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Does a blind person really need to be taunted with the presence of 5
</I>&gt;<i> or 6 images in a navigational menu?  On the other hand, if JAWS did
</I>&gt;<i> NOT announce the presence of an image, [2] would just be read as &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> grand canyon as viewed from the east at sunset&quot; - a single sentence
</I>&gt;<i> out of context with no indication that there's an image.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> Since @alt is required by HTML4, we often see authors insert text even
</I>&gt;<i> when it doesn't belong, such as a list of icons accompanied by text:
</I>&gt;<i> [3] &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;home.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;about.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;About Us&quot;&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;store.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Store&quot;&gt;Store&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;
</I>
This, as noted in the spec, is bad practice, as you note:

&gt;<i> This, even without announcing the presence of an image, is confusing
</I>&gt;<i> when read as &quot;Home Home About Us About Us Store Store Blog Blog&quot;.  So,
</I>&gt;<i> authors are encourages to simply leave @alt blank:
</I>&gt;<i> [4] &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;home.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;about.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;store.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Store&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;blog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That way, a screenreader knows to ignore the image.
</I>
Right.

&gt;<i> But since authors are allowed to just leave @alt blank, they may not
</I>&gt;<i> bother describing the grand canyon:
</I>&gt;<i> [5] &lt;img src=&quot;grand-canyon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>
They might not bother whether they're allowed to or not. :-)


&gt;<i> Using the logic from [4], the screenreader might think the image can be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the problem the draft attempts to solve.  It distinguishes 
</I>&gt;<i> between [4] (a graphic that can be ignored) and [5] (a meaningful 
</I>&gt;<i> graphic where the author refused to give any helpful text).  My 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion earlier in this thread was to use @title to describe a 
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful image so there is some accessible text without implying that 
</I>&gt;<i> text is &quot;equivalent&quot; to the image.
</I>
That would be reasonable, yes.

Is the example for &quot;Movies&quot; and &quot;Podcasts&quot; not enough? It's the same idea.
