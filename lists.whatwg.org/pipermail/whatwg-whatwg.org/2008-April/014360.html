This is one of the reasons for the &quot;C&quot; in CSS. Further and/or higher 
changes must cascade and affect the document.

&gt;&gt;<i>  I have proposed a solution that greatly simplifies effecting canvas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  shapes with CSS. Anne and Thomas have offered two work-arounds, one of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  slightly less complex.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anne also proposed you the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work:

</I>&gt;<i> I understand what you're asking for, I just don't see the need, as it

</I>&gt;<i> that you don't &quot;support&quot; in your drawing script.
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, as Matthieu said, canvas is imperative while CSS is

</I>&gt;<i> you can do is read values from the CSS and use them in your canvas
</I>&gt;<i> script.
</I>
This is screaming over-engineering. There is a standard to do that, and 
more, already and it's called SVG.

&gt;<i> In my opinion, you'd rather have a script consisting only of variable
</I>&gt;<i> definitions (&#224; la *.ini or *.properties files) and have your designers
</I>&gt;<i> only update this file (and never touch nor even see the script
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for the actual drawing).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, given than there are multiple ways of solving the problem
</I>&gt;<i> (including ones allowing you to read values from CSS), I suggest
</I>&gt;<i> pushing the debate to a later &lt;canvas&gt; version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In brief, if you really want to style diagrams using CSS, use SVG, or
</I>&gt;<i> just don't complain that doing it with &lt;canvas&gt; is tricky.
