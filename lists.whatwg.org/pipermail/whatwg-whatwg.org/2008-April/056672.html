</I>&gt;<i> that words are used in such a way as to undermine their surface meaning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can undermine your own words more or less explicitly. On the one 
</I>&gt;<i> hand, you can give your audience no formal clues and depend entirely on 
</I>&gt;<i> common notions shared with audience (say, about the excellence of US 
</I>&gt;<i> presidents) for your disavowal to be detected, as with deadpan sarcasm 
</I>&gt;<i> and a lot of satire. Alternatively, you can rely on various conventions 
</I>&gt;<i> to modify the meaning of what is said, such as a nasal tone of voice, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;air quotes&quot;, and &quot;scare quotes&quot;. For this more explicit disavowal, TEI 
</I>&gt;<i> includes a fabulous &lt;soCalled&gt; element:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Talking browsers and screen readers offer a good justification for using 
</I>&gt;<i> markup in addition to punctuation for sarcasm. In Western languages at 
</I>&gt;<i> least, it is only through markup that can they clearly distinguish 
</I>&gt;<i> direct speech, quotation, and sarcasm, and assign them different voices. 
</I>&gt;<i> Quotation punctuation is far more fluid and ambiguous than other 
</I>&gt;<i> punctuation like commas, semicolons, question marks, full stops, and 
</I>&gt;<i> exclamation marks. So Alexey's analogy with how we treat more reliable 
</I>&gt;<i> punctuation is problematic.

My timing is completely unintentional, I assure you.

I read all of the above, and gave this idea much more consideration than 
it probably deserves. I also studied various typographic conventions, and 
studied potential use cases, other vocabularies, and so forth.

I do not believe that starting down this slippery slope will get us enough 
benefits to outweigh the costs involved. It isn't at all clear when we 
would have to stop (just look at the proposals above, which quickly went 
from just indicating sarcasm to pointing out other kinds of humour, other 
emotions, etc).

I also believe that the rather limited success that analogous proposals 
have enjoyed in print typography over the years should be a warning sign 
for us to avoid introducing any explicit markup for this.

As has been noted, class keywords can be used for this purpose on a 
site-by-site basis.

We have such a way -- defining Microformats based on existing 
vocabularies. I think providing such a microformat based on the results of 
the aforementioned incubator group would be a good way to experiment with 
this and help gain us some &quot;in the wild&quot; experience. If such experience is 
positive, then it would be something to revisit.
