To be more clear, the intent of my statement was &quot;if you're going to make it
synchronous, then really make it synchronous and have postMessage return a
value.  Or else make it fully asynchronous.  But the current state is
synchronous yet doesn't return a value, so you don't get the best of either
world.&quot;  I feel like that was a point raised before, but I can't remember :)

To follow up on other points in your email:

* I too am very interested in Maciej's points re: partitioning browsing
contexts and Gears-style workers.  Without concrete examples of how these
would work today I haven't had any compelling arguments to make on this
list, but these sorts of things are driving some of my concerns about being
locked into a synchronous API.  Async APIs seem more future-proof in a world
where we start supporting more threading/process models in web apps or make
UAs multiprocess (as IE8 seems to be doing with their tab crash recovery
system).  I am aware that there are existing synchronization/serialization
requirements, but perhaps they can be solved; certainly adding more won't
make the task easier.  Perhaps Microsoft has insight here.

* On the other-hand, perhaps we can just ship Fx3 as-is, and if down the
road we become convinced that the API needs to change, we change it.  That's
what happened with global/local storage and Firefox 2, right?  (Or I suppose
if Mozilla is really concerned about this issue, postMessage could be pulled
from Fx3 as cross-domain XHR was, though that seems pretty drastic.)
