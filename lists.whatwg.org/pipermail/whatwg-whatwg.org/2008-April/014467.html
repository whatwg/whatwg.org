</I>&gt;<i> This fulfills the basic idea, though the spec seems to leave the
</I>&gt;<i> resize mechanism up to the imaginations of the UAs. All it says is
</I>&gt;<i> that the resize mechanism is not a scrollbar. Using the element
</I>&gt;<i> borders might be one option for a resize mechanism. I imagine the CSS3
</I>&gt;<i> authors may have felt it out of their scope to try to define a resize
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism since it is a UI element. Though my particular idea may or
</I>&gt;<i> may not be a good one, it does beg the question as to whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> there should be HTML elements that can be used for such things and
</I>&gt;<i> that developers can then style and customize themselves rather than
</I>&gt;<i> being stuck with the various UA implementations that may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> work well with specific web application designs. Also, due to the
</I>&gt;<i> vagueness of the specification the implementations could vary quite
</I>&gt;<i> wildy from one browser to another. Do the resize mechanisms go on the
</I>&gt;<i> inside of the element, on the outside, centered on the edge? What
</I>&gt;<i> shape are they, circles, squares, rectangles? Are they as tall or wide
</I>&gt;<i> as the element or are they just little icons centered on each edge and
</I>&gt;<i> at the corners? If the element that is being resized has rounded
</I>&gt;<i> corners does the UI still look good? Are they simple in design or are
</I>&gt;<i> they shaded and intricate? Are they visible at all, or does the cursor
</I>&gt;<i> merely change when the mouse is over them? As a designer and developer
</I>&gt;<i> these are things I would like to have some control over.
</I>
If you want full control you probably have to implement it yourself.


&gt;<i> Regarding a couple of the new UI elements in HTML5, it is not clear to
</I>&gt;<i> me from the spec if the meter and progress elements are purely UA
</I>&gt;<i> designed elements or if the developer has control over their styling.
</I>
You can probably style them using XBL in due course. They are similar to  
form controls as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> With the HTML5 drag and drop, can you specify a handle for the dragged
</I>&gt;<i> element(s) or are the dragged element(s) always their own handle(drag
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism)?
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean here.


&gt;<i> No, though after looking at these links the non-canvas part does
</I>&gt;<i> indeed appear to be more in the realm of the CSS3 spec. Where HTML
</I>&gt;<i> ends and CSS begins can be a little fuzzy for me. Regardless, to
</I>&gt;<i> clarify, if you have a div that is 100x100 pixels and you add a 5px
</I>&gt;<i> border, you will now have an element with dimensions of 105x105px.
</I>&gt;<i> This is because the border is aligned to the outside of the element.
</I>&gt;<i> If you animate the size of the border the element will grow and shrink
</I>&gt;<i> in size. If the border were added on the inside the element will
</I>&gt;<i> remain 100x100px wide regardless of the border size, but the content
</I>&gt;<i> size would shrink and expand.
</I>
Oh, you want 'box-sizing':

(This property has several UA implementations already. Some with a prefix  
only, admittedly.)
