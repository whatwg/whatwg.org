<PRE>Although providing the footnote as a tool-tip 
seems appealing at the first glance, 
it is not exactly how it should be done.
Footnotes are commonly used for bibliographic references; 
using the title attribute seems to be a non-solution in this case.  
Text of such &quot;footnotes&quot; cannot be copied 
and they cannot contain hyperlinks.

I think the CSS stuff is less of a big deal than you make it out to be, 
but I agree in general with those comments.

All good points.



&gt;<i> &gt; One thing to consider when looking at footnotes is &quot;would the title=&quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute handle this use case as well as what I'm proposing?&quot;. If the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;almost&quot;, then it's probably not a good idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduce the new feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't think so.  There are accessibility and usability issues
</I>with
&gt;<i> the title attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Screen readers don't read the title attribute by default.
</I>&gt;<i> * Tooltips are inaccessible (in current implementations) to keyboard
</I>users,
&gt;<i> they require hovering with a mouse.
</I>&gt;<i> * Users have no clear way of identifying which content has a tool tip,
</I>except
&gt;<i> for maybe abbr and acronym (which get a dotted border in FF).
</I>&gt;<i> * It's also limited to plain text, when even the example from wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> contains additional markup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first 3 issues could possibly be addressed by changing the 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering, but how do you identify a regular title attribute from one 
</I>&gt;<i> intended to be a footnote?  Would it be appropriate for all of them to 
</I>&gt;<i> be treated as footnotes? I don't think so.
</I>
Wouldn't it?


&gt;<i> When an author cannot got hold of a work herself, she must sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i> cite a citation of that work in second work. This is what the 
</I>&gt;<i> abbreviation cit. is for. And sometimes a citation refers to more than 
</I>&gt;<i> one version of a work. Here's an example out of the Oxford Style Guide:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> J. D. Denniston, /The Greek Particles/ (Oxford, 1934; citations are from 
</I>&gt;<i> the 2nd edn., 1954).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without more clarity (and that partly means examples) on how &lt;cite /&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> should apply to the complexity of real academic citations, I'd avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> making the assumption that &lt;cite /&gt; cannot contain &lt;cite /&gt; -- for now.
</I>
&lt;cite&gt; is now defined to mean &quot;title of work&quot;.
