<PRE>
&lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; were discussed by various people in various threads in 
over the past few years.

I haven't changed anything in the spec in response to these suggestions. 
As discussed below, the elements aren't used much. They are useful to some 
extent and not really causing any harm, but they aren't used enough that 
it would make sense for us to go out of our way to really fix them up and 
make them better (e.g. in the way that &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are used enough that 
it made sense for us to go ahead and introduce a bunch of sectioning 
elements to better handle those cases, or the way that JS toolbars and 
DHTML menus are used enough that it makes sense for us to introduce &lt;menu&gt; 
and &lt;command&gt;).

410 Gone seems like the better solution for that.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What XHTML2 does makes more sense to me (introducing a global

I assume your opinion has changed. :-)


&gt;<i> |edit=&quot;&quot;| is easier to use for tools that compare documents and only

</I>
I'm not really sure that this supposed ease outweighs the backwards- 
compatibility story.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Now if you could say somehow that the contents of some element have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; been modified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can. Wrap those bits you removed in a &lt;del&gt; and wrap the new bits

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That information is almost never stored. It would also make software

</I>
Wikis seem to handle this ok now... &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; are more like what you 
would use on a diff page than on the final document. I'm not sure what 
problem we are really trying to solve here.

Indeed, to add an item you have to do:

   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;ins&gt;...&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;

...which I agree is suboptimal, but I think it's probably acceptable 
really. That is, the cost of allowing the other option is probably higher 
than the benefit gained from it. (e.g. it makes writing editors much 
easier if you know a list is only going to have list items in it.)

Or bits inside each item/cell, sure. Tables in particular are a pain

</I>
I agree that this is an issue, but I'm not sure how to handle it. Leaving 
data out is all very well, but it means that we can't use (e.g.) the JS 
&quot;Date&quot; object to represent the data, as we really have to represent any 
time specified on the element as _two_ times now -- the start and the end 
of the period (or the middle and the error margin, or some such). This 
gets even more complex when you can't then express two times as a single 
time with missing precision (e.g. 02:00 to 03:00 is just &quot;02&quot;, but what is 
02:00 to 02:30?). These problems I think would lead to issues in 
implementations that would then show up in markup as anomalies. I'm not 
sure the gain is worth that.

What's the harm in being over-precise?

I _have_ removed the concept of &quot;00&quot; meaning unknown. Now, all dates are 
(over-)precise moments in time.

For lists it probably could be helped, though at a cost. For tables I

The &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; elements aren't really used enough to warrant adding

&lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; are defined to not be allowed in the above contexts; is 
that enough, or do you want an example showing how to use &lt;ins&gt;/&lt;/del&gt; in 
lists (like the examples above)?

Yeah; I think before we add more stuff to support &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;, we 
should wait to see if anyone is able to use them, maybe in conjunction 
with custom data-* attributes and classes, to do something useful.

I'd rather leave cite=&quot;&quot; in for now, and remove it at the CR stage if we 
can't get two complete implementations of HTML5 because of this feature. 
(Same applies to &lt;q cite&gt; and &lt;blockquote cite&gt;.)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most common example of that is a selection starting with a paragraph

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;li&gt;another list item level 1&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To delete the selection, you need three del elements, one being 
</I>&gt;<i> block-level, the two others being inline-level (please note a li element 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be contained inside a del element, and it's painful...) :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;del&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/del&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;ul&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;ul&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;li&gt;another list item level 1&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From an editing perspective, that's hell. Another solution used a lot in 
</I>&gt;<i> SGML editing environments is called Paired Elements and it's able to 
</I>&gt;<i> better represent the selection :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;del id=&quot;foo&quot; end=&quot;bar&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;ul&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;li&gt;another list item level 1&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For people with enough SGML background, think IDREF.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's harder to style but that's MUCH easier to edit, and the ins and

</I>
It seems like what you'd want is to convert lengths of &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; 
elements into paired elements when loading an HTML file, have the editor 
work on those elements, and then reserialise such paired elements to &lt;ins&gt; 
and &lt;del&gt; elements on the backend. Wouldn't that be the best of both 
worlds? (The other world being backwards compatibility -- you'd need to 
support converting &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; to the new format anyway, and 
reserialising it seems like the easy part.)

I think we want to be precise in these definitions, since there are going

Do we really want to break the invariant that &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; always contain

Red tag names mean that the element has two parents.

I don't think we'd really want to have the paired elements in the markup 
itself; as you say, they could lead to all kinds of weird meaningless 
markup. I do think the idea makes sense for editors, though; as mentioned 
earlier, the most logical behaviour as far as I can tell would be for an 
editor to convert &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; markup to ranges on parsing, and to 
reinsert them when serialising. That lets the user (author) have a nice 
logical UI presented to him, while being compatible with existing content 
and UAs, without the editor having to deal with painful &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; 
elements in the DOM.
