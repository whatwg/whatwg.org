Summary: I've made the spec require that any punctuation for &lt;q&gt; be 
included inside the element; I've added examples for &lt;q&gt;.

Well, we have an element (&lt;q&gt;), the problem is what to do with the 
quotation marks.

</I>
I would introduce two pseudo-elements, ::quote-start and ::quote-end, 
which match one or more characters with the Quotation_Mark property (as 
per Unicode PropList) found at the start or end of an element, if such 
text is a direct child of the element (skipping White_Space characters).

I've started this idea down the path of the CSS working group.

I agree that introducing a new element just to solve the problem isn't 
really a good solution.

I agree that the CSS should be able to override quotation punctuation.

Would it work if we required all punctuation to be included in the source 
(inside the &lt;q&gt; element), and provided the above-suggested pseudo-elements 
to deal with styling?

Did you ever receive a reply to that e-mail?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (author-provided), then provides complex CSS that can select those

</I>
Well, other than some minor growing pains with &lt;q&gt; for a few years, what's 
the problem with reusing &lt;q&gt;? It's shorter and people already know about 
it. Somewhat. (It's hardly ever used, really. Less than &lt;blink&gt; and 
&lt;ilayer&gt; according to my studies.)


&gt;<i> as well as being able to replace &lt;blockquote&gt;?
</I>
Why would we do that?

That seems reasonable. I'll make the rendering section require that in due 
course.
