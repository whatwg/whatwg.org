</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Summary: I've made the title=&quot;&quot; attribute on &lt;abbr&gt; optional again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we need a smart validator that maintains a set of abbreviations
</I>&gt;<i> it comes across, if an &lt;abbr&gt; with no title attribute is encountered
</I>&gt;<i> that isn't in the set of already seen abbreviations, a message is
</I>&gt;<i> displayed to the web developer saying the new abbreviation should have
</I>&gt;<i> a title.
</I>
Possibly that would useful for web authors.  But it wouldn't be any sort
of 'validator', since the reason that expansion-less abbreviations are
permitted in HTML 5 is so that abbreviations may be styled in a
particular way (for example with small caps).

That is therefore a valid thing to do whether or not the abbreviation
happens to be expanded anywhere else in the document.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why should HTML 5 bother to solve the very narrow case of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a good point. Smylers, do you think we should remove abbr
</I>&gt;<i> altogether and leave solutions to ambiguity problems to something
</I>&gt;<i> other than HTML?
</I>
No; &lt;abbr&gt; with an expansion is useful, particularly for abbreviations
coined by the author which readers may not be in a position to otherwise
know, or to look up elsewhere.  And there are user-agents which make the
expansion available.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I meant was you were just addressing people's points as they came

</I>
That is very methodical; it ensures that every point brought up gets
considered.

&gt;<i> If we want to do this properly we need to ensure we have covered every
</I>&gt;<i> aspect from the beginning.
</I>
You want Ian to consider points that haven't been raised?  Surely the
best way of doing that is simply to raise those points?

&gt;<i> Set up a focus group or something :)
</I>
What could a focus group say that people can't do here?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Situations where expansions of abbreviations are needed: It should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not be required that the user screw around looking for the acronym
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with a dotted underline.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Abbreviations are no more special here than any term of art.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> except that HTML in is past incarnations provided a solution. The
</I>&gt;<i> difference has already been created.
</I>
It has?  Please could you give an example of an existing webpage which
successfully uses an &lt;abbr&gt; element without a title and which an
existing user-agent does something useful with that.

&gt;<i> &gt; It's quite obvious that the &quot;BAR&quot; in &quot;RAISE THE BAR&quot; is not an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acronym.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only if you know English. ('you' being the User Agent who has to
</I>&gt;<i> decide how to expand/pronounce it). It is not reasonable to expect
</I>&gt;<i> UAs, other than perhaps TTS engines, to correctly identify this.
</I>
Why would a user-agent that isn't speaking need to correctly identify
it?

&gt;<i> And to the person who suggested it be written in lowercase, I
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly said it was a newspaper headline.
</I>
That was me.  Sorry, I interpreted that to mean a headline on a
newspaper's website; I hadn't realized you meant transcribing from a
printed newspaper.

&gt;<i> You should not change the case of printed material when transferring
</I>&gt;<i> it to electronic form, reproductions should be faithful to the
</I>&gt;<i> original, and use uppercase characters rather than style
</I>&gt;<i> transformations (since they might not get applied).
</I>
On that basis one could argue for not transcribing it at all, but
instead including it as a giant image, to avoid any other changes.

Or that headings shouldn't be marked up with &lt;h1&gt; and so on but simply
with by setting the appropriate font, since otherwise a browser may not
style the &lt;h1&gt;s appropriately.

(Conversely, one could argue that what's important is to transcribe the
semantics, and where that includes 'headlines are normal sentences but
the house style is to display them in all-caps' then it's reasonable to
mark them up as I suggested.)

If the aim is simply to reproduce the printed page exactly then the
original doesn't have any out-of-band indication as to whether &quot;BAR&quot; is
a word or an abbreviation (or indeed both, as a pun); why should the web
representation?
