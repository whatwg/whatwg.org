<PRE>I'm still wondering if HTML5 should define an element for less than
normal importance or emphasis.

</I>
So &lt;small&gt; means less important than normal (default) importance of
plain text, if I've understood correctly when used outside &lt;em&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;. However, it does not lower the importance/emphasis of &lt;em&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;. I don't like this difference.

Is there a difference in the semantics of these two examples:

1) &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License: GFDL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
and
2) &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;License: GFDL&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ?

Does the &lt;small&gt; element mean different things when it's a child of
&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; or any other element?

</I>
If I have a sentence where the less important part is in the middle of
the sentence but the whole sentence is important, I would want to mark
up the whole sentence as a single element. I think that there's a
difference between

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An important sentence &lt;small&gt;with less important part&lt;/small&gt;
continues...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An important sentence&lt;/strong&gt; with less important part
&lt;strong&gt; continues...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps it's just me, but I think that the latter markup represents that
there're two separate important parts in that paragraph. I think there
should be exactly one important part and one less important part.

I assume you meant &quot;what would this element mean?&quot;.

&lt;dem&gt; would mean &quot;less emphasized / lower importance than the
surrounding content&quot;. I believe that the separation between less
emphasized and lowered importance is not required so only one element is
enough.

&gt;&gt;<i> And why do I think that &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;small&gt; are different from &lt;dem&gt;? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because I think &lt;aside&gt; (or a footnote) is something you can safely 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignore and is usually orthogonal to the rest of the content. &lt;small&gt; is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something you usually skip but you must be aware of the content (e.g. a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copyright or license boilerplate) - the key here is that the content is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often repeated but if you have read it *once*, then you may skip it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later. The &lt;dem&gt; would be something that you may skip without reading it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> once but which is not orthogonal to the rest of the content and as such 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't be considered equal to &lt;aside&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	&lt;p&gt;One should &lt;em&gt;never execute &lt;code&gt;rm -rf /&lt;/code&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	in a UNIX shell &lt;dem&gt;because doing so would remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	everything in the system&lt;/dem&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here I think that the explanation is also something that should be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emphasized. However, the reader can safely ignore the explanation. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that &lt;dem&gt; shouldn't be considered to be equal strength to &lt;em&gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but something less. Logically it could be -0.5 emphasis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;One should &lt;strong&gt;never execute &lt;code&gt;rm -rf /&lt;/code&gt; in a UNIX 
</I>&gt;<i>    shell&lt;/strong&gt; (because doing so would remove everything in the 
</I>&gt;<i>    system).&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...? That seems cleaner and just as clear.
</I>
For plain text case I agree that using the parenthesis is enough.
However, if the content is something else but just plain text (an
&lt;object&gt; for example) an element is required to mark up the semantics.

However, I agree that default rendering for such markup is hard to
define. Any variation in text style can easily understood as positive
emphasis and a generic rendering of lower than normal importance
&lt;object&gt; is really hard to define.

In the end, perhaps &lt;small&gt; should be used for de-emphasis of any
content other than plain text. Parenthesis can then be used for
de-emphasis of normal content.
