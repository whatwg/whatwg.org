<PRE>
I haven't done anything with xml:space. It doesn't do anything, and it's 
not an HTML5 thing, so as far as I can tell it is out of scope for HTML5.

</I>&gt;<i> If that's too permissive, here's what would minimally cover my use case:

I don't see why we should special-case this particular harmless non-HTML 
feature, and not any number of other harmless non-HTML features. If 
another specification wants to define something, then it's up to that 
specification to define when it can be used.

Forgeting it seems fine to me...

</I>&gt;<i> Well, considering the purpose of XHTML (main purpose is presentation for 
</I>&gt;<i> humans, no?) is there any reason to NOT just set it to default to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;preserve&quot; on the html element, fixed to &quot;preserve&quot; on the script, 
</I>&gt;<i> style, pre and textarea elements and have it implied through an entity 
</I>&gt;<i> for all other elements? Style sheets can change whether presentation of 
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace is collapsed or not. By default, the whitespace is collapsed 
</I>&gt;<i> but for the pre element it's conserved, but that can overridden by user 
</I>&gt;<i> or author style sheets. But whitespace that is structurally collapsed at 
</I>&gt;<i> the XML level cannot be restored for presentation by the style sheet, so 
</I>&gt;<i> this whitespace is lost from ever being presented as it appeared in the 
</I>&gt;<i> document.
</I>
xml:space doesn't allow whitepsace to be collapsed at the XML level as far 
as I can tell.

</I>
&quot;Valid&quot; in XML is only relevant for DTDs.

</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, reading the relevant part of the XML1.0 spec again, I see you're 
</I>&gt;<i> right. So, it would seem to me that it's an attribute describing 
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace semantics in content, not a structural attribute like I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought. So, say you have a &lt;poetry:poem&gt; element, but where the element 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics doesn't specify whether whitespace is important in the poem or 
</I>&gt;<i> not (it might be, but that depends on the poem content), you can specify 
</I>&gt;<i> it in that attribute.
</I>
Seems like it'd be better for the spec itself to define the semantics of 
its elements rather than depend on the author to specify the attribute...

It seems that given the importance of XHTML, we can expect pretty printers 
to be written for it.

File a bug with them. :-)

Indeed.
