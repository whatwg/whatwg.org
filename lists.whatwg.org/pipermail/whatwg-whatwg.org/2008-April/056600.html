Sometimes, for the large applications; small apps won't care.  As you note, the workaround of immediately packaging up a setTimeout continuation isn't difficult.  I tend to think worrying about the N-1 case is designing a bit too much for the special cases, personally.  Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.[0]  Further, nothing says browser implementations must or will continue to enforce hard limits on recursion.

&gt;<i> function messageHandler(messageEvent) {
</I>&gt;<i> // We assume calling into our complex functions might run out of stack 
</I>&gt;<i> space, so we just handle this in a timeout:
</I>&gt;<i> setTimeout(0, function() { realMessageHandler(messageEvent) } );
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> function realMessageHandler(messageEvent) {
</I>&gt;<i>  // handle the message...
</I>&gt;<i>  // and, reply to the message
</I>&gt;<i>  messageEvent.source.postMessage(&quot;response message&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
Furthermore, note that the above behavior is actually *insecure* if the handler authenticates the sender and discloses some secret in his response, because |messageEvent.source| may have been navigated to a different origin.  Making the API async basically requires the optional origin argument always be provided to postMessage, adding API complexity.  If a piece of information doesn't have to be [present] for the system to [usually] work, sooner or later it won't be [and the system won't work].[1]


&gt;<i> I forsee JS authors implementing their own asynchronous behavior, as 
</I>&gt;<i> shown above.
</I>
I do, too, in some cases; I just don't think it's worth sacrificing simplicity or security in the common case for the special, rare case.


&gt;<i> 2.  JS engine implementors will want an async API.
</I>
&gt;<i> I would rather we didn't prevent FireFox or Safari
</I>
&quot;Firefox&quot;, the second &quot;f&quot; isn't capitalized.  :-)
 
&gt;<i> (Only possible for frames which are not of the same origin.   Same-origin
</I>&gt;<i> frames already assume they can grab at each others innards in a 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous manner.)  postMessage imposes a NEW requirement that all 
</I>&gt;<i> connected frames to be run from the same thread (or somehow synchronize 
</I>&gt;<i> the threads after the first postMessage() call is made).
</I>
Wrong; if a window can get a reference to another window, same-origin or not, run-to-completion already requires synchronous behavior.  If some piece of JS is in flight, every client-side change it can detect *must* be one it has caused.

&gt;<i> This requirement would seem even worse for Microsoft, since IE8 looks like 
</I>&gt;<i> it's multi-process.  A synchronous postMessage would require IE8 to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> all frames which have references to each other in the same process.
</I>
postMessage imposes no new requirement for the appearance of synchrony, no matter how the implementation chooses to achieve it.


Asynchrony was brought up in a separate thread (&quot;[whatwg] reply() extension to postMessage()&quot;) two months ago, before the source-navigation discussion made this secret-exposure danger more easily noticeable.  I made basically the same arguments then as I make now; I also noted that sync can replicate async (again ignoring the uncommon case of being right at the recursion limit), whereas the reverse is not true:

&gt;<i> I think I favor sync postMessage over async because async capabilities 
</I>&gt;<i> are a strict subset of sync capabilities.  You can always use setTimeout 
</I>&gt;<i> with the sync model to get async behavior; if the model is async you 
</I>&gt;<i> can't replicate sync behavior.
</I>
Note also that nothing prevents an implementation with a recursion limit from requiring that postMessage always guarantee enough available frames to dispatch the setTimeout continuation, although nobody I know has actually done this.


In sum, I think worrying about recursion limits is the wrong thing to do, sync behavior is more flexible, and we shouldn't sacrifice security for the uncommon recursion-limit case.

0.  Python, thy name is AWESOME.  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/</A>&gt;
