That's something of a simplification; the word &quot;read&quot; in particular is 
as likely to confuse as to clarify (yes, the name doesn't help here). 
It's the job of a screen reader to provide people with severe visual 
impairments with access to a computer system. That regularly entails 
more than &quot;reading what is displayed on screen&quot;, including also things 
like querying document or application models and constructing further 
internal models on top of those (for example, to produce a list of 
links, or extract hidden help text, or construct a text-stream view of a 
webpage in a virtual buffer).

&quot;A program whose 'job it is to read what is displayed on the screen' &quot; 
works better as a description of simpler text-to-speech programs (which 
also exist).

&gt;<i> with a voice browser, who's job it is to 
</I>&gt;<i> parse a HTML document into a DOM tree and apply media-less and aural CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> (and potentially never display anything on screen).
</I>
I agree it's important to distinguish screen readers from voice 
browsers. Two example differences from an end-user perspective:

1. Screen readers typically provide access to an entire system rather 
than simply being a self-voicing application for browsing the web or an 
application that happens to include speech output.

2. Screen readers also typically output braille. :)

&gt;<i> visibility: hidden and display: none should both hide content from 
</I>&gt;<i> screen readers.
</I>
I don't think it's that clear-cut in theory or practice. Screen readers 
don't map directly to the speech/aural or braille media types. But they 
don't map directly to the screen media type either. They involve 
different modes of access, not just a different media type.
