Would it work well enough?  Is not being able to distinguish
abbreviations from words a significant problem for developers of such
software?

&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that is potentially ambiguous.  But it's the same in books,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; newspapers, and so on, where it turns out not to be much of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But books etc don't have any other way of providing
</I>&gt;<i> disambiguation/structure. Under that reasoning, you could argue that
</I>&gt;<i> there's no need for heading elements etc, as simply having text bigger
</I>&gt;<i> works fine in print, so all we need is a font sizing markup option.
</I>
Not quite the same, since in order to make the text bigger we obviously
need _some_ mark-up (so there's no advantage in it not being
meaningful).

But here we're discussing having mark-up versus not having any mark-up
at all.

&gt;<i> &gt; What in practice would you expect AT to do with this knowledge?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember that most abbreviations that aren't being tagged with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expansions won't be marked up, so AT is going to have to deal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sensibly with that case anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you'd prefer hit and miss heuristics over unambiguous
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation?
</I>
We're going to have heuristics anyway.  Humans can generally distinguish
abbreviations from words, so it isn't too far-fetched to expect AI to be
able to do likewise.

I can see that unambiguous specification is preferable (if it would
work).  But I don't understand why of all the problems trying to
pronounce human languages correctly this particular one is the one that
gets additional help from HTML.
