I've revamped the spec for tabindex=&quot;&quot; based on the feedback below.

</I>&gt;<i> I think tabindex=&quot;&quot; has a number of problems:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Lacking a feature to scope tabindexes into local contexts, which I 
</I>&gt;<i> proposed[1] a while back, makes the feature rather useless for its 
</I>&gt;<i> intended purpose (which, AIUI, was to provide a means for the author to 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a different tab order than the natural one, because he was 
</I>&gt;<i> using, say, form controls in a table where the navigation should go down 
</I>&gt;<i> through the columns rather than row for row).
</I>&gt;<i> [1] <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-August/007228.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-August/007228.html</A>
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> 2) Using tabindex=0 or -1 to indicate whether an element can have focus 
</I>&gt;<i> is arguably bogus IMHO. Whether something is focusable depends on the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> or the device. I don't see any reason why apps would use &lt;span 
</I>&gt;<i> tabindex=0 onclick onkeypress&gt; instead of just using links, form 
</I>&gt;<i> controls, or contenteditable=&quot;&quot; (depending on what you're doing). (If 
</I>&gt;<i> you'd do this because form controls are hard to style, then HTML isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> the place to address that problem.)
</I>
While I agree in principle, it's clear that there is a demand for custom 
widgets, and since people are going to do it anyway, we might as well 
allow them to do it in an at least semi-accessible way.


&gt;<i> 3) The &quot;tab order&quot; should be up to the user. In Opera you can navigate 
</I>&gt;<i> in any direction you want using e.g. Shift+arrows, allowing you to 
</I>&gt;<i> freely navigate in tables for instance. The author shouldn't have any 
</I>&gt;<i> say about the tab order other than the source order.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> From what I've seen, most authors who use tabindex use it out of a cargo 
</I>&gt;<i> cultish habit thinking it would &quot;aid accessibility&quot; because some 
</I>&gt;<i> outdated accessibility guidelines told them so. The result mostly being 
</I>&gt;<i> reducing keyboard usability by distorting the tab order, because the 
</I>&gt;<i> elements with tabindex receive focus before anything else on the page. 
</I>&gt;<i> These authors don't realise how tabindex actually works, but they feel 
</I>&gt;<i> good about having added it because they comply with the accessibility 
</I>&gt;<i> guidelines, yet they don't know that it in fact screws up the tab order 
</I>&gt;<i> because they don't browse with the keyboard.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> It was pointed out on IRC that there might be valid use-cases for #2, 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. making a &lt;canvas&gt; focusable for games with keyboard controls. Then 
</I>&gt;<i> that's ok with me, I don't have strong opinions on this either way, I 
</I>&gt;<i> just think existing elements should be used where possible instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> reinventing links or checkboxes with &lt;span tabindex&gt; or similar.
</I>
Yup.


&gt;<i> However, for positive values of tabindex, I only see problems. The 
</I>&gt;<i> source order should be a powerful enough mechanism for authors to 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a tab order of elements. I would love to see browsers treat all 
</I>&gt;<i> positive values for tabindex as equivalent to 0 (i.e., just make it 
</I>&gt;<i> focusable but don't change the tab order). I would also like to propose 
</I>&gt;<i> that positive values for tabindex be disallowed in HTML5 documents. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it's a good idea to add a scoped tabindex feature (trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> address #1) as I proposed before.
</I>
I've allowed positive values, but I've allowed user agents to ignore them 
(supporting them is only a &quot;should&quot;).

That's one reason I didn't outlaw it altogether.

This seems reasonable.


&gt;<i> Shift+arrows are a completely separate issue from &quot;tab order&quot;.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> HTML5 can also recommend not adding these attributes gratuitously.
</I>
We could, I guess. Right now it doesn't give much author advice either 
way.


&gt;<i> Note that UAs do not even agree on what elements are focusable by 
</I>&gt;<i> default. In Safari, links and &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot;&gt; controls are not in 
</I>&gt;<i> the tab order, for instance, to match Macintosh UI conventions.
</I>
The spec caters for this.

Can &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot;&gt; controls be focused at all, on OS X?

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>
Would it be used often enough to matter?

(XBL has scoping, FWIW.)

People seem to disagree. :-)

These comments generally don't seem to cover custom widgets. Did you have 
any specific e-mails in mind?


&gt;<i> Tabindex is not a substitute for poorly organized documents, and at the 
</I>&gt;<i> end of the day, it's up to the UA to give the user final say on tab

</I>
I agree on the latter point.

Invalid values don't have this behaviour for consistency with IE.
