The new custom-* attributes are an attempt to address these requests.

The biggest problem for attributes with colons would be that scripts for 
legacy UAs (all of them today) would need to use getAttribute() with the 
colon (and the prefix would thus need to be hardcoded in the scripts, 
defeating the point of declaring namespaces), while scripts for new UAs 
would need to use getAttributeNS().
