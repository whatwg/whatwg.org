</I>&gt;<i> So right now, either you use a bubbling listener (capturing works too, 
</I>&gt;<i> although the web may end up dictating that that's a bug that won't be

</I>&gt;<i> to do the same thing as an &lt;event-source&gt; event, but maybe there's 
</I>&gt;<i> precedent here that I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell the event is dispatched at the document only 
</I>&gt;<i> because Opera's original implementation had postMessage on document.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of prefer dispatching to the window as well, but that change would 
</I>&gt;<i> have to be made ASAP to make Firefox 3.  It's a one-line change (+30ish 
</I>&gt;<i> for addEventListener calls in tests, also easy to do), as is the 
</I>&gt;<i> bubbling change, but it's extraordinarily late for us to make these 
</I>&gt;<i> changes (async cuts it very, very fine as-is), and nobody would be happy 
</I>&gt;<i> if the spec converged on something that Firefox 3 didn't actually

Changed to dispatch to the window.
