</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've now added window.open(), irrelevant=&quot;&quot;, and target=&quot;&quot; to the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hide the content you want to disable, and force the &quot;modal&quot; aspect of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the application to be responded to before reshowing the other parts.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that really the best way?
</I>
No, I meant everything within the one document, with &lt;section&gt;s for each 
part of the app, and all but the current &lt;section&gt; having irrelevant=&quot;&quot; 
set.


&gt;<i> Would that keep &quot;dialog&quot; on top of the main browser window until it's 
</I>&gt;<i> dismissed?
</I>
You should only use one browser window ever, as a Web app author.


&gt;<i> I used the WYSIWYG example because I think it's a good case where 
</I>&gt;<i> authors really want some sort of modal dialog that's synchronous in the 
</I>&gt;<i> opener document's javascript.  Is there a better way to handle that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also curious why the &quot;features&quot; argument of window.open is supposed 
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;have no effect&quot;.  That's something I can search the archives for on 
</I>&gt;<i> my own if it's been asked and answered.
</I>
Because none of the features that browsers support are things that 
actually should be supported, as they are not things that help the user.

Pretty much.

I don't know off hand of good resources on the matter, but this would be 
an interesting area to document.

</I>&gt;<i> Maybe modal elements (or modal forms) are already part of HTML5?

Well, we have disabled=&quot;&quot; and irrelevant=&quot;&quot;, what else were you thinking 
of?

Against my better judgement, I have specced out showModalDialog().

(We clearly need to spec it somewhere if everyone's going to be 
implementing it, otherwise we'll have an interop nightmare -- and indeed 
showModalDialog() works differently in all three browsers mentioned above. 
I figured HTML5 was the right place since showModalDialog() interacts 
directly with the navigation algorithm and browsing contexts, which are 
currently defined in HTML5.)

This is a first draft. It has issues, I'm sure. Let me know what I should 
fix...
