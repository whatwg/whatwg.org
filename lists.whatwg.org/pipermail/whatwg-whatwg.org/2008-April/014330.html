<PRE>(Apologies if the threading on this gets messed up.  I was not subscribed to
the list when the original message was sent.)

I want to paint Eric's scenario more strongly, because it seems like people
think if it would rarely blow up then it doesn't matter.

If you want to handle _any_ request sent by a synchronous postMessage, and
you aren't a cowboy programmer, you _must_ either call no functions, or use
a setTimeout() continuation.  You CANNOT know how deep your caller's stack
is, so you CANNOT safely do anything that could add to the stack depth.  It
doesn't matter if the stack will not _commonly_ be too deep, or if it isn't
too deep for the callers that you know about right now -- it might be too
deep at some point (after someone else changes the caller code, for
example), and your sync handler will blow up.  And the very sorts of things
you'd want postMessage for are frequently cases where others will write
mashups and use your code in ways you hadn't planned.  For this reason, I
think talking about &quot;the common case&quot; misses the point -- a sync API is
completely useless to anyone trying to write _any_ serious code defensively,
large app or small, because it cannot be made safe except by using
setTimeout to make it async, at which point synchronicity has bought you
nothing.  On the contrary, it has added great risk, because any coder who
fails to understand the threat posed here and fails to transform all
postMessage handlers into async ones risks his code blowing up.  I prefer
not to have APIs that force you to take action if you don't want to shoot
yourself in the head.

If you're still not convinced that coders would care, remember that stack
depths vary by interpreter, too.  I believe in pocket IE you have a
ridiculously small stack depth [12?].  On this kind of platform, the
recursion limits get hit in the common case rather than the uncommon, even
in today's code without postMessage().  While other mobile devices may be a
little more forgiving, smaller recursion limits are always going to be more
likely on embedded devices, and embedded devices are just going to get more
popular.

And as Eric mentioned, even on desktop browsers, apps of any reasonable size
(like gmail) already jump through hoops TODAY to avoid getting near any
stack limits.  This isn't some vague theoretical concern.  It's very real
and already impacts web apps.  So if we're trying to write APIs to enable
even more powerful, more robust web applications, sync postMessage
completely fails to accomplish that.

Below I have some less important replies to various points in Jeff's post.

</I>

Besides the comments I wrote above that amount to &quot;all the time, for all
large apps, and most small ones too, you will want async for safety&quot;:

I admit to spending more time in the C++ space than the JS space, but it
seems like in most cases where you'd actually want to call postMessage, you
don't really know how long the target may take to act on your request, and
you don't necessarily want to block.  The async use case seems more common
to me.

(Incidentally, I also find the name bizarre.  If it's a sync API, why not
&quot;callFunction&quot; or at the very least &quot;sendMessage&quot;, which [in Windows land]
doesn't imply asynchronicity the way &quot;postMessage&quot; does [in both the Windows
and common-english-usage senses of &quot;post&quot;].)

As you note, the workaround of immediately packaging up a setTimeout
&gt;<i> continuation isn't difficult. I tend to think worrying about the N-1 case is
</I>&gt;<i> designing a bit too much for the special cases, personally. Special cases
</I>&gt;<i> aren't special enough to break the rules.[0]
</I>

Again, ignoring my &quot;this isn't a special case&quot; comments:

Given the number of websites relying on this feature right now (0?), how do
you know what the special cases are?  I'm skeptical that async usage is so
exceptional as you seem to think.  Besides my own intuition above, the JS
developers at Google I've spoken to have all been surprised postMessage is
currently specified to be synchronous -- they were all expecting async.

setTimeout may not be terribly difficult, but if it's the common case, it
also forces the JS engine to jump through hoops that it doesn't need to for
no benefit, forces programmers to contort their app in ways that don't
express their intent as well, and is less obvious to someone newly
approaching the API.

Further, nothing says browser implementations must or will continue to
&gt;<i> enforce hard limits on recursion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nothing says they won't, either.  And when the status quo is that they do, I
will believe this restriction will disappear when I see it.

Even if, say, SpiderMonkey stops enforcing a recursion limit, so what?  If I
want my app to actually run everywhere, I need to assume the limit is
present until _every_ UA gets rid of it.  Surely you agree the chances of
that happening are small.  See my comments at top about mobile devices,
where these limits make lots of sense.

Making the API async basically requires the optional origin argument always
&gt;<i> be provided to postMessage, adding API complexity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't really see how making an optional argument be a non-optional
argument would result in a more complex API.  It doesn't raise the maximum
number of arguments to provide, and it reduces the number of forms the
function takes by one.  Furthermore, if a recipient needs to handle the
message asynchronously via setTimeout, they'll need this anyway.  Forcing
callers to provide it is a security win at that point, not a loss.

Or, if you like, take the position that the argument should stay optional,
and if someone for some reason doesn't have to care about security (?!),
they can avoid passing it.  Although I'm not sure this is a particularly
great idea :)

If some piece of JS is in flight, every client-side change it can detect
&gt;<i> *must* be one it has caused.
</I>

Are you sure?  I'm reading the docs in section 4.1.4, and it seems to say
that this is only true for changes within the unit of related browsing
contexts.  If it is possible to get a reference to a Window outside this
group, then your statement is untrue.  But I'm not sure whether that's
possible.
