<PRE>Hello.

I've been looking through the HTML5 working draft and I've been trying 
to find a reference for the use of the current PICS labels.

I noticed that the new specs only give three accepted keywords for the 
http-equiv attribute, which doesn't include the current &quot;pics-label&quot;:
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#http-equiv0">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#http-equiv0</A>

Being a custom attribute, it makes sense that you wouldn't want to 
promote this type of thing.

Having said that, I was searching within the new specs for a way of 
accurately describing one's content. I'm somewhat aware of the W3C 
POWDER WG and the only post that I could find that was recent and 
relative to this is here: 
<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2008Mar/0114.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2008Mar/0114.html</A>

The closest type of markup that comes close to describing content that 
is accepted with the HTML5 validator is the current ICRA label:
&lt;link rel=&quot;meta&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://yoursite.com/labels.xml">http://yoursite.com/labels.xml</A>&quot; 
type=&quot;application/rdf+xml&quot; title=&quot;ICRA labels&quot; /&gt;

My question is: what is the direction for describing the type of content 
you would have within the context of the HTML5 working draft?

Looking over the latest working draft, the closest I could see to where 
this might possibly be applicable is section 3.3.4 - Transparent content 
models. Would it be that you'd have markup right in the body that is 
considered transparent but describes the content on the page? Or, would 
you take something like the approach with the ICRA example above?

If anyone has insight into this, I'd certainly appreciate it.

Regards,
Marco Battilana
