<PRE>
I've made postMessage asynchronous, and have made its second argument 
required, with a magic value &quot;*&quot; to allow messages to be sent to any page.

I haven't made the API support sending data structures other than strings. 
I haven't changed the target of the event, it's still the Document object. 
This is a little odd, though, would people rather I made it the &lt;body&gt; 
element with an auto-forward to the Window object, like the 'load' event 
and so forth? That would allow onmessage=&quot;&quot; handles to be written.

I haven't introduced a new API for conversations yet, but at some future 
point I do intend to introduce something based on this spec:

   <A HREF="http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9">http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9</A>

I expect this will be introduced around the same time that worker threads 
are introduced, probably based on this spec:

Does that make much difference? Splitting a name from a value in a string

That makes sense, yes.

This is just a temporary problem, though.


&gt;<i> &gt; It seems that most messages will consist either of simple strings, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of complex data structures (objects). Reconstructing JS objects is not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a trivial operation; you have to worry about references into other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parts of the structure, getters and setters that hang or throw or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; return infinite arrays, functions, members that aren't enumerable, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc. I'd rather not go down that rat hole with v1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You'll have these problems with JSON too though, right? Whatever the 
</I>&gt;<i> rules are, we'll have to figure them out eventually.
</I>
Sure, but that's why my preference would be to just let the Web developers 
figure out their own protocols optimised for their needs.

That's a pretty compelling argument too.

Consistency with Win32 isn't a top priority. :-)

Sure, but then the developer could also simply execute any markup passed

That's not a security flaw in the platform, it's a security flaw in the 
page. If we start listing the ways authors can shoot themselves in the 
foot, the spec is going to baloon in size.

This is an open issue in the spec. I've noted your opinion that it should

The idea is that browsers should provide native JSON APIs, so that we 
don't have to make them postMessage-specific.

</I>
Indeed. This is a pretty serious issue. In order to not prevent future 
extension of the platform in this area, and in order to allow Microsoft to 
implement postMessage() cross-tab in IE8 today, I have changed it to be 
async.

dispatchEvent() doesn't go cross-origin, though.

What change can you cause to another Window that couldn't be buffered and 
wait until that Window had finished running script? The only thing I can 
think of that you can do is navigate the window, and that's instrinsically 
asynchronous already.

I think we can work around this without introducing new objects just by

This wouldn't resolve the problems with synchronous APIs raised earlier.

I understand that it would be difficult to change implementations at this 
stage, but it seems like it would be in IE8's best interests to be able to 
support postMessage() regardless of whether the target frame is in the 
same process or not. Certainly I would expect authors to be annoyed if it 
suddenly stopped working just because the browser decided to use another 
process for the target tab! :-)



I've snipped many very good and useful arguments debating the pros and 
cons of sync vs async, which I took into account but don't really have 
much to add to. There are good arguments on both sides. The argument that 
seems most compelling, though, is that a synchronous API blocks an avenue 
of future development for the Web, whereas asynchronous APIs don't.
