That has more to do with the fact that it wasn't supported in browsers 
used by 90+% of users for a number of years.

&gt;<i> So user agents need to learn how to recognize the good and the bad

</I>
Recognize and do what with it?

&gt;<i> Otherwise you have Gresham's Law: the bad documents will drive out the
</I>&gt;<i> good.
</I>
Perhaps you should clearly state your definitions of &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; in 
this case?  I'd also like to know, given those definitions, why it's bad 
for the &quot;bad&quot; documents to drive out the &quot;good&quot;, and how you think your 
proposal will prevent that from happening.

&gt;<i> If it has a preamble beginning with &quot;^&lt;?xml &quot; or a sensible
</I>&gt;<i> xhtml DOCTYPE declaration or a first element &quot;&lt;html xmlns=...&gt;&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> then handle it as xhtml unless and until it proves to be non-compliant
</I>&gt;<i> xhtml (e.g, not well-formed xml, unquoted attributes, munged handling
</I>&gt;<i> of xml namespaces, ...).  At the point it proves to be bad xhtml reload
</I>&gt;<i> it and treat it as &quot;regular&quot; html.
</I>
What's the benefit?  This seems to give the worst of both worlds, as 
well as a poor user experience.

&gt;<i> So most bogus xhtml will then be 1 or 2 seconds slower than good xhtml.
</I>&gt;<i> Astute content providers will notice that and then do something about it.
</I>&gt;<i> It provides a feedback mechanism for making the web become better.
</I>
In the meantime, it punishes the users for things outside their control 
by degrading their user experience.  It also provides a competitive 
advantage to UAs who ignore your proposal.

Sounds like an unstable equilibrium to me, even if attainable.
