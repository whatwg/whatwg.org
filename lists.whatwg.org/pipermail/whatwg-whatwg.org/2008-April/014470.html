<PRE>
HTML5 had a complex mechanism for cross-references using &lt;dfn&gt;, &lt;abbr&gt;, 
&lt;i&gt;, and so forth. I've removed it. It really didn't add much compared to 
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt; other than a whole lot of complexity, and there was very 
little demand for it really. I've also made the title=&quot;&quot; attribute on 
&lt;abbr&gt; required, and updated a bunch of examples.

Further comments and changes discussed below.

</I>
We don't know. They all contain the definition, though, which is what the 
spec said. That sentence has been changed to be a requirement now.

Why would that instance not use &lt;dfn&gt;?


&gt;<i> *Multiple Definitions for the Same Term*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happens if there are multiple definitions for the same 
</I>&gt;<i> abbreviation?  For example, if the same abbreviation has two different 
</I>&gt;<i> expansions given with two different meanings.  Which one would an &lt;abbr&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element without a title attribute be associated with?
</I>
Right now the spec doesn't associate anything together anymore. You need 
explicit &lt;a href&gt; links to make the associations.


&gt;<i> *Definitions with Links*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the dfn element contains a hyperlink, as in either:
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;dfn&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;dfn&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> it should be defined as being as a link to either the term's definition or
</I>&gt;<i> supplementary information about the term and/or its defintion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, a paragraph may contain a simple definition for the term with the
</I>&gt;<i> link to the Wikipedia entry for more information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;a
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot;</A>&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; is a semantic
</I>&gt;<i> language for marking up documents published on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
It seems like we'd want to allow, e.g., a link to a list of instances of 
the term.

I have defined the opposite, though (links to a &lt;dfn&gt; element are links 
from instances of that term).

Now that the cross-referencing is done just using &lt;a&gt;, yes.

You can't.


&gt;<i> If a document by another author contains 100 web pages, and &lt;DFN&gt;s 
</I>&gt;<i> contain no ID, then there is no way of creating an index of all the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;DFN&gt;s. I suppose that this is an extreme scenario, but what if the 
</I>&gt;<i> author doesn't create 100 web pages, and still decides to not use IDs? 
</I>&gt;<i> How do we link to it, if we write our own documents?
</I>
You can't, I guess. Ask the author to add IDs.


&gt;<i> Perhaps we should allow for something like: &lt;A 
</I>&gt;<i> HREF=&quot;mypage#'DHD'&gt;click&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A HREF=&quot;mypage#'dial home 
</I>&gt;<i> device'&gt;click&lt;/A&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem is that if we use IDs, then we end up replicating 
</I>&gt;<i> information. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;asdf asdf &lt;DFN ID=&quot;dialhomedevice&quot;&gt;&lt;ABBR TITLE=&quot;Dial Home 
</I>&gt;<i> Device&quot;&gt;DHD&lt;/ABBR&gt;&lt;/DFN&gt; QWER QER.&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We could use shorter IDs, but that doesn't change my point. If we do

</I>&gt;<i>

I agree with the idea, but I think the complexity is probably too high 
given the relatively low level of demand.

I think it's simpler to just have two links and be done with it. e.g.:

   &lt;p&gt;Teal'c activated the &lt;a href=&quot;#dhd&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a 
   href=&quot;dhd.jpeg&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

You would have written it as:

   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;dfn&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt; (Dial Home Device) is a..

   &lt;p&gt;Teal'c activated the &lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;...

That is, the &lt;abbr&gt; element could only have its expansion omitted if the 
abbreviation has been defined. Otherwise, the reader had no way to know 
what the abbreviation stands for.

At least, that's the theory... I guess one would have expect edthis to be 
ok too:

   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;dfn title=&quot;Dial Home Device&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt; (Dial Home 
   Device) is a..

   &lt;p&gt;Teal'c activated the &lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;...

...and would _not_ have expected this to be ok:

   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;dfn title=&quot;Dial Home Device&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt; is a...

   &lt;p&gt;Teal'c activated the &lt;abbr&gt;DHD&lt;/abbr&gt;...

...which is kind of a mess... I've removed the confusion here by simply 
requiring the title=&quot;&quot; attribute on &lt;abbr&gt;. The point of the element is to 
provide expansions for abbreviations, not to satisfy the compulsion needs 
of semanticists. :-)

Not sure which second sentence you mean, but for the record, you don't

Well, you shouldn't use &lt;abbr&gt; without defining what the abbreviation is.


&gt;<i> 2.

The middle one is the right one, if you insist on using &lt;abbr&gt; for this.

Either is fine, since i.e. is part of the english language now.

I don't really know what we're trying to solve here. The problem is people

</I>
Why? I would expect one to have to request the expansions when one wanted 
them. That's how visual users have to interact with &lt;abbr&gt;, too.


&gt;<i> I use &lt;abbr title=&quot;that is&quot;&gt;i.e.&lt;/abbr&gt; not just because that's what it 
</I>&gt;<i> means, but because that's how it *should* be expanded if it needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> expanded, for example if it is being read aloud. (Expanding it as &quot;id 
</I>&gt;<i> est&quot; would be pretentiously unreasonable.)
</I>
Why wouldn't you just read it &quot;eye-ee&quot;?


&gt;<i> Similarly in &quot;Mac &lt;abbr&gt;OS&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;abbr title=&quot;10&quot;&gt;X&lt;/abbr&gt;&quot;, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> give &quot;&lt;abbr&gt;OS&lt;/abbr&gt;&quot; a title=, because what &quot;OS&quot; stands for is never 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant in the context.
</I>
Why give it an &lt;abbr&gt; at all?

Right, speech synthesis has progressed enough that &lt;abbr&gt; isn't really 
going to be a huge help anyway; and it's more likely than not to be 
omitted when it's needed anyway.

I've actually removed this altogether. It didn't really seem compelling, 
and nobody seems to have tried implementing this experimentally anyway.

Removed that requirement.

&gt;<i> So. The proposal here is to replace the current xref design with a

</I>
To solve even more problems, I just made &lt;a href=&quot;#foo&quot;&gt; and id=foo the 
way to do cross-references. This has the advantage of working already...

If I recall correctly, rel=glossary was dropped on the principle that 
hardly anybody used it, UAs didn't show it, and users didn't care.
