Ah, ok. Well then good!

</I>
Right. I don't think anyone is suggesting that we need to classify &lt;cite&gt; 
elements in a globally unique and unambiguous way -- what would be the use 
case for that?


&gt;<i> However if &lt;cite&gt; were to have a type then it's likely that the first 
</I>&gt;<i> systems to take advantage of it would be search-engines and catalogues.
</I>
As someone who works for a search engine company, I highly doubt that. :-)


&gt;<i> Using a type/rel/category attribute instead of class will assist in 
</I>&gt;<i> automated document processing and categorisation. It doesn't really 
</I>&gt;<i> matter whether a list of allowed types is defined or not since a 
</I>&gt;<i> search/directory crawler would probably deal with the uncommon or 
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported exceptions. But lumping the type of citation in with the 
</I>&gt;<i> class names used to style it is simply asking for trouble since it will 
</I>&gt;<i> also trigger any defined styles (probably unintentionally) and/or create 
</I>&gt;<i> nonsense categories like &quot;book_class&quot; in the processors' DB. I could 
</I>&gt;<i> imagine such a situation leading to the following catalogue output:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This article contains:
</I>&gt;<i>     - 4 book citations
</I>&gt;<i>     - 2 book_class citations
</I>&gt;<i>     - 1 squiggly_underline citations
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope that makes my position on this clearer. If I misunderstood 
</I>&gt;<i> somebodies comments then I apologise.
</I>
I agree that class=&quot;&quot; won't work for this as a globally unique solution 
(short of a Microformat being developed for it). However, I don't think we 
need to find a globally unique solution, as the use cases for such a 
solution aren't especially compelling.
