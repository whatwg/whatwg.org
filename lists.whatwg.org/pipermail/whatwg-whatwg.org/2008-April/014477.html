 * Made _blank legal again.

I think this is an interesting idea, though I don't know how much demand 
there is for this. I would recommend following this up with the group 
documenting the NPAPI.

I'm not sure how we could spec something without referencing the plugin

Yeah, there's no clash the way the spec is defined now.

Why not just use &lt;iframe&gt;?

Indeed.

</I>
Yes, various suggestions along these lines have been made. I'm thinking 
maybe the best way forwards is to make the spec support these various 
proposals, but not implement any particular one proposal. (Similarly, Web 
Forms 2's repetition model, and HTML5's template model, should both 
probably be removed in favour of simply a supporting infrastructure that 
allows them to be implemented by script.)

We could probably do something that allows style to cascade into iframes 
from the same origin, which would address this.

CSS3 styling can presumably work around this:

   iframe { height: intrinsic; width: auto; overflow: hidden; }


&gt;<i> If you just need to modify a small part of your document like displaying

</I>&gt;<i> is a heavy and ugly solution.

At the moment, this is indeed true.


&gt;<i> It's why I thought about another way with a very small modification of 
</I>&gt;<i> the syntaxe of the target attribute : why not specify a dom id with a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;#&quot;, so it is easy to read and to understand. The &quot;#&quot; symbol mean id in

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The small html fragment can be a seperate static file, or contextual php

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div id=&quot;response&quot;&gt;The response is : &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;answer.php?question=something&amp;param=someparam&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> target=&quot;#response&quot;&gt;click!&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the response will arrive, css rules will apply to the new content,
</I>&gt;<i> and the result will be smart.
</I>
I think changes to &lt;iframe&gt; to support cascading into same-origin 
&lt;iframe&gt;s, and changes to CSS to support intrinsic sizing of same-origin 
iframes, would be far simpler.

This seems somewhat complex, and limited -- what if more than one page

I've changed the spec to make _blank legal but to also encourage browsers

The spec now encourages it, but we can hardly require it.


&gt;<i> Surely whether target=&quot;_blank&quot; or even target=&quot;help&quot; is treated

</I>
Actually the spec goes into some detail about what is required.


&gt;<i> That may not be appropriate for some environments, perhaps:

</I>&gt;<i> * terminal-based browsers, such as Lynx
</I>&gt;<i> * One Laptop Per Child UI, where everyting runs full-screen
</I>&gt;<i> * mobile phone browsers
</I>&gt;<i> * televisions with web access
</I>
I believe all of these are catered for.

Yes, one change (reusing the same window) would also require another 
(caching forms in session history). I'm ok with both of these! :-)

Where would you like such encouragements? I'm worried that the former will 
get lost easily, and that the second is basically impossible to implement 
reliably due to scripting (though Safari tries).
