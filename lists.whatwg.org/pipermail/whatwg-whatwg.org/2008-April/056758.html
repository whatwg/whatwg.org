<PRE>
I haven't added any new markup for footnotes or end notes. Side notes 
without callouts in the main flow are possible with &lt;aside&gt;.

For footnotes and end notes there have been a number of proposals, such 
as the following (and variants on them):

   text text &lt;footnote&gt; note note &lt;/footnote&gt; text text

   text text &lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; target=footnote&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; text text
   &lt;footnote id=fn1&gt; note note &lt;/footnote&gt;

   text text &lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=footnote&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; text text
   &lt;div id=fn1&gt; note note &lt;/div&gt;

   text text &lt;fn xref=fn1/&gt; text text
   &lt;footnote id=fn1&gt; note note &lt;/footnote&gt;

   text text &lt;ref to=fn1&gt;fallback&gt; text text
   &lt;footnote id=fn1&gt; note note &lt;/footnote&gt;

None of these are really compelling, in my opinion. None have the 
&quot;awesome&quot; factor that really makes it likely that UAs will ever implement 
them well. None are especially compellingly better than the currently 
available options:

   &lt;span title=&quot;note note&quot;&gt;text tex text text&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;text text&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;aside&gt; note note &lt;/aside&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;text text&lt;/p&gt;

   text text &lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;r1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; text text
   &lt;div id=fn1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#r1&quot;&gt;&uarr;&lt;/a&gt; note note &lt;/div&gt;

I have added a section showing examples of how to use these.

Having said that, here are more detailed comments in response to the 
feedback provided:

</I>&gt;<i> I'm all for a syntax for footnotes (and sidenotes, and endnotes). The

</I>&gt;<i> note and that you can refer to it if you want. This definition encompass 
</I>&gt;<i> a couple of methods to do such notes that are in use currently, in HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> and elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. One of them, mostly used with sidenotes, is to have the note directly 
</I>&gt;<i> in the text:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Some text &lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;this is a sidenote to put
</I>&gt;<i>     in the margin&lt;/span&gt; and some other text.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With pretty trivial CSS, you can then put all the sidenotes in the 
</I>&gt;<i> margin. With some javascript[1], you can also create a list of footnotes 
</I>&gt;<i> at the bottom of the page. This method is also consistent with how word 
</I>&gt;<i> processors treat footnotes: as distinct pieces of text inserted 
</I>&gt;<i> punctually at some place in the main text but which are rendered 
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  [1]: <A HREF="http://www.brandspankingnew.net/specials/footnote.html">http://www.brandspankingnew.net/specials/footnote.html</A>
</I>
With &lt;aside&gt;, you can do this, though not directly in a paragraph. If you 
use more markup, you can make this work today with fallback:

   &lt;p&gt;Some text &lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;this is a sidenote to 
   put in the margin&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and some other text.&lt;/p&gt;

It might require some tweaking, but you get the idea.


&gt;<i> 2. Some syntaxes meant to be written directly by humans, like Latex, 
</I>&gt;<i> also allow you to defer the note content until a later time to make 
</I>&gt;<i> things more readable. In these cases, you put a marker in the text, then 
</I>&gt;<i> associate the marker with the note content which can be placed elsewhere 
</I>&gt;<i> in the document. This make the text more readable. My own text-to-HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> tool (PHP Markdown Extra, semi-private beta version 1.1) use such a 
</I>&gt;<i> syntax:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Paragraph linked to a footnote[^1].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     [^1]: This is the footnote content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Some other paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not aware of anyone doing this for footnotes or sidenotes in HTML; 
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't seem very practical to style either.
</I>
You could do this with aside:

   &lt;p&gt;Paragraph linked to a footnote&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;r1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;aside id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#r1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;: This is the footnote 
   content.&lt;/aside&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Some other paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;


&gt;<i> 3. The last method of expressing footnotes in HTML is to create markers 
</I>&gt;<i> in the text and put the footnotes in an ordered list at the bottom of 
</I>&gt;<i> the page. For instance, my text-to-HTML tool generates this markup from 
</I>&gt;<i> the above example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Paragraph linked to a footnote
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Some other paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;hr /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;ol&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;p&gt;This is the footnote content.
</I>&gt;<i>           &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&#8617;&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/ol&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This provides a trivial way to style footnotes as footnote, it'll even 
</I>&gt;<i> looks good unstyled and is completely backward compatible.
</I>
Indeed. (Though I might quibble on the precise structure.)


&gt;<i> Before defining a markup for footnotes or sidenotes, I think it'd be a 
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to see what goals the syntax should fulfill. Is backward 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility one of them, or should we always rely on the browser 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities to relocate footnotes where they should be, or should we 
</I>&gt;<i> allow both?
</I>
Both seem good.


&gt;<i> Some other things to take into consideration:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Footnotes should probably not be allowed to escape their enclosing 
</I>&gt;<i> article element. For instance, if you have a couple of weblog articles 
</I>&gt;<i> on your main page, each article having some footnotes, it'd probably not 
</I>&gt;<i> be a good idea to have footnotes from all articles mixed together in the 
</I>&gt;<i> same list.
</I>
Makes sense. You'd want footnotes scoped to &lt;article&gt;, and end notes 
scoped to the nearest sectioning element, probably.


&gt;<i> * Although not necessarily very common, some people like to put multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraphs, lists, and some other block-level elements in footnotes and 
</I>&gt;<i> sidenotes (more often seen in sidenotes in books). I think it'd be a 
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to allow that in the markup.
</I>
Fair enough.


&gt;<i> * Sidenotes may not be achievable in the browsers's default stylesheet 
</I>&gt;<i> without adding a side margin. They could always be displayed as float, 
</I>&gt;<i> but it seems to me that footnotes would be the best fallback mechanism. 
</I>&gt;<i> Sidenotes are also impractical on small screens too. That's why I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe that, ideally, footnotes and sidenotes should share the same 
</I>&gt;<i> markup, styling is what should make the difference.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> I'm not yet proposing any markup, I want to start the discussion on what 
</I>&gt;<i> it should accomplish, and what is realistic.
</I>
I agree with your analysis. I'm not sure where to go from there, though.

That could be done from CSS, too.

Yeah. CSS will provide this kind of thing, but do we need markup to 
support it?


[Snip a discussion on how footnotes would be rendered in various UAs.]

On Tue, 31 Oct 2006, David Walbert wrote:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Sidenotes,&quot; though, is ambiguous. If the term refers to footnotes that 
</I>&gt;<i> happen to be placed beside the text, then yes, they're identical 
</I>&gt;<i> semantically to footnotes. But &quot;sidenotes&quot; may also refer to &quot;pull 
</I>&gt;<i> quotes&quot; or &quot;callouts&quot; -- some small piece of text to be highlighted 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than additional explanatory information of the sort that would 
</I>&gt;<i> appear in a sidebar or footnote. Or, if &quot;sidenote&quot; refers to what is 
</I>&gt;<i> usually called a &quot;sidebar,&quot; then we're talking about something that is 
</I>&gt;<i> both more extensive than the typical footnote and of greater importance 
</I>&gt;<i> relative to the main text -- its position on the side of the page is 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than at the bottom is not merely presentational but is indicative 
</I>&gt;<i> of the weight of the content. Moreover, a callout or sidebar is not a 
</I>&gt;<i> numbered or marked reference and need not be referred from a precise 
</I>&gt;<i> location within the text -- whereas a footnote or endnote relates to a 
</I>&gt;<i> specific word, sentence, or paragraph, a sidebar/callout/pullquote 
</I>&gt;<i> relates more vaguely to a more general section of text, or in the case 
</I>&gt;<i> of some sidebars, to the full article.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So while markup for footnotes/endnotes could be standardized fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> easily (in as much as writing standards is ever easy), I don't even know 
</I>&gt;<i> where I would begin to define sidenotes semantically. As I've used them 
</I>&gt;<i> in print and on the web, they'd need to relate to (1) a header, and 
</I>&gt;<i> therefore to the section of text underneath it; or (2) a paragraph, 
</I>&gt;<i> list, or other defined block of text. But a sidebar might need to 
</I>&gt;<i> contain block-level formatting (and even multiple paragraphs and 
</I>&gt;<i> potentially headers), which means it couldn't be placed inside one of 
</I>&gt;<i> those elements.
</I>
&lt;aside&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; are intended to address these use cases.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting. If I understand well, this CSS proposal would allow a note 
</I>&gt;<i> inserted in the middle of a paragraph to become a footnote. For instance 
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;This paragraph has a footnote&lt;footnote&gt;This is a footnote&lt;/
</I>&gt;<i>     footnote&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> could be presented like this (where 1 is presumably superscript and 
</I>&gt;<i> linked to the footnote):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This paragraph has a footnote1.
</I>&gt;<i>     ______________
</I>&gt;<i>     1.  This is a footnote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That'd very interesting. But the markup is poor for backward 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility and makes it difficult to include more than one paragraph 
</I>&gt;<i> in a note. So I'm going to propose an improvement to this markup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (For the next example: &lt;fn&gt; = footnote; &lt;fnref&gt; = footnote reference.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is needed to solve the backward compatibility problem is a second 
</I>&gt;<i> way of indirection, so that the footnote can be placed elsewhere. This 
</I>&gt;<i> is the first piece of the puzzle:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;This paragraph has a footnote&lt;fnref for=&quot;my-footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;/fnref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;fn id=&quot;my-footnote&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;p&gt;This footnote can contain block-level elements!&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/fn&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this example, a reference to the footnote is found in the paragraph, 
</I>&gt;<i> and the footnote content is elsewhere in the document. The browser would 
</I>&gt;<i> be in charge of numbering the marker correctly (or not, if the 
</I>&gt;<i> stylesheet says so) and to put the referenced footnote in a list with 
</I>&gt;<i> the other footnotes in the order they are reference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notice the empty content of &lt;fnref&gt;? That's substitution content for 
</I>&gt;<i> backward compatibility: if you put a link to the footnote within the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;fnref&gt; element, when displaying things as footnote the actual content 
</I>&gt;<i> is substituted by the marker, but footnote-unaware browsers will show 
</I>&gt;<i> the link. In the previous case, the fallback content for the reference 
</I>&gt;<i> marker could have been:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#my-footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since footnotes are referenced and reordered, you're free to place them 
</I>&gt;<i> wherever you want. If you care about backward compatibility, you should 
</I>&gt;<i> put them all together at the end of your article and there you have your 
</I>&gt;<i> list of footnotes. Footnotes without reference are considered to be 
</I>&gt;<i> referenced from where they are in the source. Or if you want them to be 
</I>&gt;<i> styled as sidenotes, just put the notes before or after the paragraph 
</I>&gt;<i> they relate to in the source, or even inline inside paragraphs (although 
</I>&gt;<i> inline footnotes should be restricted to inline content), and hide the 
</I>&gt;<i> marker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last piece of the backward compatibility puzzle is the &lt;fnl&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> (footnote list) element. This element is optional, but if present, 
</I>&gt;<i> preceding footnotes inside the same sectioning element will be relocated 
</I>&gt;<i> inside this element. &lt;fnl&gt; would be styled as an ordered list, and its 
</I>&gt;<i> list items would be footnote elements (&lt;fn&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;This paragraph has a footnote&lt;fnref for=&quot;my-footnote&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>        &gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#my-footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/fnref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;fnl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;fn id=&quot;my-footnote&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;p&gt;This footnote can contain block-level elements!&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/fn&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/fnl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest that footnotes be relocated at the end of the first &lt;article&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element, or to the first &lt;fnl&gt; element following them in the source. It 
</I>&gt;<i> goes without saying that footnotes already inside &lt;fnl&gt; stay where they 
</I>&gt;<i> are, although they should be reordered in the order they are referred to 
</I>&gt;<i> in the text.
</I>
At this point, why not simplify the markup and remove the &lt;fnref&gt;? And 
turn the &lt;fnl&gt; and &lt;fn&gt; into a &lt;section&gt; and some &lt;div&gt;s or something and 
you have backwards compatible markup that already does everything we need 
without sacrificing any of the stylability...

This seems even more complex...

Of course annotations bring in even more people with even more opinions

I think the CSS stuff is less of a big deal than you make it out to be, 
but I agree in general with those comments.

All good points.

Interesting articles.


&gt;<i> &gt; One thing to consider when looking at footnotes is &quot;would the title=&quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute handle this use case as well as what I'm proposing?&quot;. If the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;almost&quot;, then it's probably not a good idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduce the new feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't think so.  There are accessibility and usability issues with
</I>&gt;<i> the title attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Screen readers don't read the title attribute by default.
</I>&gt;<i> * Tooltips are inaccessible (in current implementations) to keyboard users,
</I>&gt;<i> they require hovering with a mouse.
</I>&gt;<i> * Users have no clear way of identifying which content has a tool tip, except
</I>&gt;<i> for maybe abbr and acronym (which get a dotted border in FF).
</I>&gt;<i> * It's also limited to plain text, when even the example from wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> contains additional markup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first 3 issues could possibly be addressed by changing the 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering, but how do you identify a regular title attribute from one 
</I>&gt;<i> intended to be a footnote?  Would it be appropriate for all of them to 
</I>&gt;<i> be treated as footnotes? I don't think so.
</I>
Wouldn't it?

That's mostly a CSS concern.

The mechanisms described can be used in this way (well, other than 
title=&quot;&quot;s inside title=&quot;&quot;s).


&gt;<i> When an author cannot got hold of a work herself, she must sometimes

&lt;cite&gt; is now defined to mean &quot;title of work&quot;.
