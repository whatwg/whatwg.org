Fixed.

</I>
It seems IE changed in IE10 and now acts like WebKit.


Arguments for the one-LocationProxy-per-WindowProxy behaviour:

 - it would likely improve Gecko's security story since it would simplify 
   Gecko's security invariants.

 - it's what Opera and old IEs implement (I think?).

Arguments for the one-Location-per-Window behaviour:

 - it would likely improve WebKit's security story since it would simplify
   Webkit's security checks (relative to the other option).

 - it's what WebKit and new IEs implement (I think?).

 - it has the clearer story for authors. Objects that change identity, or 
   that gain or lose properties when a page navigates, are unintuitive.

This problem exists regardless of whether we have proxies, since the 
Location object is visible cross-origin. Whether we proxy or not is 
orthogonal. The question is just how we should protect the object.

I do agree with this. I don't see why we would ever introduce an object 
like this if we can help it.

</I>
The Window object, the Document object, and the Location object, per spec, 
all have exactly the same security characteristics, except that Window and 
Location have certain properties that can be accessed. (This is also quite 
similar to the Storage model, except Storage uses the actual origin, not 
the effective script origin.)

I don't think making it one of those proxy objects, of which there's only 
one so far and it's very complicated, is making it &quot;just like any other 
object&quot;, but I understand that the Gecko security model does make this 
different than it first appears.


&gt;<i> Also, FWIW, from the perspective of an average web-developer, IMO it 
</I>&gt;<i> makes much more semantic sense to have one Location per WindowProxy if 
</I>&gt;<i> the Location object describes the WindowProxy.
</I>
It has some pretty serious implications. It means if you have the object 
in an iframe and install a shim to implement some of Anne's new features, 
your shim will break as soon as you navigate the iframe. That's very odd. 
It also means that the object's &quot;instanceof&quot; characteristic will keep 
changing. Again, very unusual and not something authors normally see.

</I>
Microsoft seems to have already changed, from what I hear of IE10 (I 
unfortunately don't have access to an instance to test for myself).

Input from Opera people would indeed be welcome.

Well, the proposal is that there's two Location objects, but 
window.location always returns an object that refers to the active 
document's one, right? Or is the proposal that there really only be one 
instance? If the latter, whose prototype does it have? I don't see how we 
could do the latter really.


&gt;<i> As for loc.foo, our new implementation would give &quot;B1&quot;, because the 
</I>&gt;<i> Location object has entirely transplanted into the new Document's scope. 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems sane to me, but it's certainly up for discussion.
</I>
I don't think it seems sane from the author's perspective.


For now I've tightened up the spec so it should be implementable, secure, 
and Web-compatible, but it still has a unique instance per Document, not 
the one-object-whose-prototype-keeps-changing model, nor the proxy model 
(it's not entirely clear to me which is being proposed for Gecko).

But more input on this is definitely welcome. I'm in particular curious 
about what authors would find most intuitive, about what Gecko's plans are 
regarding which Location interface object to use for the prototype of the 
Location object instance(s), whether the proposal would enable 
cross-origin shims (or indeed same-origin shims) on Location instances, 
etc. I'm also curious as to why figuring out the &quot;entry script&quot;'s 
characteristics needs to use the stack introspection rather than just 
having an event-loop global &quot;first script&quot; variable, much as the spec 
describes it -- the latter seems safer and more efficient to me. If the 
spec's description can't be implemented, then it's something that should 
be fixed.
