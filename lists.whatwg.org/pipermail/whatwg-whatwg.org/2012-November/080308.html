How does &quot;JavaScript work&quot; in your mind?  We have a good amount of 
experience making a non-symmetric model work in Gecko, for what it's worth.

&gt;<i> Any time you pass a string from one to the other, you're also passing a way for the
</I>&gt;<i> callee to call back into the caller, for example (via the string's
</I>&gt;<i> methods).
</I>
Spidermonkey effectively copies strings when passing across globals; the 
callee never gets the caller's actual string.  The methods the callee 
sees on strings are its own methods, not the callers.

&gt;<i> Passing any sort of structured objects similarly means passing
</I>&gt;<i> mehods.
</I>
In the case of Gecko, what the caller gets in this case is a proxy for 
the actual object which enforces security invariants like &quot;only 
properties on a whitelist are exposed&quot; for cases when the security check 
is asymmetric.  This is handled completely on the underlying JS 
implementation level; individual callers don't have to do anything 
special to be safe this way.

&gt;<i> We have mechanisms for safe passing of data from one context to another,
</I>&gt;<i> such as postMessage(). Doing it by having one-way glass in JS just seems
</I>&gt;<i> like asking for trouble.
</I>
postMessage doesn't work unless both sides are cooperating...

&gt;<i> Yeah, like running getters with the ability to abort them if they don't
</I>&gt;<i> return promptly.
</I>
Perhaps, yes.  ;)  I agree that debuggers have all sorts of weird going 
on, obviously!

&gt;<i> But your underlying point, that we can't rely on the entry script and the
</I>&gt;<i> real origin, is sound. In particular, anything that's to be affected by
</I>&gt;<i> document.domain has to use the calling script, not the entry script, and
</I>&gt;<i> has to use the effective origin, not the real origin. It would be useful
</I>&gt;<i> if someone (other than me) were to review the spec's uses of the term
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;entry script&quot; and &quot;origin&quot; and verify that the checks all make sense.
</I>
I'll see what I can do about finding someone for this.  Might be a few 
weeks given holidays and whatnot, obviously.

I'll let Bobby handle the Location parts of this.  ;)
