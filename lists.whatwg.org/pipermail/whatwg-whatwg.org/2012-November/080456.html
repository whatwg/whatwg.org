I and others have already made clear that I was misreading the Mozilla
source code.

I'm aware of the security implications of interpreting a resource as
something other than what the Content-Type header says. The whole
reason I sent the original e-mail was because I thought Mozilla was
sniffing &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; in a way that it shouldn't, and I
wanted to clarify whether there was something I was missing.

I think you need to tone down your worry about my changes to the spec.
If I didn't have concern for the security implications for a change, I
wouldn't be sending an e-mail to the list about them, would I?
