</I>&gt;<i>    script's global object.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the global object is the window the function came from.  So the spec doesn't seem to match any of the above three rendering engines.  Does it
</I>&gt;<i> match Trident?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ask because I'm worried about web compat here.  While I agree that what the spec says to do is the sensible thing (and in fact, I had accidentally
</I>&gt;<i> switched Gecko to doing what the spec says here as part of working on something else entirely), if none of the UAs do it then there may be web content
</I>&gt;<i> that relies on it not happening.  There are certainly tests in Mozilla's regression test suite that inadvertently rely on Gecko's current behavior...
</I>

First I thought the spec behavior would make more sense, but if the error is about executing something bound to
window A it would be quite surprising to get error event on window B.
But I don't feel strongly about this.
