We actually implement this. It's pretty off-topic for the thread at this
point, but I'd be happy to talk about it in a separate thread or on IRC if
you're interested. I'd also be interested to hear your thoughts about it.

Anyway, we're kind of getting away from the original topic here, which
&gt;<i> isn't fully resolved; Location.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what if, instead, we had one Location per Document, and it worked on
</I>&gt;<i> that Document (not the active document), with the security policy being

</I>&gt;<i> ever getting references to it, you only got references to a proxy that
</I>&gt;<i> acted on the active document's Location?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Wouldn't this effectively mean having a LocationProxy, just like
WindowProxy? I'm certainly all for it, and think that it makes things much
more sane, though I don't understand why this wouldn't &quot;propagate the
magic&quot; that Adam doesn't want to propagate. I might be misunderstanding you
though. Can you clarify?
