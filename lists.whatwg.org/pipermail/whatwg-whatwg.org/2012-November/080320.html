As said in my reply to &quot;Forms-related feedback&quot; thread, I think it is
weird to have stepDown() going up or stepUp() going down. Users should
understand that they can't go down if the down arrow isn't doing nothing.
FWIW, this is the behaviour Opera and Chrome UI's have. This is also the
behaviour stepUp() and stepDown() have in Gecko and Presto.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mostly I agree with Mounir here, but I'm curious about what you think

</I>&gt;<i> control isn't a numeric/date/time type. I could see an argument for

</I>&gt;<i> about doing that?) but for the latter case I don't really see any point 
</I>&gt;<i> doing anything but throw an exception, as Mounir suggested.
</I>
I also replied about the no value case in &quot;Forms-related feedback&quot;
thread. I believe it might be better to set the value to something. I'm
not sure which value should be used for that.

Cheers,
