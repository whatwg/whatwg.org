I share the same concerns as Charles and Maciej (see above).

Especially, even if there is an unspoofable UI that is clearly
recognised as part of the browser chrome, any malicious author would be
a click close from getting your credit card number information. If I
understand it correctly, it would be as easy as writing a &lt;form&gt; with
some &lt;input autocomplete=&quot;cc-{number,name,...}&quot;&gt; and then call
requestAutocomplete(). If the user press &quot;OK&quot;, the page will got those
information, right?
This might be the same security mechanism as geolocation but the outcome
would be so tempting that people might try way harder to get your credit
card information than your location.

In addition, I wonder how valid the use cases of this feature are.
Nowadays, I feel like most websites will, by default or trough opt-in,
save all information so when you come back, you do not have to enter
your address, credit card information and anything else. Seems like
those websites have solved the issue themselves.
I feel like the real use case is when a user wants to make custom with a
web site for the first time. It might be indeed harder to get a good
transformation ration if the user has to write all those information.
However, I doubt we should add such a scary feature for that use case.

Cheers,
