<PRE>The current UI implementations of Opera, iOS, and Chrome-Android spoil the
HTML standard. Web authors hardly have motivation to use type=datetime.
They can add 'UTC' text, and their code can append 'Z' to values easily.

I agree that the type names are not good.  People must think type=datetime
is a combination of type=date and type=time. It's not too late to rename
datetime-local to datetime because the number of type=datetime or
type=datetime-local in the Web is terribly smaller than the number of
type=date.

&gt;<i> 'date' and 'time' are both timezone agnostic types: you just set a time

&gt;<i> In addition of being more intuitive, it seems that a huge majority of

</I>&gt;<i> those are quite rare.
</I>
&gt;<i> Furthermore, there are currently two implementations for 'datetime' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'datetime-local' I can think of:
</I>&gt;<i> - Opera: 'datetime' is like 'datetime-local' except that there is a
</I>&gt;<i> greyed 'UTC' text next to the datetime picker;
</I>&gt;<i> - Chrome Android: 'datetime' is exactly like 'datetime-local'.
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't checked what is actually sent when the form is submitted by
</I>&gt;<i> those implementations.
</I>
&gt;<i> Last but not least, I have never seen any [good and simple] UI allowing
</I>&gt;<i> me to pick a date and time in a specific time zone. As far as I know,
</I>&gt;<i> there are no native UI for those things even on mobile where there are
</I>&gt;<i> UI for date and time pickers.
</I>
&gt;<i> As a conclusion, given the lack of good UI and good implementations, I
</I>&gt;<i> think we should change the behaviour of 'datetime' to match the
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour of 'datetime-local' so developers don't use the former and
</I>&gt;<i> falsely expect the behaviour of the later.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I would suggest that we remove 'datetime-local' from the
</I>&gt;<i> specifications. If later if find out that we really need a date-time
</I>&gt;<i> picker that is not timezone agnostic, we could add something. For the
</I>&gt;<i> moment, given the state of the implementations and the very tiny use
</I>&gt;<i> cases that could solve, I think having this type would hurt more than
</I>&gt;<i> help.
