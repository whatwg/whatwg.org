</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So we could define the autocomplete=&quot;&quot; field's value as follows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I've now specced this, with some minor changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My only high-level question is: Why did you choose to drop the proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aliases like &quot;city&quot; for &quot;locality&quot; and &quot;province&quot; for &quot;region&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The short answer is that I wanted to avoid redundant terms because aliases
</I>&gt;<i> tend to cause all kinds of issues (people set both because they don't know
</I>&gt;<i> which to use, or they set both thinking they're separate and they end up
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting, or they start long threads on mailing lists asking which one
</I>&gt;<i> is the most appropriate one...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did do quite some research to figure out which term to use. In the end,
</I>&gt;<i> mostly on Tantek's encouragement, I ended up picking the terms that are
</I>&gt;<i> the most inclusive and happen to be the terms used by vocabularies such as
</I>&gt;<i> those based on vCard, like hCard/adr.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While &quot;locality&quot; and &quot;region&quot; are probably the most technically correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terms -- they're certainly the best that I found while researching --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're not terms that I'd expect most web developers to be familiar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's true, certainly, but I think consistency with things like hCard
</I>&gt;<i> will somewhat mitigate that problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think including the proposed aliases allows for a more &quot;natural&quot; way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to express many site's forms; and I think that more natural/readable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source HTML code is a Good Thing&#8482;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the attraction of having redundant terms, but the cost is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty high (as described in the parenthetical above). I'm not sure it's
</I>&gt;<i> worth it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For &quot;provice&quot; and &quot;region&quot;, I think they're a wash. In the US, &quot;state&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> the familiar term; in the UK, &quot;county&quot;, in Switzerland, &quot;canton&quot;... each
</I>&gt;<i> place has their own, I don't think it really matters what term we use,
</I>&gt;<i> but supporting all of them would be highly confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;city&quot;, one problem specific to this value is that it encourages
</I>&gt;<i> authors to forget that many of their users aren't in cities at all. I wish
</I>&gt;<i> there was a better term than &quot;locality&quot;, though, I agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Otherwise, a bunch of minor typos and the like, all related to the parsing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithm and subsequent sections:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * In step 13.3, &quot;hint set&quot; should be &quot;hint tokens&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * It seems like step 13.6 should precede step 13.5.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * In step 14.3, &quot;hint set&quot; should be &quot;hint tokens&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * In step 14.3, &quot;contact&quot; should be &quot;mode&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * It seems like step 14.6 should precede step 14.5.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * In the paragraph beginning with &quot;Suppose a user agent knows of two phone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> numbers&quot;, there is a typo: &quot;pefilled&quot; -&gt; &quot;prefilled&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * In step 14.4, I think &quot;either is&quot; is more natural than &quot;either be&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fixed to &quot;will either be&quot;, which was the intent (I deleted too many words
</I>&gt;<i> when copy/pasting the previous block).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Step 18 is the last mention of the &quot;scope tokens&quot; data in the parsing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithm, as well as in the subsequent commentary.  What is the intended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function of the scope tokens -- should they be combined with the hint set,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or is there a separate notion of scope that should be invoked by the UA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when parsing this attribute?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wow, I totally dropped the scope thing on the floor. Oops. Fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * For terms like &quot;autofill hint set&quot;, should the spec use &quot;autocomplete&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than &quot;autofill&quot;, or is there an intentional distinction being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Autocomplete&quot; is the feature wherein the user types half of some piece of
</I>&gt;<i> data and the user agent provides the rest. &quot;Autofill&quot; is the feature
</I>&gt;<i> wherein the user selects from previously-provided data and the user agent
</I>&gt;<i> provides all the data based on that selection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that the HTML spec uses the &quot;autocomplete&quot; attribute to control
</I>&gt;<i> the autofill feature is a historical accident. It's similar to how the
</I>&gt;<i> feature for providing alternative style sheets is rel=&quot;alternate&quot;, even
</I>&gt;<i> though the word &quot;alternate&quot; is a non-sequitur in this context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So instead of &lt;input type=tel autocomplete=&quot;work tel&quot;&gt; you would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; just say &lt;input type=tel autocomplete=work&gt; (and would not be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to say &lt;input type=text autocomplete=&quot;work tel&quot;&gt;, which would be an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; inferior user experience when tel is given special behavior, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;input type=email autocomplete=&quot;work tel&quot;&gt;, which would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; inconsistent).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a little wary about adding more magic here, these attributes are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; already pretty complicated. See the autocomplete section's algorithms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and let me know if you still think we should do something along those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; lines. If it's something people are willing to implement, I wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; want to stand in the way; I agree that it has some good side-effects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (like making it impossible to have certain combinations).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I could also introduce some conformance requirements to make the bogus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; combinations non-conforming; currently I haven't made type=tel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; autocomplete=email non-conforming for instance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since the autocomplete type hints are just hints, I think it's ok to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leave this behavior undefined
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok. Currently the spec says that autocomplete=&quot;work&quot; should be treated the
</I>&gt;<i> same as autocomplete=&quot;on&quot;, which is basically &quot;do magic&quot; (i.e. undefined,
</I>&gt;<i> as you say).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I also don't see any problem with making such mismatches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-conforming, other than that makes the spec even longer/more verbose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not a completely trivial problem. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't added this [government ID numbers].
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I also haven't added:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - payment instrument type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - payment instrument start date
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  - payment instrument issue number (for Maestro)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I also haven't removed, as some people suggested, the three cc-name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; subfields.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm open to making all these changes, but figured I would get some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; more input on them first, in particular from Ilya who did the research
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to come up with the original set of fields.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have seen a relatively high number of Chrome bug reports requesting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better handling of (e.g. government) ID numbers.  One example: [
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=64433">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=64433</A> ].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The better handling requested there is just for Chrome to not do any
</I>&gt;<i> special handling. So no need to add anything to the spec for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be helpful to add these to the spec; though as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequent posters have noted, there's a lot of potential complexity in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how these should be represented.  This might fall under the broader
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class of &quot;identity&quot;-related fields, which I think merit their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> carefully thought out set of tokens. There was some work done on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginnings of such a specification -- see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity-inputs">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity-inputs</A> -- but my current understanding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that this is an area in need of further development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to add more things like this to the spec, but I don't know what
</I>&gt;<i> to add exactly. If there is a concrete description of what fields I should
</I>&gt;<i> add here, I'd be happy to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The payment instrument type is almost certainly appropriate to add -- it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is included on almost every website that I've encountered that includes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payment card fields.  It was an oversight on my part to omit it from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initial proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's redundant data, the credit card number itself says what type it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly, I don't know how to store the information. What values
</I>&gt;<i> should we be expecting here? If a site has radio buttons &quot;v&quot;, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;a&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and another has a &lt;select&gt; with &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;, and yet another has
</I>&gt;<i> three buttons which set a type=hidden with the values &quot;visa&quot;, &quot;mastercard&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;amex&quot;, how is the user agent to figure out what's going on? This
</I>&gt;<i> makes the magic needed around dates look positively easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The other two payment instrument field types I haven't encountered on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Web, as far as I can recall.  So, based on my data set accumulated while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working on Chrome Autofill, I'm ok with leaving these out of the spec for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now.  However, my experience is biased toward US websites; it's possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that these fields are more prominent internationally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did some more research and it seems start date and issue number are
</I>&gt;<i> specific to the old Switch and Solo cards (for a while branded Maestro,
</I>&gt;<i> though they weren't technically Maestro cards as the rest of the world
</I>&gt;<i> knows them). These seem to be obsolete now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The three cc-name subfields are split out surprisingly often on existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> websites.  I was initially opposed to including these in the spec; but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that data in support of them was overwhelming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've left these.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, I have gotten a request to include a field type for bank
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> account numbers, though I have only seen this info actually requested on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a small handful of extremely prominent (and generally trusted) websites:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Amazon, PayPal, and I think Google Wallet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any reason we shouldn't just treat bank accounts like just
</I>&gt;<i> another credit card, and use cc-number for these?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Several of us on the Chrome team have been thinking about the challenges
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of filling out long forms full of personal information. We've noticed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that site authors split up their forms across multiple pages to avoid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overwhelming their users with one single massive form [1]. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particularly bad on mobile where we've observed some popular retailers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> splitting their forms into six or more pages in an attempt to optimize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their flow for a small screen. This unfortunately defeats many of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantages of existing browser autocomplete.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In researching this we&#249;ve found that with a few changes built on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing HTML autocomplete spec [2] we can allow authors to recombine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their forms and enable browsers to provide more useful autocomplete.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) HTMLFormElement.prototype.requestAutocomplete()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Asks the user agent to asynchronously present a UI for performing full
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;form&gt; autocomplete using the already spec&#249;ed autocomplete attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [2] used in the form. In concept this is very similar to prompt()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> except the UA could provide a streamlined experience for filling in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information in large chunks. For example you could imagine choosing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shipping address from a drop down instead of presenting multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inputs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Simple event named &#252;autocomplete&#253;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This event is dispatched on the form element after the UI presented by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requestAutocomplete() is closed if the form validates after having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filled each input and firing all necessary input events like &#252;change&#253;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Simple event named &#252;autocompletecancel&#253;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This event is dispatched on the form if the UI is canceled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems reasonable. I recommend implementing it (without a prefix); if,
</I>&gt;<i> based on your implementation experience, other browser vendors want to
</I>&gt;<i> implement it, we would then add it to the spec.
</I>
Right now this functionality is implemented unprefixed in
WebKit/Chrome behind various compile/runtime flags.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting positive indications from a second browser vendor that they want
</I>&gt;<i> to implement this would be the next step towards getting this in the spec.
