We don't do that. Anything we could about that would only be partially
effective since a transform could be applied after the canvas has been
drawn into.

That is an interesting solution but it is still not 100% safe from the
&gt;<i> author's perspective, since there are still several use cases that could

</I>&gt;<i> contents were rendered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.

Given how 2d canvas currently works, I don't see any killer solution that
&gt;<i> would allow subpixel antialiased text without any caveats.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We could keep two copies of the canvas buffer: one rendered with subpixel
AA and one without, and use the latter for rendering if we think it might
be resampled. Of course, this isn't going to perform very well.

Are there precedents for exposing features with documented caveats?
&gt;<i> (excluding caveats that were discovered after the fact)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, and many of them have been extremely problematic, because Web authors
will ignore the caveats. However, it can be acceptable as long as the bad
behavior is well-defined and implemented consistently across browsers.

life as a ransom for many.&#8221; [Matthew 20:25-28]
