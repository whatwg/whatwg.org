</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're massively over-complicating what needs to be authored here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, with a Google search, just mark up everything up to the
</I>&gt;<i> id=&quot;main&quot; in a &lt;header&gt;, mark up the id=&quot;top_nav&quot; as a &lt;nav&gt;, and mark up
</I>&gt;<i> the id=&quot;foot&quot; in a &lt;footer&gt;, and what's left is the main content. (Note
</I>&gt;<i> that this does _not_ map to what the authors would have marked up using
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;main&gt;, as determined by looking at what they marked up with id=&quot;main&quot; --
</I>&gt;<i> that contains the navigation.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed. But what the authors have marked up as @id=main is not relevant for
this discussion - it's not what &lt;main&gt; tries to achieve. We need to look at
what is marked up with @role=main and that's a completely different element.

&quot;Google actually placed a @role=main on a different element, namely the one
that encapsulates all the search results.&quot; This is where the &lt;main&gt; should
be and that excludes all the columns on the right and left of the search
results.



&gt;<i> I don't know what you'd mark up on youtube.com because I don't know what
</I>&gt;<i> is the main content there.
</I>

The feedback that I get from blind users is: &quot;the main content is the video
and I can't find it&quot;.


&gt;<i> But marking up all the children of
</I>&gt;<i> id=&quot;body-container&quot; as &lt;header&gt; except the id=&quot;page-container&quot; child, and
</I>&gt;<i> marking the id=&quot;guide-container&quot; and first class=&quot;branded-page-v2-
</I>&gt;<i> secondary-col&quot; as &lt;aside&gt;, would make the stream in the middle be the
</I>&gt;<i> first &quot;main&quot; content, which is probably what the page author intended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually, no - see above.


&gt;<i> This again doesn't match what the author would likely use for &lt;main&gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> id=&quot;content&quot; -- which contains the second of those &lt;aside&gt;s currently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, the element with @id=content is also not the one that &lt;main&gt; should
contain - see above.


 Wikipedia already has role=main on the appropriate element, and all the
&gt;<i> stuff that isn't main (except the appeal) comes after that, so they're
</I>&gt;<i> fine either way, even without ARIA. Their &lt;div&gt;s map pretty directly to
</I>&gt;<i> the elements in HTML so that the algorithm I describe above would surface
</I>&gt;<i> the main content fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed - it's the simple case.


&gt;<i> I believe that none of the heuristic approaches work 100% of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. Nor would &lt;main&gt;.
</I>

When authored correctly or corrected after feedback from blind users, it
will work - and it will always work better than the heuristic approach. In
addition, there is a large enough blind community in the world to make sure
that where it doesn't work they will speak up to get it fixed. For that
reason, &lt;main&gt; is a hint that is always better than any heuristic approach,
in particular as accessibility tools do not support any heuristic
approaches.

Regards,
Silvia.
