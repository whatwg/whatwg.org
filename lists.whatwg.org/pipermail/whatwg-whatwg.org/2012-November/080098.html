To be clear, &quot;Opera&quot; didn't voice support for anything. Some people from 
Opera suggested that it seemed like a reasonable idea (I think it seems 
like a reasonable idea).

&gt;<i> Hixie's argument is, I think, that the use case that &lt;main&gt; is intended to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address is already possible by applying the Scooby-Doo algorithm, as James
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put it -- remove all elements that are not main content, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc., and you're left with the main content.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the Scooby-Doo algorithm is a heuristic that is not reliable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough in practice, since authors are likely to put stuff outside the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content that do not get filtered out by the algorithm, and vice versa.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Implementations that want to support a &quot;go to main content&quot; or &quot;highlight
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the main content&quot;, like Safari's Reader Mode, or whatever it's called, need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have various heuristics for detecting the main content, and is expected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to work even for pages that don't use any of the new elements. However, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think using &lt;main&gt; as a way to opt out of the heuristic works better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using &lt;aside&gt; to opt out of the heuristic. For instance, it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable to use &lt;aside&gt; for a pull-quote as part of the main content, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you don't want that to be excluded, but the Scooby-Doo algorithm does that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there is anyone besides from Hixie who objects to adding &lt;main&gt;, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be useful to hear it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This idea doesn't seem to address any pressing use-cases.
</I>
I think that finding the main content of a page has clear use cases. We 
can see examples of authors working around the lack of this feature in 
the platform every time they use a &quot;skip to main&quot; link, or (less 
commonly) aria role=main. I believe we also see browsers supporting 
role=main in their AT mapping, which suggests implementer interest in 
this approach since the solutions are functionally isomorphic (but with 
very different marketing and usability stories).

I think the argument that the Scooby Doo algorithm is deficient because 
it requires many elements of a page to be correctly marked up, compared 
to &lt;main&gt; which requires only a single element to get the same 
functional effect, has merit. The observation that having one element on 
a page marked &#8212; via class or id &#8212;  &quot;main&quot; is already a clear cowpath 
enhances the credibility of the suggested solution. On the other hand, I 
agree that now everyone heading down the cowpath was aiming for the same 
place; a &lt;div class=main&gt; wrapping the whole page, headers, footers, and 
all is clearly not the same as one that identifies the extent of the 
primary content. I don't know how these different uses stack up 
(apologies if it is in some research that I overlooked).

&gt;<i> I don't expect
</I>&gt;<i> authors to use it as intended consistently enough for it to be useful in
</I>&gt;<i> practice for things like Safari's Reader mode. You're stuck needing to use
</I>&gt;<i> something like the Scooby-Doo algorithm most of the time anyways.
</I>
I think Maciej commented on this. IIRC, he said that it wouldn't be good 
enough for reader mode alone, but might usefully provide an extra piece 
of data for the heuristics.

&gt;<i> I don't
</I>&gt;<i> outright object, but I think our time would be better spent on addressing
</I>&gt;<i> more pressing problems with the web platform.
</I>
I think that's a very weak argument. In fact, given the current 
landscape I would expect this to swallow more of the web standards 
communities' time if it is not adopted than if it is. But I don't think 
that's a strong argument in favour of adopting it either.
