</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; That was my opinion for a while, too, but I eventually decided it was

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you explain why you think it is necessary?  In WebKit, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WindowProxy is the only object that has this magic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As noted, the Location object is the only object whose security
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics don't match its scope. This requires a lot of extra goop in
</I>&gt;<i> our compartment-based security model, and the goop is brittle (recently
</I>&gt;<i> forcing us to release two out-of-band updates, 16.0.1 and 16.0.2). We've got
</I>&gt;<i> enough belt-and-suspenders code now that I'm not particularly worried, but I
</I>&gt;<i> still want to make Location just like any other object from a security
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If UAs were consistent or the spec matched reality, this would be a
</I>&gt;<i> different story. But given that we probably need to change the spec to
</I>&gt;<i> either the Trident/Presto model or the Gecko/WebKit model, I support the
</I>&gt;<i> former, because we've historically had problems implementing the latter
</I>&gt;<i> securely. Do you feel that it would be difficult to implement the former
</I>&gt;<i> securely in WebKit?
</I>
That depends on the questions I asked earlier.

&gt;<i> Also, FWIW, from the perspective of an average web-developer, IMO it makes
</I>&gt;<i> much more semantic sense to have one Location per WindowProxy if the
</I>&gt;<i> Location object describes the WindowProxy. But I doubt many people touch
</I>&gt;<i> this stuff in practice.
</I>
I don't think the average web developer will hit this case because it
depends on interacting with the Location object in an inactive
document.

&gt;&gt;<i> We don't want to move objects between scopes.  That causes many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security complications that we don't want to deal with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you able to just update references, like you do with WindowProxy?
</I>
That's the magic I don't want to proliferate.

&gt;<i> That's
</I>&gt;<i> essentially what we're doing. We actually create a new object in the new
</I>&gt;<i> scope and update all the old references to point to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you answer the questions in my previous email?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which ones? AFAICT Boris answered all of them except for the testcase thing
</I>&gt;<i> (which I answered). Did I miss some?
</I>
Maybe I didn't receive your email.  I gave some example code and asked
which values were printed:

---8&lt;---
Consider the following case:

== Document A ==
&lt;script&gt;
Object.prototype.foo = &quot;A1&quot;;
window.location.bar = &quot;A2&quot;;

function f() {
  var loc = window.location;
  print(loc.foo); // print is a magic function that lets me see this value
  print(loc.bar);
}
&lt;/script&gt;

== Document B ==
&lt;script&gt;
Object.prototype.foo = &quot;B1&quot;;
window.location.bar = &quot;B2&quot;;
&lt;/script&gt;

1) Document A is displayed in browsing context X.
2) Browsing context X is navigated and now displays document B.
3) Function f is called.

What values are printed?
