Per spec it's effectively async. More importantly, though, per spec the 
'load' event on the &lt;iframe&gt; is delayed by some stuff that the 'load' 
event _in_ the &lt;iframe&gt; isn't delayed by, e.g. readyState changes, 
pageshow is fired, and delayed printing steps are executed, between them.


&gt;<i> The code for firing the load event looks somewhat like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     if (!mEODForCurrentDocument) {
</I>&gt;<i>         mIsExecutingOnLoadHandler = true;
</I>&gt;<i>         // Fire onload here
</I>&gt;<i>         mIsExecutingOnLoadHandler = false;
</I>&gt;<i>         mEODForCurrentDocument = true;
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and the handling for document.open() sets mEODForCurrentDocument to 
</I>&gt;<i> false. Now what happens is we enter the above code for the normal load.  
</I>&gt;<i> We fire the onload handler, which does the open()/write()/close() thing.  
</I>&gt;<i> That tries to set mEODForCurrentDocument to false, but of course it's 
</I>&gt;<i> already false.  When close() happens, onload does NOT fire sync from the 
</I>&gt;<i> close() call, because there are still outstanding async tasks on the new 
</I>&gt;<i> document that block onload. So we unwind the stack to the code above, 
</I>&gt;<i> and set mEODForCurrentDocument to true, and block any further firing of 
</I>&gt;<i> onload for this document until another open() call happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fundamentally, that looks like a bug in the handling of 
</I>&gt;<i> mEODForCurrentDocument, really.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if either that bug were fixed or item #1 above were changed, I think 
</I>&gt;<i> you'd get two load events here in Gecko right now.
</I>
I haven't changed the spec to match Gecko here, since you seem open to 
changing Gecko. :-)

I wrote a similar test to the one you put in the bug:

   <A HREF="http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/onload/001.html">http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/onload/001.html</A>

It shows the onload handler actually getting called again in Gecko.

The interesting thing about the test in the bug is that it's actually the 
&lt;iframe&gt;'s onload that's not being called again, no page onload is being 
tested in that test. So for that test, the solution I suggested in comment 
10 in that bug is worthless.

Also interesting is that if you check what's actually going on, you'll 
find that in Opera and Gecko (and per spec) the iframe's onload is run 
asynchronously, whereas in WebKit it's synchronous.

That it's asynchronous means that what we need to do is:

 * in the iframe code that fires 'load', annotate the iframe's document so 
   that it knows we're in a 'load' event handler,
 * in the document.open() code, set a flag to true if the aforementioned
   annotation is set, and false otherwise,
 * in the iframe code that fires 'load', don't fire 'load' if the
   aforementioned flag is set.

Sibling frames:

Gecko and Opera go on to infinity there; WebKit blocks, but being 
synchronous means that the algorithm above would block this case, so that 
makes sense.

I've put the above suggestion in the bug, if nobody objects to it then 
I'll spec that.

Per spec they're about as consistent with each other as they can be, 
currently. (That's not to say that they're correctly specced; indeed 
there's an outstanding bug about making the &quot;abort&quot; steps work like the 
&quot;the end&quot; steps.)
