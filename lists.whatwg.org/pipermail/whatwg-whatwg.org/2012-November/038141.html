<PRE>The current HTML &lt;ruby&gt; markup has a few issues where it does not
properly solve the relevant use-cases.  In this email I'll outline
these problems, and suggest some simple fixes that maintain the
overall simplicity of the ruby model.

1. Inlining ruby
=============

The current ruby model explicitly uses a &quot;column-based&quot; model of ruby,
where runs of base text and ruby text must alternate in the markup, so
that ruby text is associated with the immediately preceding ruby base.

This does *not* work well for common ruby inlining cases.  For
example, the word Tokyo is written as &#26481;&#20140; in kanji and &#12392;&#12358;&#12365;&#12423;&#12358; in kana.
The base-text pairs are &#26481;-&#12392;&#12358; &#20140;-&#12365;&#12423;&#12358;, and the ruby markup must create
those associations accordingly. However, when rendered inline, the
correct rendering is &#26481;&#20140;(&#12392;&#12358;&#12365;&#12423;&#12358;) with the word kept together as one
unit, not &#26481;(&#12392;&#12358;)&#20140;(&#12365;&#12423;&#12358;).  The current ruby model in HTML, though,
requires that you either mark up the ruby correctly and get the latter
display, or incorrectly group the entire thing as one ruby text over
one ruby base to get the former display.

This is important, because inlining is not just a fallback measure for
down-level clients.  Inlining is often done as a legitimate stylistic
choice, such as when there's only a small amount of ruby in the text
(to avoid the increased line-height on the few lines that contain
ruby) or when the base text is already small (to avoid making the ruby
text unreadably small).

This can be solved easily by also allowing a &quot;row-based&quot; model, where
runs of &lt;rb&gt; elements can be followed by runs of &lt;rt&gt; elements, and
they're matched up index-wise.  If you can then switch back to &lt;rb&gt;,
you still retain the convenience of &quot;column-based&quot; when that's
sufficient.

2. Double-sided ruby
=================

When you want to create double-sided ruby, with the ruby text on both
sides of base text, the current HTML model posits two separate and
fairly different markup models.

In the first, when the group boundaries for both ruby text runs are
the same, it allows you to have two &lt;rt&gt;s following an &lt;rb&gt;, with the
obvious meaning.

In the second, when the group boundaries do *not* line up (in
particular, for the common case where one line of ruby is
per-character and the other is for the whole group, such as with a
pinyin and English translation), it requires you to nest two &lt;ruby&gt;
elements, with the inner one supplying the per-character annotations
and the outer supplying the whole-group ones.

Having to learn and use two different markup patterns for two nearly
identical use-cases is sub-optimal for authors.  It would be best if
they could just learn one model that works for both.

On the implementation side, this also requires two different layout
models for essentially the exact same thing.  This is unnecessarily
complicated; again, one simple way to get both would be preferred.

This is easy to address.  Add an &lt;rtc&gt; element (name taken from the
XHTML Ruby module), which is used for the second line of text.  You
can fill an &lt;rtc&gt; with &lt;rt&gt; elements, in which case they match up
index-wise with the preceding run of &lt;rb&gt; elements.  The last &lt;rt&gt;
(or, if no &lt;rt&gt;s were given at all, the naked text that was implicitly
wrapped in an &lt;rt&gt;) automatically spans the remaining bases in the
preceding run.

This makes both cases trivial.  If both runs of ruby are
per-character, you can just write:

&lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;FOO&lt;rb&gt;BAR&lt;rt&gt;baz1&lt;rt&gt;baz2&lt;rtc&gt;&lt;rt&gt;qux1&lt;rt&gt;qux2&lt;/ruby&gt;

Or, in the pure column-based model:

&lt;ruby&gt;FOO&lt;rt&gt;baz1&lt;rtc&gt;qux1&lt;rb&gt;BAR&lt;rt&gt;baz2&lt;rtc&gt;qux2&lt;/ruby&gt;

Alternately, if the second line of ruby text spans the entire group,
that's also trivial, and very simlar:

&lt;ruby&gt;&lt;rb&gt;FOO&lt;rb&gt;BAR&lt;rt&gt;baz1&lt;rt&gt;baz2&lt;rtc&gt;qux1 qux2&lt;/ruby&gt;

As you can see, the only difference is that the &lt;rtc&gt; contains a
single (implicit) &lt;rt&gt;, rather than two &lt;rt&gt;s.  It seems plainly
obviously that this is simpler for authors; it's also simpler for
implementors, because we don't have to infer that we should be
formatting something as double-ruby from the presence of nested &lt;ruby&gt;
elements.



Based on fantasai's research at
&lt;<A HREF="http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/ruby/#double">http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/ruby/#double</A>&gt; and her
subsequent conversations with i18n folks and CJK publishing experts,
these are the only two real failures of the current markup model.
These two simple changes would make the HTML side of ruby work great;
anything left (like jukugo ruby) can be handled fine by the CSS side
(when we rewrite the Ruby spec to not be sucky).
