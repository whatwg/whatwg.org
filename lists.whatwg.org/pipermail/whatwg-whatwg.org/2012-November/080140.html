The key questions. I've added some more comments...

&gt;<i> (1) If this API fills in a form completely based on stored data, and not  
</I>&gt;<i> by completing the user's typing, then it is &quot;autofill&quot; rather than  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;autocomplete&quot;.
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> (2) If this API provides the ability to get user information without  
</I>&gt;<i> even having a visible form, then it's not clear that it is even really  
</I>&gt;<i> autofill. It's just &quot;requestUserInformation()&quot; or something.
</I>
Right. It's like openly shared super-cookies...

&gt;<i> (3) This API has important privacy and even security considerations.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> You have to tell the user exactly what you are going to fill in to the
</I>&gt;<i> site before they approve.
</I>
And because as soon as you put it into the input field the site can use  
it, as a basic security measure it seems like you should never autofill  
without explicit user confirmation.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, most won't read it.
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;<i> If sites are asking for so much info that they have to split pages for
</I>&gt;<i> usability, then it seems likely the UI that tells the user what the
</I>&gt;<i> site is asking for will be impractical for most users to meaningfully
</I>&gt;<i> review.
</I>
Yes. This is a problem I face from time to time, and I think its  
seriousness is underestimated. This process can be used to collect all  
sorts of information before the user realises they didn't want to hand it  
over.

&gt;<i> This becomes especially dangerous if the mechanism can fill in credit
</I>&gt;<i> card info.
</I>
That assumes your most valuable info is about your credit card, which is  
only the case for a certain proportion of people.

&gt;<i> I would be very nervous if the browser could at any moment pop up a  
</I>&gt;<i> dialog that would submit all my credit card info to a dubious site if I  
</I>&gt;<i> slip and click the wrong button. Can you expand more on what thought you  
</I>&gt;<i> have given to the security considerations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (4) Should this API be limited to initiation during a user interaction?
</I>
Yes...

&gt;<i> That would reduce the ability of sites to spam the user with such forms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (5) What makes the UI unspoofable? Is that an important part of the  
</I>&gt;<i> security model?
</I>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Several of us on the Chrome team have been thinking about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> challenges of filling out long forms full of personal information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've noticed that site authors split up their forms across multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pages to avoid overwhelming their users with one single massive form
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1]. This is particularly bad on mobile where we've observed some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popular retailers splitting their forms into six or more pages in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempt to optimize their flow for a small screen. This unfortunately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defeats many of the advantages of existing browser autocomplete.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In researching this we&#8217;ve found that with a few changes built on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing HTML autocomplete spec [2] we can allow authors to recombine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their forms and enable browsers to provide more useful autocomplete.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) HTMLFormElement.prototype.requestAutocomplete()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Asks the user agent to asynchronously present a UI for performing full
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;form&gt; autocomplete using the already spec&#8217;ed autocomplete attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [2] used in the form. In concept this is very similar to prompt()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> except the UA could provide a streamlined experience for filling in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information in large chunks. For example you could imagine choosing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shipping address from a drop down instead of presenting multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inputs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Simple event named &#8220;autocomplete&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This event is dispatched on the form element after the UI presented by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requestAutocomplete() is closed if the form validates after having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filled each input and firing all necessary input events like &#8220;change&#8221;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Simple event named &#8220;autocompletecancel&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This event is dispatched on the form if the UI is canceled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using this API authors may simplify their input flows from forms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spread over multiple pages to just a few clicks on a single page all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while getting all the autocomplete goodness! Authors can also display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no forms at all to users of a browser who implements this proposal for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one click checkout experiences which are important on mobile devices.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The proposed additions also improve security on the web as users will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become accustomed to inputting their sensitive data through an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unspoofable UI that could warn users of phishing sites or even allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them to choose per domain security images.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We&#8217;d love to hear the thoughts of other implementers on this proposal.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1] ex. Retailers often split forms into credit card, billing address,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and shipping address pages.
