</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
This only makes sense if the control is a text control, which is not 
necessarily the ideal UI. For example, consider the GMail UI for typing 
e-mail addresses. What would you expose as the rawValue when the control 
contains two user chips, one word that is not yet converted to an e-mail 
address, and the user is dragging one of the chips to the end?


&gt;<i> * For number type, it returns user-editing string. If a user typed '123+++'
</I>&gt;<i> into a number field, rawValue would be '123+++' as is.
</I>
What if the number control is a spin dial and the user has the dial 
between numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;?


&gt;<i> * For date, datetime, datetime-local, month, time, week, the attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> returns a string in a field. If a field is text-editable, it should 
</I>&gt;<i> return user-editing string like email and number.  If a field has a 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed localized date/time string chosen by a date/time picker, the 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute should return the localized string.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> - We can enable text field selection APIs for email, number, and other 
</I>&gt;<i> types
</I>
How would this work when the control isn't a text control? I don't 
understand. For example, consider a date control that is actually three 
separate text fields (year month day); how do you envisage the selection 
API working and how would rawValue help with this?


&gt;<i> - JavaScript-based screen readers can read user-visible content of input 
</I>&gt;<i> fields.
</I>
Screen readers don't have to be limited to the HTML APIs. I'd expect a 
screen reader to have a much more intimate API to talk to the UA.


&gt;<i> Strings returned by rawValue attribute may be browser-dependent and 
</I>&gt;<i> locale-dependent. However it would be useful.
</I>
I think browser-dependent and locale-dependent APIs are a recipe for 
interoperability disaster.


I agree with the underlying use case of more detailed control over the 
widgets. But the way to fix that isn't to bolt on more and more 
browser-specific APIs to &lt;input&gt;, IMHO; the long-term fix is to implement 
a Web components model and allow the controls to be directly overridden.

</I>
I don't really understand the value in this. Why can't the page just get 
out of the way and let the browser and user work together?

Why does the page need to touch the selection?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this respect it's similar to the WebKit-proprietary x-webkit-speech

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it as an inputmode value, e.g. inputmode=&quot;speech&quot;. Possible the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inputmode=&quot;&quot; attribute in that case could be switched to a list of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tokens, so you could in fact do inputmode=&quot;latin-prose speech&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inputmode=&quot;numeric barcode&quot; in order to provide the user agent with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more flexibility in the UI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I agree that inputmode attribute should be made a space separated 
</I>&gt;<i> list of tokens, I'd avoid stuff like &quot;latin-prose&quot;. Expected input 
</I>&gt;<i> language should be specified via lang or xml:lang attributes instead.
</I>
&quot;Latin&quot; here doesn't refer to the language, but to the input method (e.g. 
QWERTY or QWERTZ keyboard as opposed to hiragana mode in Japan).


&gt;<i> Examples of somewhat sensible inputmode values for input type=text:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;unicode&quot; or &quot;text&quot;
</I>
This isn't &quot;sensible&quot; since it doesn't say whether a dual-label 
latin/hiragana keyboard should be in latin mode or hiragana mode or 
whether a dual-label numeric/alphabetic phone keypad should be in numeric 
or alphabetic mode.


&gt;<i> - &quot;numeric&quot; (prefer numeric input but allow any text)
</I>
That one is fine.


&gt;<i> - &quot;barcode&quot;
</I>
Barcode is borderline (and is the topic of this subthread). I could see 
having a barcode input method, e.g. on a phone the on-screen keyboard 
could be replaced by a viewfinder. However, this seems more theoretical 
than practical.


&gt;<i> - &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;voice&quot; (prefer voice input)
</I>
While I could see this being an explicit input method, in practice I think 
it's more likely that authors would prefer to switch their input device 
into this mode rather than focusing the control and finding themselves 
already in this mode. But it's borderline, like barcode.


&gt;<i> - &quot;word&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;sentence&quot;
</I>
Word with what kind of script? Sentence with what kind of script?


&gt;<i> - &quot;letters&quot; (e.g. &quot;letters voice&quot; means spell by letter)
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;ascii&quot; (prefer real 7 bit ascii over unicode text)
</I>
I don't understand how these would be used or why they're input methods 
rather than types or patterns.

I must admit that I don't really see the point of the capture=&quot;&quot; 
attribute. But in any case I don't think type=&quot;file&quot;-specific features 
should be overloaded onto type=&quot;text&quot;-specific features; that's just going 
to cause problems. Better to keep them separate.

</I>&gt;<i>   WebKit clears the invalid string when the field loses focus or the form

</I>&gt;<i>   Opera doesn't clear the invalid string. It silently submits a sanitized

</I>&gt;<i>   IE10 has a behavior similar to WebKit.  However if a user

Done (&quot;badInput&quot;).

Done, though I described it in a different way. (I hope it's equivalent.)


&gt;<i> [1] The only difference between Chrome's spin buttons behaviour and our

I'm open to doing that too; what would you preference be?
