</I>
Do you have an example of a game where lines are drawn using a line API 
without antialiasing, then scaled up? Most &quot;pixel art&quot; games I've seen 
tend to use bitmaps for that kind of thing.

This seems like something we should fix, not something we should work 
around by having people use canvas instead. Using canvas has all kinds of 
terrible side-effects, like reducing the likely accessibility of the page, 
making searcheability much worse, etc.

Also, do you have any metrics showing the magnitude of this problem on 
real-world sites that might consider using canvas instead?

</I>
Do we have any reason to believe the majority of authors would make the 
right decisions here?

(The main reason we haven't provided control over things like antialiasing 
is that many authors tend to make terribly bad decisions.) (Before anyone 
gets offended, by the way: that you are reading this almost guarantees 
that you are above average in terms of authoring ability.)

That's certainly true.

</I>
I haven't specified this; if other vendors intend to implement this let me 
know and I can spec it. I'm not sure it's worth it though.

Right. I'd really like to avoid adding more if we can help it.

</I>&gt;<i> I admit this is a complex solution for implementors, but it makes the

</I>
I think it'd be reasonable (for some definition of reasonable that 
relates to whether it's compatible with the spec, anyway) for implementors 
to do this today, without having to expose any control to the author.

</I>&gt;<i> aspect ratio would have to be taken into account for line drawing.
</I>
getImageDataHD() requires that the pixels be square, but so long as that 
is taken into consideration (e.g. by dropping down to square pixels if the 
author calls putImageDataHD()) I think this could probably be made to work 
within the spec's current requirements.


&gt;<i> Regarding the concerns about accessibility, I think the problem can be 
</I>&gt;<i> solved by using HitRegions with labels.
</I>
Oh it _can_ be solved. That's not the problem. Accessibility is not about 
what is _possible_, it's about what actually _is_. Most authors, 
realistically speaking, aren't goin to be using hit regions sufficiently 
for us to declare victory here.


&gt;<i> Come to think of it, there should be an option to make the UA do this 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically: create a HitRegion with a label every time text is drawn 
</I>&gt;<i> to a canvas.
</I>
I considered doing that, but it gets really fiddly when you're doing 
things like text that fades over multiple frames. In the end I decided 
that the magic wasn't worth it, as it would likely screw up more often 
than it would actually help.
