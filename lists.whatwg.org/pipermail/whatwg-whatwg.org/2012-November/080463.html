No idea. Adam?

Yeah, couldn't agree more. If you have any idea how I can improve this, by 
the way, let me know. I tried running HTML diff tools for a while, but 
couldn't find one that actually could handle a 5MB file, and in any case 
they didn't really make things any more readable than plain text diffs in 
practice.


&gt;<i> Sure.  We don't do any sort of &quot;tainting&quot; either, though; we simply 
</I>&gt;<i> remember the origin of the CSS (where it was actually loaded from, 
</I>&gt;<i> post-redirect, not the original URI) and do a same-origin check when you

</I>&gt;<i> effective script origin of the script doing the CSSOM access, which may 
</I>&gt;<i> not actually match the origin of the page the CSS is loaded for, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure whether the tainting setup you describe is equivalent to that, 
</I>&gt;<i> though I doubt it is.
</I>
The behaviour called &quot;tainting&quot; in this context in the spec just means 
&quot;treat as a cross-origin resource&quot; as opposed to &quot;treat as a network 
failure&quot;. The term comes from the first time I introduced crossorigin=&quot;&quot;, 
which was for &lt;img&gt;, where the default behaviour of cross-origin images as 
opposed to same-origin images is that they taint the canvas.
