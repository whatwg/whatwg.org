Then, maybe a better naming could be &quot;datetime-utc&quot;?

I feel like the main issue is that we disagree in which type is the most
used. I guess it highly depends on who you ask. I tend to book way more
often trains or flights than I arrange meetings.

&gt;<i> I agree that existing UIs are unfortunate, but they should be fixed. It

</I>
What do you think would be a good UI? Does something that would allow
selecting a date/time in the current user's TZ and then have the
information sent to the server in UTC would be a good UI?
But then, there would be no real difference between the &quot;datetime&quot; and
the &quot;datetime-foo&quot; widget, right?

If the main difference between &quot;datetime&quot; and &quot;datetime-foo&quot; is the
format of the value we send to the server, can't we simply always send
the timezone information? So, servers who care about the user's timezone
could do the conversion, and others could simply ignore the information.

Cheers,
