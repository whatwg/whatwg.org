</I>
Actually defer=&quot;&quot; defers to just before DOMContentLoaded, but &lt;script&gt; 
elements with a src=&quot;&quot; attribute that are inserted into the document 
dynamically will load between DOMContentLoaded and onload, so you can do 
all your important loading in the DOMContentLoaded handler.

You can use this pretty easily:

   function loadScript(url) {
     var script = document.createElement('script');
     script.src = url;
     document.appendChild(script);
   }
   load('mylibrary.js');
   load('myotherlibrary.js');

This can be trivially extended to, e.g., add IDs and support the script 
being inserted by inline script in specific places:

   function loadScript(url, id) {
     var script = document.createElement('script');
     script.src = url;
     script.id = id;
     var target = document.currentScript;
     target.parentNode.insertBefore(script, target.nextSibling);
   }

   &lt;!-- at the specific place you want this script --&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     loadScript('mylibrary.js', 'mylib');
   &lt;/script&gt;

The cost of parsing the script can be done async, even off the main thread 
in theory, so it's a non-issue. The only cost there could be is the cost 
of executing the script, and it's already trivial to offload that: just 
put all the code in a function, then call the function when you're ready.

</I>
It's not that it's not needed, it's that it's already possible. As far as 
I can tell, it adds nothing for performance.


&gt;<i> I'd personally be interested to see it implemented since people clearly

</I>&gt;<i> execute them in a certain order.
</I>
It's already possible now to design scripts such that they don't run until 
you call them, so you could already do this:

   // library1.js
   // depends on library2!
   function loadLibrary1() {
     // do everything to load library1
   }

   // library2.js
   function loadLibrary2() {
     // do everything to load library2
   }

   &lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;library1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;library2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     function loadLibraries() {
       loadLibrary2();
       loadLibrary1();
     }
   &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;body onload=&quot;loadLibraries()&quot;&gt;

With ES6 import statements, this presumably gets even easier.
