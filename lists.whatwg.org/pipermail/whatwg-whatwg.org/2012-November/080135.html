I am not representating a browser vendors either a browser developper
but I will be welcome to create a javascript polyfill
for the sortable table as defined by the WHATWG spec on the current
browser supported by the WxT Toolbox.

</I>
I agree to takes JS function &quot;callback&quot; similar to what JavaScript's
sort function takes. The callback function can receive the DOM cell
element as parameter.
Instead of alphanumeric order by default, it would more relevant to
have numeric sort then alpha sort. That sort can be base on the first
word in the
cell then if required goes to next words to complete the comparaison.

&gt;<i> 3. What elements does it go on? I don't see what it would do on a td. I
</I>&gt;<i> could see putting it on a th though.
</I>
Me also, I do not see the value added to apply sort on a td element.
Applying sort on th seem an interoperable solution with data table
that use the proper markup and are accessible.

&gt;<i> Also, it's not clear to me what would
</I>&gt;<i> get sorted. For example, in some tables, you would group trs inside tbodys
</I>&gt;<i> and want to sort those.
</I>
My opinion is that depends of the real scope of the &quot;th&quot; element.

If the &quot;th&quot; is an empty cell or used for &quot;layout&quot;, the sorting
functionality would not be available.
If the &quot;th&quot; is an &quot;group header&quot;, the sorting functionality would be
applied to the header cell along with their data fixed. Where the
header cell is a
subgroup header or/and an header that represent one or more row or column.
If the &quot;th&quot; is an &quot;header&quot;, the sorting functionality could be applied
to the data cell associated and by default the sorting action would be
extended to the other axis [row|col].

I think it is very important to always keep the data relationships
with their associated cell headers. This could be required, in the
accessibility manner,
for a screen reader.

I think the vector (col|tr) get sorted in their respective group where
the sort is occuring. No group (tbody &amp; colgroup) re-ordering should
happen during a
sorting applied on a cell header related to a vector (tr|col). A group
can get ordered only when the sorting action is applied to the group
header cell that
represent those group.

As the concept was already defined in a proposal I made
(<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-October/037679.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-October/037679.html</A>).
I would recommand that
the sort would not occur in vector (col|tr) into a summary group. But
the summary group would always follow their associated data group
during the grouping sorting.

Also currently there is no spec and/or official best practice on how
to get the full potential of the column grouping and the row grouping.
Before to enable any kind of official table sorting, the specification
should be able to handle properly the complex table relationships,
in an accessibility matter, without having the needs to take in
consideration the &quot;scope&quot; attribute and the &quot;headers&quot; attribute.
See the proposal to remove the headers and scope attribute:
<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-September/037475.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-September/037475.html</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Another obvious question: how does (or should) sorting interact with

</I>
May be the data cells that are rowspans and/or colspans could force
the column and/or row related to it to be fixed.
That would not break the cell relationships but could make the table
imposible to be sorted. Also when a sorting would affect
a rowspans/colspans cell, may be only the first cell value in the
sorting order can be considerated, the others cell would be ignored.

Use case: A data table that have row headers and column headers.
Row and column that is in the scope of an rowspans and colspans data
cell (td) would be fixed.

Use case: A data table that only have row headers.
Row that is in the scope of an rowspans data cell (td) would be fixed.

Use case: A data table that only have column headers.
Column that is in the scope of a colspans data cell (td) would be fixed.

</I>
I like the concept but that concept needs to be replicated to 'tbody',
'tr'. The same would be applicable to the group header cell defined
by the 'th' element.

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> The default &#8216;key&#8217; is &#8216;auto&#8217; for explicit columns and &#8216;none&#8217; for implicit columns.
</I>
I think the default 'key' should be also applied on implicit columns.

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Therefore columns should bear (&#8230;) what kind of content their cells have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Authors will mess this up of course, but then it&#8217;s their fault. Let&#8217;s not overload &#8216;title&#8217; or &#8216;abbr&#8217;.
</I>
By default, the sorting can be based on the inner text that the cell
have without considering any CSS effect and other Content Flow
elements.
eg.
&lt;table sortable&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;DDD&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;AAA&lt;/span&gt; HHH
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;BBB&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Could result like the following after ascending sorting applied to the
cell header &quot;Column&quot;
&lt;table sortable&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;AAA&lt;/span&gt; HHH
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;BBB&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;DDD&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

If the data cell 'td' has a specialized structured content then the
callback function would be useful to do the sorting.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Several columns may be used for sorting by some kind of priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a UI question, though.
</I>
Is there a use case for that ? If so, I think that should be
explicitly specified in the same place as the proposed 'key'
attribute.

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Cell content may not consist of the string that should be used verbatim (&#8230;).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Cells should have an optional attribute indicating their sort key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;th value=&quot;Rolling Stones, The&quot;&gt;The Rolling Stones
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;td value=&quot;0.454&quot;&gt;1 lb
</I>
I do not catch the value-add to have a 'value' attribute on th/td
element. That would just create duplication of the information already
contained in the cell. The use of an callback function can be a good
alternative to that issue. I do not see overloading the HTML code
as a best practice.


&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> To support this, cells must be splittable!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   td {color: green;}
</I>&gt;<i>   #split {color: red;}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3 &lt;td id=split colspan=2&gt; red
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 &lt;td&gt; green
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> after sorting by the first column should look like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 &lt;td id=split&gt; red
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 &lt;td&gt; green
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3 &lt;td id=split&gt; red
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> would if duplicate IDs were legal. The DOM tree, however, would not change! The value of the cell at position (1,1), i.e. second row and column since we count from zero, is always undefined, but the value of the slot at (1,1) changes from &#8220;red&#8221; to &#8220;green&#8221;.
</I>
That would break the tabular data integrety and the cells (data cell
and header cell) can loose their relationships.

&gt;<i> Once we have splittable cells, one could imagine additions to the CSS table model and Selectors that allowed arbitrary partial repositioning of slots, think 15-puzzle. Let&#8217;s not go there yet, and not here.
</I>
I do not have actual numbers, but my common sense and my experience
told me that the probability of an authors to create a puzzle from a
data table is
very very very LOW instead of having an author that would create a
complex table.

&gt;<i> User agents should not be required to sort tables that contain malformed slots,
</I>
I would say: User agents should not be required to sort tables that
contain malformed tabulars cells where the table width is inconsistant
between rows
and the height is inconsistant between columns.

A data table like this would be ignored because the second row are
missing a data cell in the second column

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column 1 &lt;th&gt;Column 2
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data 1
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data 1 &lt;td&gt;Data 2
&lt;/table&gt;

&gt;<i> There may be rows that should always go to the top or the bottom of their group. This should be handled by table headers and footers in most cases, otherwise it is not covered yet.
</I>

complex data cell.

As already proposed before, the data cell that have colspans and

and rowspans and still sortable.

&gt;<i> 6. Specifying how to display that a column is sorted. This would likely be

</I>&gt;<i> mad, obviously).
</I>
May instead of styling the data cell 'td' it would more relevant to

Knowing where the last
sort happened can be an useful information to be provided to users
that use a screen reader.

</I>
What is more usable, having default sort by being no case sensitivity
or with case sensitivity ? If the authors do not want the default case
sensitivity sort
he can use a javascript callback.

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> but there's no &lt;ol&gt; concept for &lt;tr&gt;s).

'ol' is an ordered list. 'ul' is an unordered list. Because this
discussion is about to add the sortable functionality to table, 'tr'
and 'col' needs to be
considerated unordered.

&gt;<i> 9. A commonly requested type of things to know how to automatically sort is

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> 13. What happens if a table has multiple &lt;tbody&gt; elements? Do they sort as

</I>&gt;<i> and ignores the rest, because multiple tbodies are uncommon, but that's not
</I>&gt;<i> really acceptable ;-)
</I>
The spec should take in consideration the grouping relationships as
proposed here: <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-September/037475.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-September/037475.html</A>

&gt;<i> 14. Fixed-position rows. Many authors have a &quot;totals&quot; row at the bottom of
</I>&gt;<i> their table which should remain at the bottom of the table even after
</I>&gt;<i> sorting, which is easily handled (that's what &lt;tfoot&gt; is for), but some
</I>&gt;<i> authors also have rows midway through the table which are &quot;headers&quot;: this
</I>&gt;<i> especially shows up in long tables, where the column headers from &lt;thead&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> are repeated midway down the table and should remain in position even when
</I>&gt;<i> the table is sorted. In general this means that they should remain the same
</I>&gt;<i> number of rows away from &lt;thead&gt;. This case is odd, and sorttable.js
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't handle it, but lots of people ask for it.
</I>
For me having midway &quot;headers&quot; used for columns could be an
accessibility/usability issue. Instead I see more relevant to have an
another option set on
the 'table' element to enable the posibility to keep the relevant
cells heading (columns and row group cell headers) in the available
view port.

It is important that cells would always keep their relationships
during the sort. So even the cell is split in slots during the sort,
those slots needs
to be rejoined as it was before the sort. That is to keep the
integrity of the tabular data.
