<PRE>You should look at the work going on in the WebPerf WG[1] which is
getting re-chartered right now.

&gt;<i> Hi all:
</I>&gt;<i> Recently we are digging into some performance issue related to our users' network, then we found we lack some methods to get required information about their network stats.
</I>&gt;<i> After some researches, we found a list of most frequently encountered issues:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. User's IP, when mapped to our IP-&gt;ISP library, got a wrong result, so we respond the user with a wrong server, which dramatically slows down the transfer speed.2. User has his own network broken, but didn't know where the issue is.3. User couldn't even give us a simple network connectivity information so we were unable to confirm the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> As of above 3 issues, we think we should request some network diagnostic methods to help identify theses issues, including:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A `nslookup` method which gives the DNS lookup result, so we could help dianose whether our user connects the fastest server.2. A `traceroute` method which help us discover which section was out of work we we could, for example, contact out ISP to quickly fix it.3. A `ping` method which simply shows the connectivity between user's device and our server, and speed sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i> With these API we are quite sure we could identify most network issues quickly and easily, but without them, we have to send user a client application which collects all these information and then send to our server, however this is not a best choice, since user may suspect that we were giving some malware (e.g. keyboard monitoring app).
</I>&gt;<i> And also, with these API, if users could allow us to collect network informations, we could continuously research these data, finding where / when we do not give a best connectivity, and then improve to render a better service to our users.
</I>&gt;<i> We know these API are very privacy-sensitive, so it should **display a confirm panel** to user first just like the Geolocation API, telling user which website it willl be testing.
