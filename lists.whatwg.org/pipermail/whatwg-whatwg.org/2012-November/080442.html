What's the contradiction?  We have set S = { types the user agent knows 
it cannot render }.  We have set T = S union { application/octet-stream }

What the above statements tell us so far is:

1)  T != S
2)  canPlayType(type) must return empty string for all types in T.

But later on in the resource selection algorithm there are certain 
actions taken for elements of S only.

&gt;<i> This seems to me to be unclear as to when sniffing of the audio/video

</I>
It's used for actually showing the video even if it's sent as 
application/octet-stream.

&gt;<i> I was grouping them together because they both rely on context clues

</I>
So first of all, &quot;sniffing&quot; and &quot;default handling&quot; are not the same 
thing at all.

But yes, context matters for determining default handling and also for 
determining sniffing.
