Ah. Does that work with older browsers (from the 2005 era onwards)?

Ack; thx.

I see.


&gt;<i> (Another dodgy part of this feature, from a conformance perspective, is 
</I>&gt;<i> the include files themselves. They seem to be in a proprietary format

</I>&gt;<i> handling any errors in the includes, and so forth. Also, the script 
</I>&gt;<i> completely ignores the Content-Type of these files.)
</I>
Yes. 


&gt;&gt;<i> It's been suggested &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/mnot/hinclude/issues/13">https://github.com/mnot/hinclude/issues/13</A>&gt; that a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data-* attribute on div could be used here, but reading the description 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there, I'm not so sure:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;[T]hese attributes are intended for use by the site's own scripts, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not a generic extension mechanism for publicly-usable metadata.&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hinclude is intended to be visible to software beyond the site's own 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What else is it intended to be used by?
</I>
Mumble. The intent was that browsers would be able to process it directly without the JS, and that (for example) search engine spiders would be able to recognise and process it (since it's uniquely identified by the namespace). However, that was in ~2005; now, it's obvious that JS is pretty much required for browsing, and search engines just use a headless browser. 

Some people might also want to process it server-side or in intermediaries (a la ESI - &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Side_Includes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Side_Includes</A>&gt;), which is used surprisingly often.


&gt;&gt;<i> So, what's the appropriate thing to do here? Keep on using hx:include 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (after all, it works)? use data-include or similar? Or?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Appropriate in what sense?
</I>

Well, it works now, so I'm happy to leave it as is. However, if there were an argument to move to a different syntax that improved interoperability / forward compatibility, I'd probably add a mode where it worked that way too.

Cheers,
