</I>&gt;<i> On the contrary, as a user I find that case extremely compelling.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm too easily frustrated, but it's intensely annoying when I
</I>&gt;<i> have to fill out all my personal information yet again just because
</I>&gt;<i> I've gone to some new site to buy something.  This is far harder on
</I>&gt;<i> mobile because typing is just a huge pain there and the screen is
</I>&gt;<i> small enough that I can only see a few fields at once.
</I>
I have noticed this as well: Several platforms seem to intentionally
make it harder to write text &#8211; mainly through removal of physical
keyboards, taking away pressure feedback and, to a lesser extent
modificator keys.

The proper solution is to let people vote with their wallet for devices
that are perceived as making input easier &#8211; not to hand over power to
site users making it easier to sniff data.

&gt;<i> It's already the case that Chrome can autofill my credit card number
</I>&gt;<i> into a form that asks for it, so I'm not totally sure why the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities here are viewed as new and scary.  It seems like we're
</I>&gt;<i> just trying to expose a slightly nicer event system for letting
</I>&gt;<i> authors interact with the existing UA feature set.
</I>
Looks like an is-ought-problem to me. The descriptive (&#8220;It's already
the case &#8230;&#8221;) can not tell us much about what should be done by virtue
of its existence alone. Did you use &#8222;new and scary&#8221; to imply opponents
appeal to tradition?

What Chrome can do is started by users; even then a warning is given:
&lt;<A HREF="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=142893">http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=142893</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> It's important that you use Autofill only on websites you trust, as
</I>&gt;<i> certain websites might try to capture your information in hidden or
</I>&gt;<i> hard-to-see fields.
</I>
Back to your text:

&gt;<i> I totally agree that we should think hard about privacy and security
</I>&gt;<i> issues with form autofilling.  It's just that I think we're already
</I>&gt;<i> in a world where we have to think about those concerns (indeed, have
</I>&gt;<i> been so for awhile), and the specific proposals here don't really
</I>&gt;<i> amount to a systematic difference in that respect.
</I>
The systematic difference &#8211; for me &#8211; is that the proposed functionality
may make easier to trick a user into agreeing to &#8222;autocomplete
everything&#8220; than the current functionality does.
