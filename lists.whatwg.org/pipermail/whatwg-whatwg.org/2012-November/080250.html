<PRE>Thanks Ian. So here's what confuses me, why is the bar so much higher for
traditional webapps than it is for browser extensions, chrome apps, native
apps, mobile apps or nearly anything else? Extensions, chrome apps, and
mobile apps have a consent experience, but it's hard to argue that users
are making an informed decision there and that the consent experience
really protects them. Native apps have no consent experience at all.

I guess I'm hoping you can point me to some guidelines you've developed or
which you agree with on where the limits of the web sandbox should be.  I'd
rather not force you to re-have a discussion I'm sure you've had far too
many times :-)

Regards,

-Dave
