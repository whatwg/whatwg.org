I don't think the spec needs to be giving suggestions for efficient  
implementation for live collections, because we inevitable won't implement  
exactly that algorithm anyway. It is a problem if the algorithm doesn't  
clearly map to some simpler higher-level behavior, as we certainly don't  
want to emulate some edge-cases just to follow the letter of the spec.

But, let's disregard the exact algorithm for a moment and only consider  
the actual requirement we're suggesting: &quot;any item which can reach itself  
by following itemrefs should be removed&quot;

It seems to me that it's quite possible to check this criteria while  
traversing using an algorithm of similar structure to what is already in  
the spec. One issue is that one must first find all the loopy items and  
then remove them in one step, rather than interleaving the  
checking/removing. However, it seems that this could be solved by simply  
flagging them instead of actually removing them, so that they will still  
take part in later loop-checks.

Am I missing something significant about the spec'd algorithm that would  
make it more efficient than the above?

If we just go ahead and show an efficient (enough) implementation of loop  
removal using the suggested criteria, I assume that would be convincing  
enough? Or do you really think that itemref is useless and complicated  
enough that it would be better to throw it overboard?
