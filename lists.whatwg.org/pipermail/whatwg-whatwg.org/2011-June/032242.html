<PRE>Hi,

my name is Rob Manson and I'm one of the co-founders of
<A HREF="http://ARStandards.org">http://ARStandards.org</A> and an Invited Expert on the W3C Points of
Interest Working Group <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2010/POI/">http://www.w3.org/2010/POI/</A>

I've recently published an outline for a web standards based model for
AR that is obviously closely related to all the work going on at the
whatwg.  So I thought I'd send this off to this list looking for
feedback and constructive criticism.

<A HREF="http://robman.com.au/a-web-standards-based-model-for-ar-in">http://robman.com.au/a-web-standards-based-model-for-ar-in</A>

Obviously some of the test elements are based on APIs that are still
forming or are not yet widely adopted.  I'm ok with that 8)

In fact I'm hoping that by raising this as a &quot;big hairy audacious goal&quot;
that we can use it as a thought experiment to validate some of the plans
for these APIs as they evolve (e.g Audio Data vs Web Audio and WebRTC).

I think the functional needs for AR are very clear and they introduce
some unique and exciting new use cases for API developers to take into
account.

So, I'd really appreciate any comments you have...both positive and
negative.  Currently we're working on breaking each of the test elements
out into wiki pages so people can contribute to the discussion and
development of each of these.  We'll also put the test onto github, etc.
too.

We're also looking for some great demos to include.  We need a
multitouch friendly js game if you know of one.  And the gyro and motion
examples obviously haven't been plugged in yet.  Plus none of the
browsers in the wild really support the required audio and video APIs
yet.

I'll look forward to hearing what you think...
