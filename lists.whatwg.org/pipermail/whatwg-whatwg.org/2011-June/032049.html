Since the CSS working group is actively working on CSS, it would be rahter 
inappropriate for us to do something like that. As Dave says above, I 
would encourage you to engage with the working group directly.

I do agree that it'd be nice if the CSS specs could be rewritten in the 
style we've used for HTML, though, but that would be a huge amount of work 
and I don't know anyone who has the bandwidth to do it.
