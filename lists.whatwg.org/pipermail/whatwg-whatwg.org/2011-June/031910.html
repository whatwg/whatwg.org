As a matter of fact, it does. It takes some work, and quite a bit of
creativity with ModRewrite or similar tools, but is perfectly
achievable. The key is to do the redirection _before_ starting to
generate the data, and to keep enough information on the final URI to
recover the parameters once the script actually gets into
data-generation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In short, I think that responding with a 2xx code _and_ attempting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change what's essentially part of the URI through other means is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contradiction
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;filename to save the data as&quot; is not &quot;part of the URI&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Think a URI like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;<A HREF="http://mysite.org/generate_progress_report.php?quarter=Q12010">http://mysite.org/generate_progress_report.php?quarter=Q12010</A>
</I>Wouldn't that default (in the absence of a Content-disposition) to
&quot;generate_progress_report.php&quot; as the filename? That's what I meant by
&quot;part of the URI&quot;.

&gt;<i> When saving, it would be good to use something like &quot;Progress report of Q1
</I>&gt;<i> 2010&quot; as the filename. &#160;But that's not &quot;part of the URI&quot; in any sense.
</I>It would, if the author wanted it to be. Turning that URI into
something like &quot;<A HREF="http://mysite.org/ProgressReport_Q1_2010">http://mysite.org/ProgressReport_Q1_2010</A>&quot;, for example
(that's what I'd probably do in that scenario) is quite simple to
achieve. A literal URI like <A HREF="http://mysite.org/Progress">http://mysite.org/Progress</A> report of Q1
2010&quot; would take some extra work to get working right, but is still
doable.

After all, if the author cares about having a reasonable filename, why
wouldn't they care about having a descriptive URI? The filename option
on Content-Disposition headers is just a partial solution to a problem
for which a more powerful solution already exists.

&gt;<i> Note that some browsers will do weird parsing of the query params to attempt
</I>&gt;<i> to extract a &quot;useful filename&quot;. &#160;That seems strictly worse than just using
</I>&gt;<i> Content-Disposition.
</I>Not on my sites :P My URIs are a &quot;useful filename&quot; by themselves.

&gt;&gt;<i> and thus a mistake on the best case, or some attempt to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fool the browser into doing something it shouldn't do on the worst
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly disagree. &#160;I think browsers that use the Content-Disposition
</I>&gt;<i> filename for &quot;attachment&quot; but not &quot;inline&quot; are just buggy and should be
</I>&gt;<i> fixed.
</I>Ok, maybe I used a too harsh wording for that, but for all the
situations I can think of where a filename argument would make sense I
can achieve a better result through URI beautification. I still think
it's a mistake to try to fix a &quot;filename&quot; but not fix the URI. The
&quot;attempt to fool the browser&quot; part was more about evil sites serving
files with names like &quot;hotnudepic.jpg.exe&quot; (I have seen real sites in
the past doing thinks like that, and even worse).
In any case, note that my comment was about what *authors* should do.
Browsers will attempt to do whatever is good for the users, and I'm ok
with that.

&gt;<i> Of course it sounds like your position is that they should not use the
</I>&gt;<i> filename for &quot;attachment&quot; either... (in which case you disagree not only
</I>&gt;<i> with me, but with most of the web).
</I>Actually, my position is more like &quot;I don't care what the browser does
with this because I have no need to use it&quot;. Honestly, I hadn't looked
into the filename option of that header until the discussions about
adding this feature to links and/or data: URIs started. data: URIs, by
their very own nature, are not suited for beautification. And even if
this feature gets implemented, the filename part doesn't concern me
too much, since it's just a mere convenience, and the user always has
the final say on what the file name will be (even if a browser didn't
allow changing that, the user could rename the file afterwards).

Eduard Pascual
