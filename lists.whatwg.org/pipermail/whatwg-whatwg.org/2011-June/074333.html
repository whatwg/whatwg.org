The word &quot;paragraph&quot; is ambiguous, as he current wording says indirectly 
but clearly: It defines &quot;The p element represents a paragraph&quot;, but the 
word &quot;paragraph&quot; links to the following:

&quot;The term paragraph as defined in this section is distinct from (though 
related to) the p element defined later. The paragraph concept defined 
here is used to describe how to interpret documents.

A paragraph is typically a run of phrasing content that forms a block of 
text with one or more sentences that discuss a particular topic, as in 
typography, but can also be used for more general thematic grouping. For 
instance, an address is also a paragraph, as is a part of a form, a 
byline, or a stanza in a poem.&quot;

So it says that p is a paragraph, linking to an explanation that says 
paragraph is different from p. The explanation mentions &quot;the term 
paragraph as defined in this section&quot;, but it does not give a definition 
- a sentence that begins with &quot;A paragraph is typically&quot; is a prelude to 
a definition, not a definition.

I gather that &quot;The p element represents a paragraph&quot; more or less means 
&quot;the p element denotes a block of text&quot;. Can you make this more 
explicit, please? This is very confusing even to people who regularly 
read specifications for breakfast. In the current wordings, there are 
_two_ dimensions of vagueness of &quot;paragraph&quot;: whether it is the 
classical concept of text that discusses one topic or the layout concept 
roughly corresponding to the old HTML block concept; and whether it is 
about explicitly marked-up elements (&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;) or more generally about 
constructs whose &quot;paragraphness&quot; might be inferred by some rules.

It would probably be best to dispense with the word &quot;paragraph&quot;, as many 
people can't avoid thinking that paragraph is something logical, not the 
layout concept of a block of text. Nut unfortunately, in HTML heritage, 
the p element is not _purely_ a block of text. In addition to the name 
and old descriptions, it associates with the logical concept of 
paragraph, since p elements have default top and bottom margins. So they 
differ from div elements. A div element containing only text can be 
characterized as a block of text, and so can a p element, but there's a 
difference.

Maybe something like the following might express this:

The p element represents a block of text so that consecutive p elements 
are regarded as topically distinct. The name p comes from &quot;paragraph&quot;, 
and the p element typically corresponds to a paragraph in prose, i.e. a 
subdivision of text that deals with one point or gives the words of one 
speaker in a discussion. However, the p element is also used for other 
thematic grouping, for example for a byline, a mailing address, for a 
label and associated field in a form, for a byline, or for a stanza in a 
poem.

Visual browsers are expected to render p elements by default with empty 
lines before and after, caused by default top and bottom margin.

&gt;&gt;<i> a) for styling purposes (you need a container element so that you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specify, without clumsily using classes on both the P and the UL, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that vertical spacing be reduced or zero)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;  handles this case:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;div&gt;This sentence
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;ol&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;li&gt;contains
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;li&gt;a list
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;/ol&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     ...and is made of four paragraphs but can be styled as one since the
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;div&gt;  element is used instead of&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
</I>
But if this follows, for example, a table, then extra measures would be 
needed to create vertical spacing. Using the p element would make the 
spacing the default. Similarly for spacing after this construct. So it 
would be more robust to use &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; markup here. Or you would need to 
assign style properties to the div element, effectively making it 
formatted the same way as p elements normally are, in your document.

I don't think anonymous blocks of text are a good idea. There was a 
reason why they were frowned upon in HTML 4.01. After years of favoring 
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; as a container, as opposite to the original idea that allowed 
&lt;p&gt; as an empty element indicating paragraph break, it seems odd to give 
so many examples with &quot;loose&quot; text.

So I hope an example like the above but with &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; markup can be 
added, to answer the common question (which is often formulated in terms 
of a &quot;list header&quot;, but it's really about something that starts as a 
paragraph and then moves to listing things down as a bulleted list).

Maybe an explanation like this might be added (perhaps even after the 
definition of p, as it really clarifies the concept):

Within a p element, only phrasing content (previously called 
&quot;text-level&quot; content) is allowed. This implies that it cannot contain a 
list element or a table element for example. A part of a document that 
discusses one topic is normally marked up as one p element, but if it 
contains lists for example, it needs to be marked up as one more p 
elements intermixed with (not containing) one or more lists. The part 
may be marked up as a div element to group the elements for the purposes 
of styling and scripting, for example

&lt;div class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is text, which may be just list header (introduction to
the list) or a longer presentation.
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;an item&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;another item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we may have text that logically continues the discussion
of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* * *

I know this suggestion is long and raw, but I hope its basic content is 
something we can agree on. And I have no big problem with using div 
markup here, even though it somewhat goes against the spirit of modern HTML.
