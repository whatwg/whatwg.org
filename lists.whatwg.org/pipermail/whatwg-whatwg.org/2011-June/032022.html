</I>
It should put it up in the context of the top-level browsing context of 
the script that led to that point (the &quot;first script&quot;). This is the same 
as if someone in one tab calls another tab's script and that script calls 
alert().

Note that only direct script invokations would work here. setTimeout, 
events, XHR callbacks, etc, don't run while the document is not active. (I 
had previously set that dispatchEvent() would work, but this is incorrect 
per the spec at the moment. My apologies.)


&gt;<i> There are quite a few APIs that need to be thus audited if this

Are there any I should look for off-hand?


&gt;<i> &gt; It certainly seems like there are some valid use cases for moving

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are, yes.  There are also lots of edge cases that are otherwise 
</I>&gt;<i> impossible that are introduced by allowing it; I'm a little curious as 
</I>&gt;<i> to how compatible with each other the IE8 and Chrome implementations 
</I>&gt;<i> are.
</I>
I agree that this is an area that might well be minimally interoperable at 
the moment. That, of course, is the main reason to specify it. :-)
