For commercial video providers, the tracks in a live stream change all
the time; this is not limited to audio and video tracks but would include
text tracks as well.

OK, all this indicates to me that we probably want a &quot;metadatachanged&quot;
event to indicate there has been a change and that JS may need to
check some of its assumptions.

We already have durationchange. Duration is metadata. If we want to support
changes to width/height, and the script is interested in when that happens,
maybe there should be a dimensionchange event (but what's the use case for
changing width/height mid-stream?). Does the spec support changes to text
tracks mid-stream?

It's not about what the spec supports, but what real-world streams provide.

I don't think it makes sense to put an event on every single type of
metadata that can change. Most of the time, when you have a stream
change, many variables will change together, so a single event is a
lot less events to raise. It's an event that signifies that the media
framework has reset the video/audio decoding pipeline and loaded a
whole bunch of new stuff. You should imagine it as a concatenation of
different media resources. And yes, they can have different track
constitution and different audio sampling rate (which the audio API
will care about) etc etc.

 In addition, it is possible for a stream to lose or gain an audio track. In this case the dimensions won't change but a script may want to react to the change in audioTracks.

The TrackList object has an onchanged event, which I assumed would fire when any of the information in the TrackList changes (e.g. tracks added or removed). But actually the spec doesn't state when this event fires (as far as I could tell - unless it is implied by some general definition of events called onchanged).

Should there be some clarification here ?

I understood that to relate to a change of cues only, since it is on
the tracklist. I.e. it's an aggregate event from the oncuechange event
of a cue inside the track. I didn't think it would relate to a change
of existence of that track.

Note that the even is attached to the TrackList, not the TrackList[],
so it cannot be raised when a track is added or removed, only when
something inside the TrackList changes.

Are we talking about the same thing ? There is no TrackList array and TrackList is only used for audio/video, not text, so I don't understand the comment about cues.

I'm talking about <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#tracklist">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#tracklist</A> which is the base class for MultipleTrackList and ExclusiveTrackList used to represent all the audio and video tracks (respectively). One instance of the object represents all the tracks, so I would assume that a change in the number of tracks is a change to this object.




 I agree with Silvia, a more generic &quot;metadata changed&quot; event makes more sense.

Yes, and it should support the case in which text tracks are added/removed too.

Yes, it needs to be an event on the MediaElement.


Also, as Eric (C) pointed out, one of the things which can change is which of seve
ral available versions of the content is being rendered (for adaptive bitrate cases). This doesn't necessarily change any of the metadata currently exposed on the video element, but nevertheless it's information that the application may need. It would be nice to expose some kind of identifier for the currently rendered stream and have an event when this changes. I think that a stream-format-supplied identifier would be sufficient.


I don't know about the adaptive streaming situation. I think that is
more about statistics/metrics rather than about change of resource.
All the alternatives in an adaptive streaming &quot;resource&quot; should
provide the same number of tracks and the same video dimensions, just
at different bitrate/quality, no?

I think of the different adaptive versions on a per-track basis (i.e. the alternatives are *within* each track), not a bunch of alternatives each of which contains several tracks. Both are possible, of course.

It's certainly possible (indeed common) for different bitrate video encodings to have different resolutions - there are video encoding reasons to do this. Of course the aspect ratio should not change and nor should the dimensions on the screen (both would be a little peculiar for the user).

Now, the videoWidth and videoHeight attributes of HTMLVideoElement are not the same as the resolution (for a start, they are in CSS pixels, which are square), but I think it quite likely that if the resolution of the video changes than the videoWidth and videoHeight might change. I'd be interested to hear how existing implementations relate resolution to videoWidth and videoHeight.


Different video dimensions should be
provided through the &lt;source&gt; element and @media attribute, but within
an adaptive stream, the alternatives should be consistent because the
target device won't change. I guess this is a discussion for another
thread... :-)

Possibly ;-) The device knows much better than the page author what capabilities it has and so what resolutions are suitable for the device. So it is better to provide all the alternatives as a single resource and have the device work out which subset it can support. Or at least, the list should be provided all at the same level - there is no rationale for a hierarchy of alternatives.


Cheers,
Silvia.
