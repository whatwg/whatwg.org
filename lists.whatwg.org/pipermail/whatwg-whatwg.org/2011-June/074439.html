</I>&gt;<i> is the base class for MultipleTrackList and ExclusiveTrackList used to

</I>
Ah yes, you're right: I got confused.

It says &quot;Whenever the selected track is changed, the user agent must
queue a task to fire a simple event named change at the
MultipleTrackList object.&quot; This means it fires when the selectedIndex
is changed, i.e. the user chooses a different track for rendering. I
still don't think it relates to changes in the composition of tracks
of a resource. That should be something different and should probably
be on the MediaElement and not on the track list to also cover changes
in text tracks.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, as Eric (C) pointed out, one of the things which can change is which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of several available versions of the content is being rendered (for adaptive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bitrate cases). This doesn't necessarily change any of the metadata
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> currently exposed on the video element, but nevertheless it's information
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that the application may need. It would be nice to expose some kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> identifier for the currently rendered stream and have an event when this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> changes. I think that a stream-format-supplied identifier would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sufficient.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know about the adaptive streaming situation. I think that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more about statistics/metrics rather than about change of resource.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All the alternatives in an adaptive streaming &quot;resource&quot; should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide the same number of tracks and the same video dimensions, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at different bitrate/quality, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think of the different adaptive versions on a per-track basis (i.e. the
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives are *within* each track), not a bunch of alternatives each of
</I>&gt;<i> which contains several tracks. Both are possible, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's certainly possible (indeed common) for different bitrate video
</I>&gt;<i> encodings to have different resolutions - there are video encoding reasons
</I>&gt;<i> to do this. Of course the aspect ratio should not change and nor should the
</I>&gt;<i> dimensions on the screen (both would be a little peculiar for the user).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, the videoWidth and videoHeight attributes of HTMLVideoElement are not
</I>&gt;<i> the same as the resolution (for a start, they are in CSS pixels, which are
</I>&gt;<i> square), but I think it quite likely that if the resolution of the video
</I>&gt;<i> changes than the videoWidth and videoHeight might change.&#160;I'd be interested
</I>&gt;<i> to hear how existing implementations relate resolution to videoWidth and
</I>&gt;<i> videoHeight.
</I>
Well, if videoWidth and videoHeight change and no dimensions on the
video are provided through CSS, then surely the video will change size
and the display will shrink. That would be a terrible user experience.
For that reason I would suggest that such a change not be made in
alternative adaptive streams.


&gt;&gt;<i> Different video dimensions should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided through the &lt;source&gt; element and @media attribute, but within
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an adaptive stream, the alternatives should be consistent because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target device won't change. I guess this is a discussion for another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread... :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly ;-) The device knows much better than the page author what
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities it has and so what resolutions are suitable for the device. So
</I>&gt;<i> it is better to provide all the alternatives as a single resource and have
</I>&gt;<i> the device work out which subset it can support. Or at least, the list
</I>&gt;<i> should be provided all at the same level - there is no rationale for a
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy of alternatives.
</I>
The way in which HTML deals with different devices and their different
capabilities is through media queries. As a author you provide your
content with different versions of media-dependent style sheets and
content, so that when you view the page with a different device, the
capabilities of the device select the right style sheet and content
for display on that device. Opera has an example on how to use this
here: <A HREF="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/everything-you-need-to-know-about-html5-video-and-audio/">http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/everything-you-need-to-know-about-html5-video-and-audio/</A>
(search for &quot;Media Query&quot;).

I believe that this mechanism should also work for adaptive streaming,
such that you provide multiple alternative media resources through the
&lt;source&gt; element, each of which has a @media attribute that says what
device capabilities that particular resource is adequate for. Except
that the &quot;media resource&quot; provides alternative bitrate files for that
case. I do not see a need to move this functionality into the adaptive
streaming file.

Nice to get started on this discussion about adaptive streaming. ;-)


Cheers,
Silvia.
