</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started fiddling with it in WF2, the only way type=radio controls had any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relationship to other type=radio controls was with their behaviour when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they were clicked. Now, for required=&quot;&quot;, we needed a little more than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, because otherwise required=&quot;&quot; was essentially useless for radio 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buttons, but I tried to be faithful to the original design and kept it as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; independent as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the end I'll spec whatever gets implemented. What do other browser 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vendors feel about this? Should we make required=&quot;&quot; on any one type=radio 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control affect the validity of all the other controls? Or should we stick 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the independent basis of this API?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a browser vendor but my first opinion is that radio buttons
</I>&gt;<i> should use any @required attribute in the radio button group. Rationale:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. [In case all inputs should have @required set instead of any input in
</I>&gt;<i> the radio button group:] From an author point of view, having a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> radio input elements with @required attribute set is not intuitive at
</I>&gt;<i> all because end user cannot ever select all @required inputs in that case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. [In case any input having @required is enough:] I agree with Ian that
</I>&gt;<i> currently type=radio controls are almost independent. However, the way
</I>&gt;<i> @selected already works in a radio button group, the @required attribute
</I>&gt;<i> would match the behavior quite well. From author point of view, this
</I>&gt;<i> would seem a bit illogical, too: the end user is free to select some
</I>&gt;<i> other input but @required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Saying that, I'd prefer having explicit not-allowed selection in a radio
</I>&gt;<i> button group to represent the fact that something must be selected. That
</I>&gt;<i> way the end user could intentionally reset the radio button group to the
</I>&gt;<i> initial state. Should there also be support for UI style where radio
</I>&gt;<i> button group has an item initially selected that makes the group
</I>&gt;<i> suffering from being missing (logically one input type=radio in a radio
</I>&gt;<i> group would have both @selected and @not-allowed set)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, a reasonable compromise solution to these use cases would be
</I>&gt;<i> to add @required attribute to any acceptable radio button item. In that
</I>&gt;<i> case, the case where nothing is initially selected in a radio button
</I>&gt;<i> group would be represented with a source where every item in radio
</I>&gt;<i> button group had @required and none had @selected. On the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i> the style where one input had @selected initially could be represented
</I>&gt;<i> with markup where initial input had @selected but not @required and all
</I>&gt;<i> the other inputs had @required. That would be interpreted as a initial
</I>&gt;<i> selection of radio button item that is not allowed for the radio button
</I>&gt;<i> group (at least one other item has @required and the currently selected
</I>&gt;<i> item does not have @required, in other words, should not be considered
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be a nice match for UI sometimes seen in web service EULAs:
</I>&gt;<i> [type=radio @selected] I do not accept license terms.
</I>&gt;<i> [type=radio @required] I accept the license terms.
</I>
This is an interesting argument.

I haven't gone this way, mostly because having an explicit option that 
isn't a valid option seems like rather odd UI. If it turns out that people 
do this a lot (you can do it with script and setCustomValidity(), e.g.) 
then we should consider adding a new attribute for this specifically.

I did, however, change the spec to say that required=&quot;&quot; only has to be set 
on one &lt;input type=radio&gt; to make all of them be required, and all of them 
be invalid, which hopefully makes this somewhat more understandable. (This 
change was actually made a while ago in response to other feedback.)
