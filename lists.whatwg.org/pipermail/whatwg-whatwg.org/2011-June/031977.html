Thanks to everyone contributing on this thread -- though it has not so far 
resulted in a change to the spec, this was a model discussion.

Indeed.

</I>
Indeed. Also, grouping is, to some extent, a semantic reason. It's rare 
that people wrap completely unrelated things in a &lt;div&gt; just for the sake 
of it.

That's &lt;div&gt;.

Etymologically, &lt;div&gt; comes from the word &quot;division&quot;, which is the result 
of wrapping.

</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/wrapper&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/header&gt;
</I>
Yeah. &lt;div&gt; is the right element here. That's what it's for.


&gt;<i> Answer this, Are wrappers purely internal to my(of mine) application? 
</I>&gt;<i> that's a capitalized lie, just think on it. Most applications use a 
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper-like div. You had, and i don't know you.
</I>
The spec explicitly says of &lt;div&gt; that it can be used &quot;to mark up 
semantics common to a group of consecutive elements&quot;. If that's not 
wrapping, I don't know what is!


&gt;<i> We have to start deciding what do we want from html5, at what degree do 
</I>&gt;<i> we want a more semantic web? why just &lt;header&gt;, why just &lt;footer&gt;.
</I>
Because those are commonly styled separately from other parts of the page, 
basically.


&gt;<i> I can assure you the world was fine with &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;, but so, why
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;header&gt; was created for?
</I>
It's shorter.


&gt;<i> It was created because being so widely used, somebody believed it was 
</I>&gt;<i> *more semantic* to convert it into an element.
</I>
Not really. It was created because being so widely used, it seemed 
convenient to have a shorthand way of doing it.


&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;div&gt; is the wrapper element.  That's its entire purpose for living.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt; was not creating for wrapping things, but for contain them. When 
</I>&gt;<i> you wrap something, you are giving it a different implicit meaning to 
</I>&gt;<i> that wrapper div.
</I>
This is splitting hairs thinner than I can see. Wrapping and containing 
are the same thing. :-)

Indeed.

I have no idea what this means. What is the difference between &quot;conveying 
structure&quot; and &quot;conveying semantics&quot; and something being &quot;not structural&quot; 
but instead &quot;purely presentational&quot; at the block level?

Certainly improving CSS would go a long way towards resolving many of 
these &quot;wrapping&quot; issues. There haven't been many good proposals for doing 
this, though (my own proposals being amongst the worst!). If we could find 
a way to wrap things for CSS, it would solve problems across many aspects 
of the language, including e.g. the commonly requested &lt;di&gt; for &lt;dl&gt;.

&lt;g&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are essentially identical, as far as I can tell (modulo 
their specific roles in graphics and text respectively).


&gt;<i> The distinction between &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; isn't all that obvious since we

</I>
&lt;span&gt; is just the inline version of &lt;div&gt;, that's all. The only 
difference is that &lt;div&gt; introduces line breaks in the default rendering. 
They are otherwise identical.


&gt;<i> Given that SVG and HTML are now interminglable in the same document, why 
</I>&gt;<i> not start intermingling their tag definitions?
</I>
Well there's the practical issue of the namespaces, not sure how we'd 
solve that.
