During a minor audit of some of my work on this list, I discovered that 
the e-mail below from 2009 never made it to the mailing list; it likely 
got stuck in moderation due to the size limit. In the interests of 
completeness, I'm forwarding it now. Apologies for the quite ludicrous 
delay in publicly replying to some of the e-mails in this batch reply!

Assuming this is talking about quote marks, we ended up requiring the UAs 
to include them in the rendering, since that's what all browsers do now.

The difference is a design difference: CSS is intended to be an optional 
layer above the logic to change the presentation, whereas scripting can be 
used both for that purpose or for defining the actual logic. HTML is just 
for the logic part.

Or to put it another way: CSS is media-dependant; script can be both 
media-dependant or independant, and HTML(5) is media-independant.

Indeed, with HTML5 we will increase the usage of scripting, I hope, while 
decreasing the usage of scripting for features that have often been 
implemented in the past.

It appears that even small steps are useful in practice.

But it only has to be written once, and it is only necessary for the years

It appears to be incorrect that incremental edge additions don't achieve

&gt;<i> &gt; you have to take the position that there will be a migration to XForms

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the way that they are designed to be used. In practice, I'm thoroughly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unconvinced of the first and skeptical of the second.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However you have the same problems with the migration to WebForms and

There are a variety of alternative mechanisms one can use now, such as

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the point is that incremental edge additions to HTML won't achieve

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Achieve in what sense? It certianly has the possibility of making many

Based on feedback from the GMail team, this doesn't seem to have been 
shown to the be the case. While there will naturally be a transition 
period, numerous developers have indicated an interest in using HTML5 
technologies today.


&gt;<i> Web Forms, like any technology will take a long time to get popular, the

Indeed.


&gt;<i> It seems to me that so many of the people here are thinking in the 1998

It appears that incremental improvements do still work.


&gt;<i> So what is it?  What's the significant advantage - will it reduce my 
</I>&gt;<i> development costs?  Will it improve my users experience? or ....
</I>
All of the above, it appears.


&gt;<i> &gt; I thought the new consensus was that implementations before 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spefications had reached a stable Call For Implementations phase were 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a bad thing anyway?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course it's a bad thing, but that doesn't change the fact it's not

</I>&gt;<i> penetrate the market in the mean-time, the less the use case to using it 
</I>&gt;<i> will be, since as well as the legacy aspect of IE to consider, there's 
</I>&gt;<i> the legacy aspect of all these installed users.
</I>
The future appears to be coming along quickly now. Patience was all that 
we needed.


&gt;<i> &gt; They don't suffer from the same fundamental problems. Webforms allows 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you to extend existing documents. In simple cases this will be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effortlessly backward compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but in those simple cases, the vast majority of your users get a crap 
</I>&gt;<i> user experience.
</I>
For now.


&gt;<i> &gt; XForms requires that you ditch everything you know, learn a bunch of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex specs, find a CMS that will deal with XML in a sane way and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then start again with all your content. It precludes any possibility 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of backwards compatibility. These are hardly the equivalent situations 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you make out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, you're selling webforms over XForms, you've not yet sold the 
</I>&gt;<i> case for WebForms over HTML4 forms.  I'm no XForms fan, I have less 
</I>&gt;<i> belief in what the HTML WG are doing than this organisation, but at 
</I>&gt;<i> least they've realised playing at HTML ages isn't really too profitable.
</I>
Profit doesn't have to be the ultimate motive.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - You can create compatible WebForms docs within the single 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; document, but it's far from trivial, and you miss out on quite a few 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the benefits.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So there are benefits to WebForms after all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's benefits to all sorts of things, they need to outweigh the cost 
</I>&gt;<i> though to be used.  If I thought there was no value in Web Forms at all, 
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't be wasting my time here, there's some value, and there could 
</I>&gt;<i> be a miracle that meant it succeeded, I very much doubt it, but if it 
</I>&gt;<i> did, then I need to ensure that it meets my needs as much as I possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> can.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment WebForms offers very little, for average cost.  XForms 
</I>&gt;<i> combined with other XML workflows offers a lot for an absolutely huge 
</I>&gt;<i> cost.  Neither are providing a reason to move.  Web Forms has always

Many people have now found reason to be excited about HTML5 features.

Making things easier and better on the long term is a good goal, even if

doing this kind of thing.

In the case of forums, HTML5's new elements help by making it easier to

That kind of validation won't scale with ICANN's recent forays.


&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed. They could have used HTML 4's &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot;&gt; to point 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the iCal data from the HTML page. Sadly, the convenience of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, which is why it makes sense to create web-application language

Indeed.


&gt;<i> &gt; But that's a parallel problem to the problem of a sutiable language

I'm not sure what you mean here.


&gt;<i> &gt; Not at all. There are two questions here - can we make the front ends

It is clear that UA implementors would like their controls to feel native,

As you said earlier, let's see what they can do, before prematurely 
deciding something is a huge implementation burden.


&gt;<i> &gt; By constraining the date control to follow a simple format string, a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of UI power is lost. (Btw. the point of hiding the hint for WF2 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compliant browsers is lost if WF2 users should enter data in the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same format.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but &quot;UI Power&quot; isn't always the only important thing - ease of data 
</I>&gt;<i> entry, which is I think the main point of Matthew here, is such that 
</I>&gt;<i> forcing the format is useful - of course you don't need to use the input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;date&quot; in this scenario, (do you in any?) but it is an important 
</I>&gt;<i> usecase, I've yet to see a date control on any platform that is as fast 
</I>&gt;<i> to enter a date as an &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; - of course that's only 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant if you know the date to input, lots of the time you don't, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is why we have the richer controls because they provide 
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
For the native control, the spec doesn't preclude the UA from using this 
kind of data entry, but the Web author can't know what format the UA will 
expect, and so can't provide the format string.


&gt;<i> &gt; But I think its a good idea to be able to specify the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; submission format, since this will make adoption and backwards 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatibility easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, and picking a format string vocab shouldn't be hard, there's

</I>
I ended up picking just a simplified form of ISO 8601's formats. This 
doesn't give as much flexibility, but it's relatively easy to add a 
conversion step on the server side so it shouldn't be a huge issue.

Agreed. I'm not sure how to fix this; we can't very well dictate UI.

&gt;<i> &gt; Its fast to type a date in your native format, however its not as fast

It seems reasonable to assume that a user will be familiar with their

I reject the premise of your question; libraries are quite successful.


&gt;<i> &gt; For example, it assumes that a UA either supports all of the new

Your faith in the power of conformance requirements surpasses mine.

</I>
Could you elaborate on this?


&gt;<i> &gt; Given past experience with the way UAs implement specs a bit at a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time, I really don't think this is a good assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but as all the likely implementors of the spec are members of the group, 
</I>&gt;<i> that can be controlled pretty easily.
</I>
Browser vendors are not an easily controlled group. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; I also am not too happy about the idea of introducing an element 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; purely for the purpose of hiding content from new UAs -- effectively 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deprecating the element straight away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good point, using OBJECT for this would be much better, as we're 
</I>&gt;<i> re-using an existing element with just the semantics we want...
</I>
&lt;object&gt; seems to have little to know relation to date picker widgets, 
unless I'm missing something fundamental here.


&gt;<i> &gt; Most of the JS was added at Jim's insistence, so as to degrade 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gracefully in UAs with two or three users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except you've still not done so, you're still using lots of code that is 
</I>&gt;<i> used on browsers with significant user share, the use of toFixed is 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly crazy.
</I>
How so?


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, the code takes care of the timezone problem (which &lt;format&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't). It also handles hiding the format just for supported types 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so it works with incomplete WF2 UAs, and has graceful fallback in both 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WF2 and non-WF2 UAs when JS is disabled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No it doesn't it doesn't make any real attempt to see if the UA already 
</I>&gt;<i> supports Web Forms 2.0.
</I>
I beg to differ.


&gt;<i> &gt; Not really, the code is generic and can be cut-and-pasted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all, that code relies on a particular html structure, it's hardly 
</I>&gt;<i> generic.
</I>
I do not think this is an undue burden.


&gt;<i> &gt; In most UAs the current value is selected when you tab into a control, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so that doesn't seem like a serious problem. Also, as you say, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only an issue when JS is disabled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You've also still not addressed the fallback situation when you want to 
</I>&gt;<i> pre-populate the fields with data, rather than the format, something 
</I>&gt;<i> which is the default behaviour for a huge number of usecases.
</I>
If you prepopulate with data, the format is likely obvious.


&gt;<i> &gt; A company that requires that all its employees have the exact same 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; date and time settings for display purposes has much bigger problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem would not appear if a company did indeed mandate such, that 
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't the issue raised though, they may want a common input format, not 
</I>&gt;<i> a common display format.
</I>
I don't follow. Could you elaborate?


&gt;<i> &gt; You'll almost certainly have to anyway, since without type=&quot;date&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc, authors are more likely to use a number of &lt;select&gt;s than a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single field.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So we really should be looking at a method which can fallback to the 
</I>&gt;<i> existing well understood, well supported format - there's even been such 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals on the list.
</I>
Again, I think you are overestimating the need for fallback here. Sure, we 
need fallback so that once 99% of users are covered using either script 
libraries or native implementations, the remaining 1% can still _use_ the 
page even if not ideally so; however, it's unlikely that authors would 
want to adopt these features until that was possible, so graceful fallback 
for more users isn't that necessary, IMHO.


&gt;<i> &gt; By supporting most formats automatically, like the demo does, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really see that there is a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can assume you've never done a lot of QA on javascript intensive sites

</I>
Your assumption is mistaken.

&gt;<i> &gt; The &lt;format&gt; elements above could also, IMHO, be replaced by &lt;span&gt;

There are plenty of ways to detect support, as many of these demos in fact

If I could encourage you to use punctuation other than commas, that would

The problem with a new element is that we don't instantly get good

case we end up with legacy and future UAs having different numbers of 
elements in the form.elements array.

New elements are preferable to overloading orthogonal functionality on

We have the &quot;hidden&quot; attribute to remove this content from all media now, 
which can be used with the events to show them at the right time, if you

As you say, for links and lists and the like it's not hard. There's no

&lt;var&gt;.

getElementsByClassName() no longer uses the array form. Even if it did,

That is true, though one need not get upset about it. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I do not personally see the use case for a class specific operator, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; either a CSS Selector method, that selects on any CSS selector, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; nothing seems appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With all due respect, whether you personally see the use case for a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific method to be defined for use by all web authors is largely 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well everyone's opinions on the list are largely irrelevant, the WHAT 
</I>&gt;<i> individual has sole discretion of what goes in.
</I>
Am I the &quot;WHAT individual&quot; you are referring to? What a strange title.


&gt;<i> &gt; If other authors and designers do see use cases and have concrete 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; examples of where this function would add a great deal of power and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flexibility to their tool set, it is worth consideration and design.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But a CSSSelector method has more power, not less, and adds little in 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation complexity surely?
</I>
There are pros and cons to both. For various reasons, we've ended up with 
both, as it happens.


&gt;<i> &gt; It is unfair to the rest of the contributors to this specification and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web authors in general to hold up the design and/or implementation of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a (generally-agreed) useful tool due to simple personal differences in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; taste or opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not holding up anything?  This is not a democracy.  If you want a 
</I>&gt;<i> quality specification though, you engage in debates with people who have 
</I>&gt;<i> opposite ideas.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> People have shown enough use cases that indicate the ability to select 
</I>&gt;<i> elements by a css selector is a useful function - they've not made the 
</I>&gt;<i> case to me at all that a class name specific one is useful though.
</I>
getElementsByClassName() is similar to getElementById() and 
getElementsByTagName() in being special-cased variants of querySelector() 
optimised for specific subsets of the general functionality. It turns out 
that for all three, there are a number of cases where the special-cased 
version is more useful. For example, the HTML5 spec itself would use 
getElementsByClassName() to find all the elements with class=XXX if we 
were to provide some sort of UI to jump to them.


&gt;<i> &gt; Ian has already indicated that the specification of a method to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collect DOM elements based on a CSS selector is best left to the CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WG.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then why isn't className?  or why don't we just wait for that, having 
</I>&gt;<i> both cssselector and classname is needless verbosity.  Whilst 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of ClassName is trivial if you CSSSelector, increasing 
</I>&gt;<i> the memory footprint of a DOM is not useful to anyone, and a severe 
</I>&gt;<i> limitation on getting it on many devices.
</I>
The incremental increase here is minimal, but in general I agree. As it 
happens, though, user agent implementors have jumped at implementing this 
particular feature.

If the user follows the link again, the UA should repost, sure. My point

The advantage is two-fold; first of all, it allows users to opt-out of the 
tracking, which is an advantage to publishers who care about their users' 
preferences (this is the main reason Google is interested in this 
feature), and secondly, it reduces the latency impact of tracking 
dramatically, making for a faster user experience.

There are advantages to sending hyperlink instrumentation data as obtained

It depends whether your greed outweighs your respect for your readers, I 
guess. Or to put it another way, whether you care more about short-term 
gains or long-term gains, since not respecting your users tends to hurt 
long-term growth.


&gt;<i> The use case of tracking what you click to leave a site is that it has

Making the tracking faster is indeed a direct win for users.

Without wanting to contradict you, I should point out that human behaviour

That's the wrong solution, since new features will be used in old user 
agents. However, we've solved this problem in a more backwards-compatible 
way now.

</I>
I think Hallvord was speaking more metaphorically.


&gt;<i> &gt; The only thing I want to discuss in this thread, is: should firing the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; submitted when it hasn't due to a validation error?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Couple of points to note off the top of my head:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would certainly agree that firing onsubmit after form validation

</I>&gt;<i> need an onaftervalidation type thing which fires after validation is
</I>&gt;<i> complete so WF2 aware UA's can do the same disabling/screen tidy up
</I>&gt;<i> that we want to do.
</I>
I've now switched the order and added oninvalid=&quot;&quot; events for hooking into 
the validation mechanism.


&gt;<i> Note I don't think this will still be compatible with all legacy

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a onclick=&quot;disableUI();documente.forms[0].submit();&quot;&gt;

This hould now work also, since .submit() doesn't validate the form.
