Indeed.

How so?


&gt;<i> Also browsers don't all do this.
</I>
They all don't do whatever else we come up with to solve this, too.


&gt;<i> In my opinion it is not sufficient to have solely the browser UI cover

</I>
If you really want to control it from within the page, just use another 
credential mechanism, like form-submitted login and cookies.


&gt;<i> Also as web developers are requesting this over and over again there 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be a real need.
</I>
Compared to other features, this is not requested that often.


&gt;<i> Just saying that the web browser UI should do it is not getting the job 
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>
Why would it be any more effective to do anything else?


&gt;<i> Most prominently however how is a web browser suppose to know which 
</I>&gt;<i> credentials to dump when the user hits a logout button in the web 
</I>&gt;<i> browser UI. During a page load multiple origins can be accessed and all 
</I>&gt;<i> may require credentials.
</I>
That's also a UI issue. For example, the browser could just dump all the 
credentials for the sessions started in the current tab, or it could show 
the user a list of credentials that the user can pick to drop.


&gt;<i> But it seems mostly natural in a web application to include a logout 
</I>&gt;<i> button. I don't know of any web applications not having one.
</I>
If they all have it, then there's no problem. :-)


&gt;<i> So why is it suddenly sufficient that the browser UI could have a logout 
</I>&gt;<i> button?
</I>
For HTTP auth, the login is also done by the browser's UI. So it makes 
sense that the logout should be done by the browser also.


&gt;<i> And if it should why is it not being required in any spec?
</I>
We don't require UI of any kind.


&gt;<i> The whole purpose of these specs is to have some common denominator so 
</I>&gt;<i> building web sites/applications does not require having to know 
</I>&gt;<i> everything about every possible browser in use. It's about making life 
</I>&gt;<i> easy not hard. I really think some influential spec should say something 
</I>&gt;<i> about this.
</I>
There aren't really any influential specs when it comes to UI (or much of 
anything else -- specs only appear influential if they happen to spec what 
implementors want to do anyway).


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I prefer to use HTTP authentication mostly as it is build-in anyways 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and has richer features then pure form-based authentication.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What features does it have that other mechanisms do not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP authentication like HTTP itself is stateless. Form-based 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication isn't and requires the extra hurdle of having to persist 
</I>&gt;<i> a session key.
</I>
Ironically, it's the fact that HTTP authentication is state_ful_ that is 
causing you trouble here.


&gt;<i> As far as I can judge, form-based authentication has no pros over HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication. Other then the web developer being able to create a 
</I>&gt;<i> working logout procedure. Please note that one can also use a form to 
</I>&gt;<i> gather the credentials and login in through AJAX. But mostly I like the 
</I>&gt;<i> idea of it being in the HTTP protocol itself. Rather then implemented on 
</I>&gt;<i> top of it.
</I>
That seems very arbitrary.


&gt;<i> It allows for futures expansions like upgrading to more secure 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication methods like Kerberos (I believe Microsoft is already 
</I>&gt;<i> doing this) or using client certificates (already possible). I don't see 
</I>&gt;<i> this happening with form-based authentication. When logging out is 
</I>&gt;<i> possible and well supported I actually see these more secure 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication methods becoming mainstream.
</I>
I'm rather skeptical, personally. Client certificates are an 
authentication mechanism that baffles regular users.

</I>
I recommend bringing these questions up with browser vendors and seeing if 
they are interested in implementing some experimental features for it, as 
per this question in the FAQ:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F</A>

One question that I think is relevant for such a proposal is: how can a 
Web page know when a session has ended? Users don't typically hit the 
logout button, do they?

Then again, personally I never consider my sessions over. Once I've logged 
in, I want to remain logged in until the machine dies a final death. It 
drives me crazy that I keep having to log in to my bank's Web app.

</I>
At least for the purposes of the WHATWG, this is not the case. We are only 
focusing on making the Web better. Other applications may benefit as a 
side-effect, but they are not a consideration. We have enough difficulty 
making a language for the Web without trying to make it fit other worlds 
as well!

The first step here is describing the problem, not the solution.

We can't evaluate solutions without knowing what problems they solve.

You can bookmark GMail pages just fine as far as I can tell.

</I>
That doesn't really seem compatible with how the Web works. In the Web you 
can go to a page, then open links from that page in many tabs, then close 
some, open more, then close all of them, then unclose a tab, then bookmark 
it, then reboot, then reopen the bookmark...

I don't really understand what problem a &quot;session&quot; concept solves. The 
problems with authentication on the Web today aren't about session ends, 
they're about identity, lack of multi-factor login, weak passwords, weak 
account recovery features, etc. If anything is wrong with &quot;logout&quot; on the 
Web, it's that sites are too _eager_ to log me out, IMHO!


&gt;<i> Think of sessionEnd as terminating a regular desktop application.
</I>
Regular desktop applications are specifically moving _away_ from this 
model. See OS X Lion's session resume features, session restore in 
Firefox, Opera, Safari, or Chrome... heck, even software in the 90s (e.g. 
Turbo Pascal) used to resume sessions automatically. OSes themselves have 
long had suspend/hibernation features to resume state.

Terminating sessions seems to be largely considered a bug, not a feature.


&gt;<i> Does an OS notify you when you logged out of your e-mail client?
</I>
You can log out of desktop e-mail clients?
