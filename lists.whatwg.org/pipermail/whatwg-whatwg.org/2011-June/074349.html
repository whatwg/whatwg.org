<PRE>I sent this to the list from the wrong address and it bounced, so I'm
resending it from the right address.  You should probably read it
before you read Ryosuke's reply, which wound up getting to the list
first because he was CC'd and got my message despite it bouncing from
the list.

----

There are lots of cases where two different Ranges correspond to the
same user-visible selection, and in such cases, browsers should behave
the same for both.  For instance:

* &lt;b&gt;foo[]&lt;/b&gt;bar vs. &lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;[]bar: Is text typed by the user bold or not?
* &lt;div&gt;{}&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; vs. &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[]foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;: Is text typed
by the user on the same line as &quot;foo&quot;, or does it make a new line
before it?  (See <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662591">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662591</A>)
* &lt;p&gt;[foo]&lt;/p&gt; vs. {&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;}: If the user hits delete, is the whole
line deleted or only the text &quot;foo&quot;?

In each of these cases, some browsers will give different results,
despite the fact that as far as the user can see, they're taking the
exact same action.  Likewise, some types of selections will be
completely invisible to the user, but might behave differently from if
there were no selection: selections inside a Comment, say, or
&lt;p&gt;{}&lt;/p&gt;.

The logical solution here is to do some type of normalization on user
selections before taking any actions.  For instance, we could
normalize &lt;b&gt;foo&lt;/b&gt;[]bar to &lt;b&gt;foo[]&lt;/b&gt;bar before processing any
user typing.  This seems pretty clear -- if anyone disagrees, please
say so.

The question is when to do the normalization.  One way to do it would
be to normalize the selection immediately before running any
execCommand() or processing any user typing.  A variant on that would
be to first copy the range, then normalize the copy and act on that,
so you don't change the selection itself.  WebKit and Opera take a
different approach: they seem to normalize selections as soon as you
try to modify them.  For instance, see here:

<A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1025">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1025</A>

This sets the selection to &quot;&lt;p&gt;{}foo&quot; and logs the focus node.
IE9/Firefox 5.0a2 log a div element, while Chrome 13 dev/Opera 11.11
log a text node: they convert the selection to &quot;&lt;p&gt;[]foo&quot; (putting it
in the text node instead of the element).  So in WebKit and Opera, you
just can't get &quot;bad&quot; ranges in a selection.  Note that in IE and
Firefox, you usually can't get really unreasonable ranges via user
actions -- e.g., it's probably impossible to get a Selection with a
Comment node as a boundary point unless the author uses script to set
it that way.  But you can still get them if the author sets them
manually.

I originally thought the WebKit/Opera behavior was unreasonable, but
I've come around to thinking it makes more sense than IE/Gecko.  It's
simpler and more consistent.  If selections are always normalized, we
can ignore all sorts of crazy situations like boundary points in
comments, or between a character and a combining diacritic.  If we
allowed such selections, we'd have to add extra spec text and code to
handle them reasonably, despite the fact that they're corner cases
that should only arise if the author manually sets the selection to
something weird.

This benefit applies to authors too: they no longer have to worry
about crazy selections.  When researching execCommand() usage in major
software packages, I found that vBulletin's editor assumed that all
selection boundary points are either Elements or Text nodes.  Should
we really ask them to also account for every other node type
(Document, DocumentType, DocumentFragment, Comment,
ProcessingInstruction) to make their code correct, when such node
types will only arise in pathological cases?  Removing corner cases
makes it easier to write correct code, both for authors and
implementers, and we should do so if there's not good reason to keep
them.

So I want to standardize some variant of the WebKit/Opera behavior,
and guarantee that selection boundary points are always
reasonable-looking (for some definition of reasonable TBD).  This
would be a change to the existing spec text and the two biggest
implementations, however, so I'd like to hear what everyone has to
think before I start.
