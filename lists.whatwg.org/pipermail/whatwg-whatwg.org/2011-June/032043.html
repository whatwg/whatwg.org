</I>
The spec is defined such that attribute setting during element creation is 
order-agnostic. I believe this is consistent with what authors expect (in 
part based on the confusion I've seen when authors run into cases where 
that isn't the case). How you implement that is somewhat orthogonal to how 
it is specced; if there are specific things that are hard to implement, 
I'm happy to discuss them specifically if you like.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; atomic operation; if so it needs to say that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The operation it describes is a single operation: create a node. It

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the node have the various tokenised attributes set. I don't understand 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how creating a node could be anything other than atomic -- either it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exists or it does not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're expecting several operations to happen at the same time. We could

</I>&gt;<i> storing the calculated type of an input, calculating the effective URI 
</I>&gt;<i> of an image, etc. This involves several separate pieces of state and so 
</I>&gt;<i> can't happen &quot;all at the same time&quot;.
</I>
Sure. When those things happen is defined by the spec too.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This does not seem desirable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can't argue that it's desireable, but it's how the Web works, as I

Right, the behaviour is different when the parser does it. This is per 
spec, and seems to match what Firefox does.
