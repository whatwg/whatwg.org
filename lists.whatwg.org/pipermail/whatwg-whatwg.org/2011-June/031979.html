Please let us know how this goes, so I can update the spec accordingly (to 
at least allow this, or maybe require it, depending on how other browser 
vedors feel about this).

Presumably this would continue to work, indeed.

Well the browser is always allowed to just close things willy nilly, sure.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3. also if we are keeping them, can we add an optional parameter for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a timeout milliseconds to self dismiss the modal prompt.

</I>&gt;<i> For comment 3, simply reference the use cases for Microsoft's AfxMsgBox, 
</I>&gt;<i> ::MessageBox and its derivatives. The time out is a well-received idea.

</I>&gt;<i> we should.  You need to give actual specific use-cases, not just cite 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the feature exists in Windows.
</I>
I have to agree with Aryeh here.

</I>
The existence of an API is not a use case (and Aryeh's comments weren't an 
ad hominem attack -- the only attack, if any, was in the description of 
timer-based messaging APIs as &quot;terrible&quot;, but he backed that up with sound 
reasoning).


&gt;<i> You are correct that short duration time outs are, often, a terrible

</I>&gt;<i> ideas are a matter of opinion; my ideas are always grand and glorious, 
</I>&gt;<i> never terrible ... just ask me ... for I never lie and am always right.
</I>
It's our job to filter out the bad ideas.


&gt;<i> ...and consider this: just how would you handle the case in which the 
</I>&gt;<i> WWWeb page says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    There is an approaching storm!

</I>&gt;<i>       No (let everybody drown)
</I>&gt;<i>       Yes (if you don't answer in an hour, this will be the default)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To say that the WWWeb should not be used for this is in itself a 
</I>&gt;<i> terrible idea for you know that it will be used in this manner and 
</I>&gt;<i> neither of us can prevent such stupidities.
</I>
I think this kind of thing might be reasonable to have, but the way to do 
that is probably more using a non-modal inline dialog, so that the script 
can react to the storm's sudden growth or disappearance as well.

Do we have any data on whether these warnings have any useful effect?
