If you use explicit L: placement, we could turn off the scrolling behaviour.

I don't think your example is a typical one. In my (unmeasured)
experience, the scrolling behaviour is much more typical.

In fact, that example of yours is really really confusing to me. I
would much prefer if the text wasn't displayed on top of each other,
but at different locations on the screen - one to the right one to the
left, preferably underneath the people that speak. That is a better
experience. I believe that example of yours only looks that way
because somebody had to work around the problem that the subtitle
authoring format didn't allow for such explicit placement.


&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually, we will want to get rid of the legacy format and just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deliver WebVTT, but they still need to display as though they came
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the original broadcast caption format for contractual reasons.

</I>
I think the opposite is true. Right now, people work around some of
the ways in which they really would like to render their captions
because the formats don't allow for example explicit placement.
Therefore we get poor quality captions right now. With the features
available, we should see better captions, not worse.

Regards,
Silvia.
