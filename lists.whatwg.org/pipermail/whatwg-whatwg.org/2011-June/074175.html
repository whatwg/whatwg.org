Not at all, it seems. Both VLC and Totem allow setting the character  
encoding and font used for subtitles in the (global) preferences menu, so  
presumably you would change that if the default doesn't work. Font  
switching seems to mainly be an issue when your system has other default  
fonts than the text you're reading, and it appears that is rare enough  
that very little software does anything about it, browsers perhaps being  
an exception.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The IDs are useful for referencing cues from script, so I haven't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; removed them. I've also left the parsing as is for when neither the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; first nor second line is a timing line, since that gives us a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; headroom for future extensions (we can do anything so long as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; second line doesn't start with a timestamp and &quot;--&gt;&quot; and another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; timestamp).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the case of feeding future extensions to current parsers, it's way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better fallback behavior to simply ignore the unrecognized second line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than to discard the entire cue. The current behavior seems unnecessarily

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preference is just ignore anything preceding the timing line, but even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if we must have IDs it can still be made simpler and more robust than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is currently spec'ed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we just ignore content until we hit a line that happens to look like a
</I>&gt;<i> timing line, then we are much more constrained in what we can do in the
</I>&gt;<i> future. For example, we couldn't introduce a &quot;comment block&quot; syntax,  
</I>&gt;<i> since
</I>&gt;<i> any comment containing a timing line wouldn't be ignored. On the other

</I>&gt;<i> just by having its first line include a &quot;--&gt;&quot; but not have it match the
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp syntax, e.g. by having it be &quot;--&gt; COMMENT&quot; or some such.
</I>
One of us must be confused, do you mean something like this?

1
--&gt; COMMENT
00:00.000 --&gt; 00:01.000
Cue text

Adding this syntax would break the *current* parser, as it would fail in  
step 39 (Collect WebVTT cue timings and settings) and then skip the rest  
of the cue. If we want any room for extensions along these lines, then  
multiple lines preceding the timing line must be handled gracefully.

&gt;<i> Looking at the parser more closely, I don't really see how doing anything
</I>&gt;<i> more complex than skipping the block entirely would be simpler than what
</I>&gt;<i> we have now, anyway.
</I>
I suggest:

  * Step 31: Try to &quot;collect WebVTT cue timings and settings&quot; instead of  
checking for the substring &quot;--&gt;&quot;. If it succeeds, jump to what is now step  
40. If it fails, continue at what is now step 32. (This allows adding any  
syntax as long as it doesn't exactly match a timing line, including &quot;--&gt;  
COMMENT&quot;. As a bonus, one can fail faster when trying to parse an entire  
timing line rather than doing a substring search for &quot;--&gt;&quot;.)

  * Step 32: Only set the id line if it's not already set. (Assuming we  
want the first line to be the id line in future extensions.)

  * Step 39: Jump to the new step 31.

In case not every detail is correct, the idea is to first try to match a  
timing line and to take the first line that is not a timing line (if any)  
as the id, leaving everything in between open for future syntax changes,  
even if they use &quot;--&gt;&quot;.

I think it's fairly important that we handle this. Double id lines is an  
easy mistake to make when copying things around. Silently dropping those  
cues would be worse than what many existing (line-based, id-ignoring) SRT  
parsers do.

</I>
To expand a bit more on the problem and suggested solution, consider the  
example cue &quot;This sentence is spoken by a single speaker and is presented  
as a single cue.&quot;

If simple line-wrapping (how browsers currently render text) is used it  
might be:

&quot;This sentence is spoken by a single speaker and is presented as a
single cue.&quot;

Subtitles tend to be line-wrapped to have more balanced line width, and at  
least I would certainly much prefer this line wrapping:

&quot;This sentence is spoken by a single speaker
and is presented as a single cue.&quot;

Apart from being easier to read, this is also much more suitable for  
left/right-alignment in cases where that is used to associate the cue with  
a speaker on screen. With WebVTT, one would have to manually line-break  
the text to get this result. Apart from wasting the time of the captioner,  
it will also break if a slightly larger font is used -- you might get this  
rendering instead:

&quot;This sentence is spoken by a single
speaker
and is presented as a single cue.&quot;

In other cases you might get 4 lines where 3 would have been enough. This  
is not a theoretical issue, I see it fairly with SRT subtitles rendered at  
another size than was tested with.

My suggested solution is to first layout the text using all of the  
available width. Then, decrease the width as much as possible without  
increasing the number of line breaks. The algorithm should also prefer to  
make the first line the longest, as this is IMO more aesthetically  
pleasing.

I would like to see this specified and would gladly implement it in Opera,  
but in which spec does it belong? It seems fairly subtitling-specific to  
me, so if it could be in the WebVTT rendering rules to begin with (as  
opposed to CSS with vendor prefixes) that would be at least short-term  
awesome. It's only if this is the default line-wrapping for &lt;track&gt;+WebVTT  
that people are going to discover this and stop manually line-breaking  
their captions.

For now, Opera has made it impossible to change the internal preload state  
 from a higher state to a lower state specifically to prevent this. If  
script authors could start and stop the buffering at will, it would  
certainly be abused to perform throttling using lots of small requests. If  
the buffering behavior of browsers is broken, I'd prefer to fix it (in  
spec or implementation) rather than to allow scripts to work around it.

The way I see it, that's just a matter of a user preference to limit the  
internal preload state to &quot;none&quot; regardless of what the content attribute.

&gt;&gt;<i> However, the state we're discussing is when the user has begun playing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> video. The spec doesn't talk about it, but I call it:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invoked: buffer as little as possible without readyState dropping below
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HAVE_FUTURE_DATA (in other words: being able to play from currentTime to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duration at playbackRate without waiting for the network)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's also a fifth state, let's call it &quot;aggressive&quot;, where even while

</I>
This is the same as &quot;auto&quot; for now, but sure, that could be improved.

&gt;&gt;<i> If the available bandwidth exceeds the bandwidth of the resource, some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of throttling must eventually be used. There are mainly 2 options
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for doing this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Throttle at the TCP level by not reading data from the socket (not  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to suspend, or at a controlled rate to buffer ahead)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Use HTTP byte ranges, making many smaller requests with any kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throttling at the TCP level
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's also option 3, to handle the fifth state above: don't throttle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When HTTP byte ranges are used to achieve bandwidth management, it's

</I>
I don't think that now is a good time to add more features to preload,  
given that what we have isn't interoperably implemented yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> The above buffering strategies are still not enough, because users seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to expect that in a low-bandwidth situation, the video will keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buffering until they can watch it through to the end. These seem to be

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Make sites that want this behavior set .preload='auto' in the 'paused'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event handler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Add an option in the context menu to &quot;Preload Video&quot; or some such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Cause an invoked (see dfn above) but paused video to behave like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preload=auto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * As above, but only when the available bandwidth is limited
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think any of these solutions are particularly good, so any input

</I>
That would be a good start. In Opera, playing the video causes the  
internal preload state to go to &quot;invoked&quot;.

By only updating the media state between tasks (or as tasks), the script  
that issued the seek could not see the state changed as a result of it.

Changing currentTime synchronously doesn't mean that seeking to that
