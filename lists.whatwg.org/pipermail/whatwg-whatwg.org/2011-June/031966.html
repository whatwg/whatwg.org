Well certainly there comes a point where there are simply too many workers 
for it to make sense.


&gt;<i> I think reasonable behavior when you exceed it is to throw an exception,

</I>&gt;<i> queueing behavior in the first place.
</I>
Implementations are essentially allowed to do whatever they want in the 
face of hardware limitations like this; we refer to this as the hardware 
limitations clause:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#hardwareLimitations">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#hardwareLimitations</A>


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Non-looping 0ms timers are common, to run code when the current call 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; finishes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, spec allows those fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I should have said &quot;non-recursive&quot;.  That is, you can run a 0ms timer 
</I>&gt;<i> from another timer without causing recursion, but you'll receive the 4ms 
</I>&gt;<i> clamping unnecessarily.  It might be possible to avoid this while still 
</I>&gt;<i> preventing 0ms looping timers from busy looping, but the spec prohibits 
</I>&gt;<i> that.  (I could give an example of how this would happen, but I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think it's important enough to go into further for now.)
</I>
What's the use case?

</I>&gt;<i> Okey, I see the (implementation of the) web standards as the ultimate

</I>&gt;<i> (if a browser is implementing the specs the same on both platforms). 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore its great if it supports as much of the usual behavior of 
</I>&gt;<i> programs. I understand that this is a long process but.. almost every 
</I>&gt;<i> thing is possible to inline with data-urls (wrote a simple script to do 
</I>&gt;<i> this for me) but not web workers. And if you want to hand over a program 
</I>&gt;<i> to a customer you want it to be 1 file, in many cases.
</I>
These standards are intended for the Web. You don't have to hand anything 
over other than a URL.


&gt;<i> The user case for my program is for a user that is a student that sits 
</I>&gt;<i> at his/her schools computer. Having a DAISY book and needs to read it 
</I>&gt;<i> with this app. The problem is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> that the user are not allowed to install new software therefor can't 
</I>&gt;<i> install a 'real' player.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that the user cant play it online because a book is to large
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that the File API right now you cant get hold of a whole folder 
</I>&gt;<i> structure.
</I>
Ah. This isn't really a use case I think we should try to solve at the 
WHATWG. The WHATWG is specifically about improving the Web.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [...] trying to build a more optimal standalone DAISY player (would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be nice if i could rewrite it with web workers).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now that's a problem. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems like what you need is a package mechanism, not necessarily a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to run workers without an external script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if i understand you correctly you suggests a module system for 
</I>&gt;<i> javascript? That would be nice but still web workers are needed fore 
</I>&gt;<i> more then that. And you can do module systems with a macro-compiler with 
</I>&gt;<i> out changing the specs.
</I>
I just mean zip up all the files and give that to the user.
