It's definitely an uncommonly complex scene to caption.  I raised it
wondering about the quality level the format can manage in the harder
cases.  (To be clear, this isn't something any of the popular ad hoc formats
can do, either--this was achieved with a brittle rendering-specific hacks.)

I've never seen the scrolling behavior in subtitles, though.  I think
they're only common in live captions.

In fact, that example of yours is really really confusing to me. I
&gt;<i> would much prefer if the text wasn't displayed on top of each other,
</I>&gt;<i> but at different locations on the screen - one to the right one to the
</I>&gt;<i> left, preferably underneath the people that speak. That is a better
</I>&gt;<i> experience. I believe that example of yours only looks that way
</I>&gt;<i> because somebody had to work around the problem that the subtitle
</I>&gt;<i> authoring format didn't allow for such explicit placement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The scene is jumping all over the place--at one point one pair is directly
*above* the other pair in the frame.  There's no left/right speaker
correspondance.  FWIW, I find it intuitive to read.

&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually, we will want to get rid of the legacy format and just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; deliver WebVTT, but they still need to display as though they came
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; from the original broadcast caption format for contractual reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what degree of sameness they expect, but as users can always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; override their font (implying different wrapping results, etc.), you'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never be able to guarantee that it'll look identical to the output of a
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixed format.  If captions have editing like the above, it could even
</I>&gt;<i> result
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a visible drop in quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the opposite is true. Right now, people work around some of
</I>&gt;<i> the ways in which they really would like to render their captions
</I>&gt;<i> because the formats don't allow for example explicit placement.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore we get poor quality captions right now. With the features
</I>&gt;<i> available, we should see better captions, not worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure (most of the time), but if the contracts you refer to require that
their content rendered with WebVTT look the same as they did in their
original format, that won't always be possible.
