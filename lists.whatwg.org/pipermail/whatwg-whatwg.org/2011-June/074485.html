It just means that the user's relevant cookies are included in the 
request.


&gt;<i> My opinion is that it should be the same for the XHR and EventSource and

They are.


&gt;<i> We currently generate Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* in the server 
</I>&gt;<i> responses for the XHR requests to allow cross-domain calls (and do not 
</I>&gt;<i> really do anything beyond that) and I hope it will not be broken with 
</I>&gt;<i> these new &quot;credentials validation&quot; changes.
</I>
For EventSource (and for XHR when withCredentials is set) you need to 
explicitly give the origin that was included in the request in the 
response, instead of just using &quot;*&quot;. Since EventSource is only useful when 
the server is dynamic, this isn't really a big deal. Just put the relevant 
logic in whatever script is generating the event stream.

It's all public:

I don't have a strong opinion on this (though I do think the concern that 
authors will shoot themselves in the foot if we don't have at least a 
small barrier here is a valid one). Currently, the changes to &lt;img&gt;, 
&lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, and EventSource are agnostic to this.


&gt;<i> That would also allow dropping the crossorigin=&quot;&quot; attribute which 
</I>&gt;<i> complicates the request model for the elements it is applicable to a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot. (Too much, in my opinion.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I designed CORS in such a way it could be used for &lt;img&gt; and such 
</I>&gt;<i> without the need to introduce new syntax.)
</I>
We still need crossorigin=&quot;&quot; actually because some sites break if you send 
an Origin: header on image requests.

</I>
EventSource doesn't really make much sense with credentials=false most of 
the time, so it seems simpler for authors to just not bother asking them 
to set it each time explicitly.

</I>
Custom request headers is defined unambiguously as &quot;A list of custom 
headers for the request. Empty, unless explicitly set&quot;. Since EventSource 
does not explicitly set it, it is empty for EventSource's purposes.

Ok. No change is require here then right?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The Cache-Control request header used with EventSource is not in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not sure what you mean by &quot;simple request headers&quot;. The Cache-Control 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; header isn't a custom header, so it doesn't affect whether you use a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preflight or not. I've clarified the spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, is Last-Event-ID also not a custom header then?
</I>
There are no custom headers here. Why would you think there are?
