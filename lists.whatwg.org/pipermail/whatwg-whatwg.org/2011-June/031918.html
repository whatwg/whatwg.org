Why are you assuming there's any client-side validation code involved?

&gt;<i> I'm not sure what do you mean by &quot;no one ever sees the actual URI&quot;: I

</I>
The URI is not displayed in the url bar unless the new page is shown. 
If the URI results in a file download, it won't be shown in the URL bar.

&gt;<i> Another question could be whether they _care_ about the URI.
</I>
They don't, of course.  But that's not even relevant in the &quot;generate a 
download based on form input&quot; case.

&gt;<i> By the amount of things it achieves: besides setting the filename
</I>&gt;<i> (which I consider only a minor benefit), it improves navigation and
</I>&gt;<i> helps SEO (see comments above).
</I>
I think you're assuming people care about SEO for the file to be 
downloaded....  In many cases they don't.

&gt;&gt;<i> That's great, and I'm happy you're willing to impose costs on your users so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you don't have to use it.  But others may wish to make different tradeoffs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here.

</I>&gt;<i> I'll assume that there has been a misunderstanding at some point,
</I>&gt;<i> because that last statement is already taking things too far from

</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully) clear way:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Most of my sites use some URI beautification techniques to aid both
</I>&gt;<i> user's and spider's navigation (with a significant effort to minimize
</I>&gt;<i> the impact on the users).
</I>
My point was that these techniques, as far as I can tell, impose a cost 
on the user, unless I'm completely misunderstanding how they work...

I agree that if you fix up URIs on form submit on client side that cost 
is pretty small in the common case.

&gt;<i> 2) Because of (1), I haven't had any need to ever use the filename
</I>&gt;<i> argument on a Content-Disposition header: my beautified URIs already
</I>&gt;<i> serve as good enough filenames.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Because of (2), I do not hold a strong opinion about how that
</I>&gt;<i> argument should be handled on the many different scenarios.
</I>
These two were clear, yes.
