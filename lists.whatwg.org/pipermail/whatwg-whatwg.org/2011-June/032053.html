There are two use cases here: styling the whole document, and styling a 
subpart of a document.

Styling a whole document by having style sheets in the middle of the 
document causes flickering (as the browser updates the styles), and is 
hard to maintain. So we make this non-conforming, to help authors avoid 
these pitfalls. (Indeed, it's never been conforming, this is not new.)

To distinguish this case from the subpart styling case, we use the 
&quot;scoped&quot; attribute for subpart styling. This is why that is conforming.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So putting a &lt;style&gt;, meant to be global, in the &lt;head&gt; simply isn't an 
</I>&gt;<i> option in many cases. Maybe such cases shouldn't exist, but they do.
</I>
Could you give more concrete examples? Unless someone is encoding data in 
style sheets, it seems that it is quite possible for the style sheets to 
be prepared ahead of time.


&gt;<i> There's a fundamental compatibility issue with &lt;style scoped&gt;. Existing 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers simply ignore the scoped attribute and apply the styles to the 
</I>&gt;<i> entire document. This is surely not what an author means when he uses 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;style scoped&gt; as per HTML5.
</I>
It's trivial to work around that using ID selectors in the interim.


&gt;<i> Suggestion: Drop &lt;style scoped&gt;. Instead, introduce a new attribute, say 
</I>&gt;<i> styleref, which is permitted for elements that allow flow content, or 
</I>&gt;<i> for any element (whichever is easier). The attribute would specify a 
</I>&gt;<i> space-separated list of CSS stylesheet URLs, to be applied inside the 
</I>&gt;<i> element.
</I>
That wouldn't solve the main use case: syndication. In that scenario, 
referencing external files is often a non-starter.

A system that cannot do this:

    &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;

but can do this:

   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;

Seems artificially limited and really should just be fixed.

If you can only affect some parts of the &lt;body&gt;, the site probably would 
also rather you didn't affect parts outside those parts by fiddling with 
them via CSS. And you can style the inside parts using &lt;style scoped&gt;. 
This seems handled pretty well by the current spec, in fact.

Just @import the common content. This is essentially equivalent to your 
proposal of using stylref=&quot;&quot;.


&gt;<i> By the way, there are undoubtedly cases where you would want to use the 
</I>&gt;<i> same scoped stylesheet for different elements, e.g. for different 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote&gt; elements quoting from the same source.
</I>
In that case, just put class=&quot;&quot; values on the &lt;blockquote&gt; and put the 
style sheets at the top level. No reason for something like scoped sheets 
in a case that simple.

I don't follow what you're saying here.


&gt;<i> Un-scoped stylesheets in &lt;body&gt; are currently supported by browsers. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is my main objection to using the &lt;style scoped&gt; syntax: it does 
</I>&gt;<i> not degrade gracefully by being ignored by &quot;old&quot; (i.e., all current) 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers but instead gets interpreted as a document-wide stylesheet, 
</I>&gt;<i> quite contrary to the author's intent and with potential disaster.
</I>
That actually is intentional. It means you can use it today in legacy UAs 
if you write your rules carefully.
