(Note that the spec has since changed on this; javascript: either runs in 
a browsing context that it is navigating, or it doesn't run at all.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; What does it do for those cases if it doesn't match the spec?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For &lt;iframe&gt; the behavior in Gecko currently is different in terms 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of what the URI of the result document of javascript: is set to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   data:text/html,&lt;body onload=&quot;alert(window[0].location)&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;javascript:''&quot;&gt;
</I>
Woah, funky. (Gecko thinks the location is &quot;javascript:''&quot;.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Note that there is some confusion here in terms of browsing contexts 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and &lt;object&gt;, since&lt;object&gt; does expose a Document object sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (but not others) and does participate in session history sometimes, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I believe... So I'm not quite sure what behavior the spec calls for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for&lt;object&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's defined; see the section on the&lt;onject&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've read that section, in fact.  I couldn't make sense of what behavior 
</I>&gt;<i> it actually called for.  Has it changed recently (last few months) to 
</I>&gt;<i> become clearer such that rereading would be worthwhile?
</I>
Not as far as I'm aware. Could you elaborate on how it is confusing? I'm 
eager to make this understandable!


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At least in Gecko, the return value string is examined to see 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; whether all the charcode values are&lt; 255.  If they are, then the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; string is converted to a byte array by just dropping the high byte 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of every char. So you can pretty easily generate image data this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If any of the bytes are&gt; 255, then the string is encoded as UTF-8 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hm. This currently isn't specced; the spec just assumes the return 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value is text/html string data and doesn't say what encoding to use. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a good way to test this in the context of an&lt;iframe&gt;, where 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all the browsers do something with javascript:?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body onload=&quot;alert(window[0].document.characterSet)&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;javascript:'\u0400'&quot;&gt;
</I>

Gecko: UTF-8 if the 'javascript:' URL includes characters &gt;255, ISO-8859-1 
if all the input characters are &lt;255.

WebKit seems to pick my default encoding regardless.

Opera returns &quot;&quot;.

IE8 returns &quot;undefined&quot;.

Since Gecko seems to be alone in this weird behaviour, I haven't specced 
it. I couldn't find any other effect (e.g. the input seems to always be 
treated as Unicode, not converted to bytes and redecoded, regardless of 
what I make it look like, including UTF-16 and UTF-8).

That's black-box equivalent to what the spec currently requires, I believe 
(though the spec implements it more like what Boris describes:).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Disclaimer: this is only my opinion on something that isn't really

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Of what has been brought up so far, javascript: as an inline 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; resource is not very useful at all, so IMO the only reason to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it would be for legacy compat. I'll follow up on this again once the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; change to block inline javascript: URLs in Opera has been in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; wild for a while, hopefully reporting that no compat issues have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; arisen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since only Firefox now supports this, I've removed support for it from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the spec. (It's just commented out for now; we can put it back if 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone makes a compelling argument.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great! I can report that the changes to block inline javascript: URLs

Excellent.
