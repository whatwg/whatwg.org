&gt;<i> Should it? Even when the book has no URL? If you expect urn:isbn:&#8230; to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Wikipedia and Amazon (among others) have all the mechanisms already.
Such ISBN handlers could even be registered by JavaScripts.

&gt;<i> Browsers currently treat &lt;cite&gt; just like &lt;i&gt; (except that it has a
</I>&gt;<i> different name). There is no sign of advance functionality emerging. It
</I>&gt;<i> does not matter how usable something is when it does not exist at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;Cite&gt; is not nearly as useful as @cite.

&gt;<i> I forgot to mention that the ISBN number should be included visibly in
</I>&gt;<i> the credits, especially because it is usually the simplest and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> the only reasonable way to identify a book unambiguously (and can be
</I>&gt;<i> copied and pasted into a suitable bibliographic search form). It&#8217;s
</I>So you're saying that users should rather search for the term ISBN,
select the following number, copy it, remove/add hyphens as necessary
and then paste it to a suitable bibliographic search form? Instead of
registering a suitable bibliographic search form once, and having the
user agent do the hard work in a click or two?

&gt;<i> metadata, but metadata that need not and should not be hidden but
</I>&gt;<i> presented in textual content. At most it might be included into elements
</I>&gt;<i> that are not initially displayed but become available when the user so
</I>&gt;<i> requests&#8212;possibly some day via the &lt;details&gt; element if browsers
</I>&gt;<i> implement it well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>But browsers need to be told that that number close to the quotation
is an ISBN. And if you always hide it in &lt;details&gt;, user agents may be
compelled to expand it by default, making it unusable for e.g. hiding
answers to a quiz.

&gt;<i> The cite attribute in &lt;blockquote&gt; should really be moved to the
</I>&gt;<i> non-recommended part of HTML. It hardly ever serves a useful purpose,
</I>&gt;<i> and it tends to mislead authors into including important information
</I>&gt;<i> _only_ in the attribute, which has no browser support worth mentioning
</I>&gt;<i> (despite having been in HTML for over 13 years).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Before you said &lt;cite&gt; was implemented as &lt;i&gt;, and your point is that
the cite attribute is useless? They're barely related, @cite contains
an URI, that an user agent might be able to use in an automated
fashion. &lt;Cite&gt; contains a human-readable name of a work. That'll
rarely be machine-readable.
