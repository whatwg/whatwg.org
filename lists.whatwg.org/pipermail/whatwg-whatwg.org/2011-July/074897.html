No, I don&#8217;t want to use them, since only about one person in a million 
would see the expression. There are several reasons to that, including 
the absence of those characters in fonts&#8212;the only commonly available 
font that contained a reasonable collection of Plane 1 characters was 
code2001, and it does not seem to be distributed by its author any more.

Characters not supported by any of the fonts installed in the user&#8217;s 
system don&#8217;t degrade well. The user sees a small box or the &#8221;&#65533;&#8221; 
character (which may appear due to other problems, too).

Comparing this with how well &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&#178; works, I don&#8217;t 
think anyone who understands the implications will give a second though 
to using such Plane 1 characters in HTML documents.

&gt;<i> Alternatively, you can use MathML to mark up the equation.
</I>
Or I could use LaTeX and get a presentation of acceptable quality. Or an 
image, as people still widely use. The question was about markup of 
physical quantities in HTML. Using other tools just to present a casual 
equation in running text would be disproportionate.

&gt;<i> Whether you want something in italics or not is more a matter for CSS than
</I>&gt;<i> a matter for HTML.
</I>
In many contexts, by long traditions and conventions, the use of italics 
is a matter of content, not casual presentation. When people know they 
cannot use italics, they are forced to simulating it (e.g., writing /a/ 
to denote italic &#8220;a&#8221;) or to avoiding the issue with clumsy methods like 
long prose explanations. Wouldn&#8217;t it be odd to pretend that in HTML, you 
are forced to something like that? After all, &lt;i&gt; has been with us since 
the dawn of HTML, and all browsers support it when they can use italics 
at all (and may use some special representation when not).

&gt;&gt;<i> Should we consider the var element as covering physical quantities too?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After all, they can be regarded as variables in a broad sense, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> symbols that denote different values in different situations. However,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;  would be odd, wouldn't it, since the symbol denotes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universal constant of nature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can look at it as being a variable whose value is a constant of
</I>&gt;<i> nature. I've clarified the spec to indicate that this is fine.
</I>
I don&#8217;t think you have clarified whether &lt;var&gt; is suitable for physical 
quantities, but I guess you meant to imply it&#8212;even though there is not a 
single example about markup for physical quantities.

On the other hand, it seems that it doesn&#8217;t really matter. The &lt;var&gt; 
element has now been defined to have such a wide and vague meaning that 
it is pointless to use it. There is little reason to expect that any 
software will ever pay attention to &lt;var&gt; markup on any semantic basis.

So authors will use &lt;i&gt; if they think italics is semantically essential, 
and &lt;var&gt; won&#8217;t be used much.

&gt;&gt;<i> A programming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language variable is something that is _not_ conventionally rendered in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> italics. Rather, they are usually (though for no really good reason)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendered in a monospace font, like any other expressions in computer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. And vectors are usually bold.
</I>
So why should authors be told to use markup that by default (and always 
when CSS is off) results in programming language constructs to be 
italicized? Flagging &#8220;placeholders&#8221; with italics (as in &#8220;issue the 
command &lt;kbd&gt;rm &lt;i&gt;filename&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt; to delete a file) is a widely used 
and understood style, but programming language variables are a 
completely different issue.

&gt;&gt;<i> Too bad there's no example of&lt;var&gt;  used in programming context. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current wording suggests that it would be normal, when discussing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programming, to write, say, &quot;Then we define the variable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;var&gt;myFoo&lt;/var&gt;  of type&lt;code&gt;fooType&lt;/code&gt;  with initial value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;code&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/code&gt;  - -&quot;, which really makes no sense, even if we use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both&lt;var&gt;  and&lt;code&gt;  for myFoo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why does it make no sense?
</I>
Because it implies that in default rendering, identifiers of variables 
appear in italics whereas identifiers of types or classes do not. Why 
would anyone use extra &lt;var&gt; markup when it has no other implications 
than requiring extra CSS code to remove (when possible) italics?
