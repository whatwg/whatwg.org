Having rel=attachment and download be named so differently implies that the functionality is different. For example, I'm sure that many people will waste time trying to see what they can do with @download on an iPhone that they couldn't do before with Content-Disposition.

For reference, this is how the warning looks: &lt;<A HREF="http://nypop.com/~ap/webkit/quarantine.png">http://nypop.com/~ap/webkit/quarantine.png</A>&gt;.

A browser can certainly find a way to put an arbitrary original URL here, but the behavior is not limited to browsers. Any application can use the download API, and non-browser applications will not necessarily have the notion of referencing page. Having different data depending on whether you download directly from a browser or using a download manager is of course no good.

That said, as long as we don't need to honor a file extension provided in @download when it doesn't match Content-Type, it may not matter very much if a page gets the chance to modify the base part of the name.
