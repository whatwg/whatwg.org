[sic] has an explicitly articulated meaning. Underlining, on the other 
hand, does not; it is an annotation but the reader cannot know, without 
context, what its meaning is.


&gt;<i> Anyway, aren't you saying that &lt;u&gt; says &quot;this text is annotated but no

</I>
The physical line is an annotation. It's just not articulated.


&gt;<i> But the whole idea of transmogrifying the old &lt;u&gt; element, one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> simplest elements of traditional HTML, to some purportedly semantic 
</I>&gt;<i> element without saying what it _really_ means, is just doomed.
</I>
Doomed in what sense? If you are concerned that people are going to use it 
for a different meaning that it has, then the whole language suffers from 
this problem and so calling this one out specifically as &quot;doomed&quot; seems to 
be a case of missing the wood for the trees.


&gt;<i> I wonder what speech-based user agents are supposed to make out of &lt;u&gt;. 
</I>&gt;<i> The good old &lt;u&gt; is simple: you can either ignore it (saying that 
</I>&gt;<i> underlining has no recognizable meaning that could be conveyed in 
</I>&gt;<i> speech), or you can interpret it as some kind of emphasis, expressed by 
</I>&gt;<i> a change of voice somehow. But if the new &lt;u&gt; is supposed to be 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic, can it be ignored in speech? How do you express an explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> but completely unspecified &quot;annotation&quot;?
</I>
If it's ok if it's entirely ignored, then it's presentational, and not 
conveying any useful information.

If it isn't ignored, then clearly it doesn't mean &quot;underline&quot;. Indeed, it 
means pretty much what HTML now says it does, and always has. A different 
voice, inflexion, auditory icons -- there are lots of ways of conveying 
this kind of thing in speech, just like there is in the visual medium.


&gt;<i> This really sounds like an odd game where HTML specs are meant to say to 
</I>&gt;<i> authors and to vendors of authoring software that they can keep using 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;u&gt; as before (and pass validation), but when interrogated, they are 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to tell that it does not mean underlining but... eh... explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> annotation without explicitly articulated annotation.
</I>
If you interpret the spec as saying that &lt;u&gt; is underline and it's fine to 
use it as before then you are misreading the spec.
