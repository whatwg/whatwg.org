I had a look at this to verify that it is black-box-equivalent to what  
Opera has implemented, and only discovered one issue:

&lt;div itemprop=&quot;&quot;&gt; should not be added to the .properties collection,  
because it has no properties. My bad for suggesting that the criteria  
should be the presence of an itemprop attribute, it should be an itemprop  
attribute containing at least one token. Can you update the spec to match?

(I implemented the spec'd algorithm pedantically in  
&lt;<A HREF="https://gitorious.org/microdatajs/microdatajs/commit/217cc34e7e679e2e4ea3e670a0dcdd155a7b9800">https://gitorious.org/microdatajs/microdatajs/commit/217cc34e7e679e2e4ea3e670a0dcdd155a7b9800</A>&gt;  
for verification, it passes the unit tests with said modification.)

WFM

</I>&gt;<i> an

</I>
WFM, but note step 3: &quot;Add a mapping from the item item to the subject  
subject in memory, if there isn't one already.&quot; Step 1 guarantees that  
there is no entry for item, so step 3 can be unconditional.

</I>
It's whatever problem &lt;<A HREF="http://schema.org/docs/extension.html">http://schema.org/docs/extension.html</A>&gt; is trying to  
solve, which is something like &quot;allow people to geek out with more  
specific vocabularies without interfering with search results&quot;. I whined a  
bit in  
&lt;<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/schemaorg-discussion/browse_thread/thread/6de3a1761b115271">http://groups.google.com/group/schemaorg-discussion/browse_thread/thread/6de3a1761b115271</A>&gt;,  
the short story being:

  * extensibility encoded with a microsyntax in the URL, making it  
not-so-opaque
  * such URLs make the DOM API less useful

Perhaps bending Microdata to accommodate for this is not the best idea. If  
I were schema.org, I would just encourage people to do this:

&lt;div itemscope itemtype=&quot;<A HREF="http://schema.org/Person">http://schema.org/Person</A>&quot;&gt;
   &lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
     &lt;div itemprop=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Arnold&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div itemscope itemtype=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/Governor">http://example.com/Governor</A>&quot;  
itemref=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
       &lt;div itemprop=&quot;state&quot;&gt;California&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Making extensions unsightly is probably a good thing, to discourage people  
 from going too crazy with it. This way it's also clear which properties  
only apply to the extended type.
