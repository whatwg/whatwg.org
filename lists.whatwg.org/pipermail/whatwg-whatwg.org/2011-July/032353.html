Excellent work, IMHO. I've added my own little +1 here: <A HREF="http://adactio.com/journal/4675/">http://adactio.com/journal/4675/</A>

Oli continues:
&gt;<i> I think the blockquote spec should be changed to allow the inclusion

</I>&gt;<i> a sentence like:
</I>&gt;<i>  &#8220;Block quotes may also contain annotations or attribution, inline or
</I>&gt;<i> in an optional footer element&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> This would change blockquote from being purely source content, to
</I>&gt;<i> being source content with possible metadata inline or in a footer.
</I>&gt;<i> However I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a problem, as these things increase the
</I>&gt;<i> value of the quoted content. I think a spec change is necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate common quoting practices.
</I>
This sounds good to me.

1) Oli has shown the real-world use cases for attribution *within* blockquotes. I know that the &quot;Pave the cowpaths&quot; principle gets trotted out a lot, but Oli's research here is a great example of highlighting existing cowpaths (albeit in printed rather than online material):

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#pave-the-cowpaths">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#pave-the-cowpaths</A>

&quot;When a practice is already widespread among authors, consider adopting it rather than forbidding it or inventing something new.&quot;


2) This is something that authors want, both on the semantic and styling level (i.e. a way to avoid having to wrap every blockquote in a div just to associate attribution information with said blockquote). I believe that the problem statement that Oli has outlined fits with the HTML design principle &quot;Solve real problems.&quot;

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#solve-real-problems">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#solve-real-problems</A>

&quot;Abstract architectures that don't address an existing need are less favored than pragmatic solutions to problems that web content faces today.&quot;


3) The solution that Oli has proposed (allowing footer within blockquote to include non-quoted information) is an elegant one, in my opinion. I can think of some solutions that would involve putting the attribution data outside the blockquote and then explicitly associating it using something like the @for attribute and an ID, but that feels messier and less intuitive to me. Simply allowing a footer within a blockquote to contain non-quoted material satisfies the design principle &quot;Avoid needless complexity.&quot;

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#avoid-needless-complexity">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#avoid-needless-complexity</A>

&quot;Simple solutions are preferred to complex ones, when possible. Simpler features are easier for user agents to implement, more likely to be interoperable, and easier for authors to understand.&quot;


4) Because the footer element is new to HTML5, I don't foresee any backward-compatibility issues. The web isn't filled with blockquotes containing footers that are part of the quoted material. Oli's solution would match up nicely with the design principle &quot;Support existing content.&quot;

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#support-existing-content">http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#support-existing-content</A>

&quot;The benefit of the proposed change should be weighed against the likely cost of breaking content&quot;
