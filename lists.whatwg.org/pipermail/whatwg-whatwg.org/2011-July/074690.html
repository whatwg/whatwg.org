<PRE>
In response to off-list feedback, I've renamed StreamTrack to 
MediaStreamTrack to be clearer about its relationship to the other 
interfaces.

</I>
This is fixed now, hopefully. Let me know if the fix is not sufficient.

(I replaces the videoTracks and audioTracks lists with a single tracks 
list in which you can enable and disable individual tracks.)


&gt;<i> I think a note would be appropriate that although the label on a 
</I>&gt;<i> GeneratedStream is guaranteed to be unique for the conceptual stream, 
</I>&gt;<i> there are situations where one ends up with multiple Stream objects with 
</I>&gt;<i> the same label. For example, if the remote peer adds a stream, then

</I>&gt;<i> Stream objects with the same label if a reference to the removed Stream 
</I>&gt;<i> is kept. Also, if the remote peer takes a stream that it receives and 
</I>&gt;<i> sends it back you will end up with a Stream object that has the same 
</I>&gt;<i> label as a local GeneratedStream object.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> We prefer having a StreamRecorder that you have to stop in order get the
</I>&gt;<i> recorded data (like the previous one, but with asynchronous Blob retrieval)
</I>&gt;<i> and we do not understand the use cases for the current proposal where
</I>&gt;<i> recording continues until the recorder is garbage collected (or the Stream
</I>&gt;<i> ends) and you always get the data from the beginning of the recording. This
</I>&gt;<i> also has to be tied to application quota in some way.
</I>
The current design is just the result of needing to define what happens 
when you call getRecordedData() twice in a row. Could you elaborate on 
what API you think we should have?


&gt;<i> The recording example does not seem correct either, it never calls 
</I>&gt;<i> record() and then it calls getRecordedData() directly on the 
</I>&gt;<i> GeneratedStream object.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> Instead of blob: we would like to use stream: for the Stream URLs so 
</I>&gt;<i> that we very early on in the media engine selection can use the protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> scheme to determine how the URL will be handled. Blobs are typically 
</I>&gt;<i> handled in the same way as other media playback. The definition of 
</I>&gt;<i> stream: could be the same as for blob:.
</I>
Why can't the UA know which blob: URLs point to streams and which point to 
blobs?


&gt;<i> In addStream(), the readyState of the Stream is not checked to see if it is
</I>&gt;<i> ENDED, in which case adding a stream should fail (perhaps throwing a TypeError
</I>&gt;<i> exception like when passing null).
</I>
The problem is that if we do that there'd be a race condition: what 
happens if the stream is ended between the time the script tests whether 
the stream is ended or not and the time the stream is passed to the 
object? I would rather that not be unreliable.

Actually, the spec doesn't currently say anything happens when a stream 
that is being transmitted just ends, either. I guess I should spec that...

...ok, now the spec is clear that an ended stream transmits blackness and 
silence. Same with if some tracks are disabled. (Blackness only if there's 
a video track; silence only if there's an audio track.)


&gt;<i> When a received Stream is removed its readyState is not set to ENDED 
</I>&gt;<i> (and no 'ended' event is dispatched).
</I>
I've clarified this so that it is clear that the state change and event do 
happen.


&gt;<i> PeerConnection is an EventTarget but it still uses a callback for the 
</I>&gt;<i> signaling messages and this mixture of events and callbacks is a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> awkward in my opinion. If you would like to change the function that 
</I>&gt;<i> handles signaling messages after calling the constructor you would have 
</I>&gt;<i> to wrap a function call inside the callback to the actual signal 
</I>&gt;<i> handling function, instead of just (re-)setting an onsignal (or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever) attribute listener (the event could reuse the MessageEvent 
</I>&gt;<i> interface).
</I>
When would you change the callback?

My concern with making the callback an event handler is that it leads to a 
set of poor failure modes and complications in the API:

 - It's easy to not register a callback, which makes no sense. There's 
   literally never a use for create a PeerConnection without a signaling 
   channel, as far as I can tell, so making it easier to create one 
   without a callback than with seems like a bad design.

 - It's easy to register multiple callbacks. This equally makes no sense, 
   and would likely only ever be the source of bugs.

 - It makes getting the data more complicated. Instead of passing the 
   callback the string to send, we end up passing an object which has on 
   it one attribute that contains the string.


&gt;<i> Perhaps signalingMessage() could be renamed to 
</I>&gt;<i> add/handle/process/SignalingMessage() or similar to better indicate that 
</I>&gt;<i> it is used to input signaling messages received from the other peer.
</I>
processSignalingMessage() works, I guess. I'm not a huge fan of overly 
long names, but Anant suggested making it clearer too, so ok. Done.


&gt;<i> There is a potential problem in the exchange of SDPs in that glare 
</I>&gt;<i> conditions can occur if both peers add streams simultaneously, in which 
</I>&gt;<i> case there will be two different outstanding offers that none of the 
</I>&gt;<i> peers are allowed to respond to according to the SDP offer-answer model. 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of using one SDP session for all media as the specification 
</I>&gt;<i> suggests, we are handling the offer-answer for each stream separately to 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid such conditions.
</I>
Why isn't this handled by the ICE role conflict processing rules? It seems 
like simultaneous ICE restarts would be trivially resolvable by just 
following the rules in the ICE spec. Am I missing something?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some problems however that a browser may face is what to do with urls

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the beginning (which would be needed for decoding encrypted, on-demand 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; audio) or start from the end (similar to `tail`, for live streaming 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; events that need decryption, etc.).
</I>
I haven't added support for this in the spec, but based on feedback from 
roc recently I renamed Stream to MediaStream to allow Stream to be used 
for precisely the purpose you describe. That would be something to add to 
the File API spec(s), though.


&gt;<i> I actually think moving to a streaming mode for file reads in general is 
</I>&gt;<i> desirable, but I'm not entirely sure extending Blobs is the way to go 
</I>&gt;<i> for *that* use case, which honestly is the main use case I'm interested

</I>&gt;<i> streaming file reads; hopefully we'll do a better job than other 
</I>&gt;<i> non-JavaScript APIs out there :) [1].  Blob objects as they are 
</I>&gt;<i> currently specified live &quot;in memory&quot; and represent &quot;in memory&quot; File 
</I>&gt;<i> objects as well.  A change to the underlying file isn't captured in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Blob snapshot; moreover, if the file moves or is no longer present at 
</I>&gt;<i> time of read, an error event is fired while processing a read operation.  
</I>&gt;<i> The object URL may be dereferenced, but will result in a 404.
</I>
Makes sense.


&gt;<i> The Streaming API explored by WHATWG uses the Object URL scheme for 
</I>&gt;<i> videoconferencing use cases [2], and so the scheme itself is suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> for &quot;resources&quot; that are more dynamic than memory-resident Blob objects. 
</I>&gt;<i> Segment-plays/segment dereferencing in general can be handled through 
</I>&gt;<i> media fragments; the scheme can naturally be accompanied by fragment 
</I>&gt;<i> identifiers.
</I>
Indeed.

Currently this isn't supported.

Can you elaborate on why you'd rather do this by hand instead of using the 
browsers' streaming features?


&gt;<i> I've also been looking at the WebRTC MediaStream API and was wondering

</I>&gt;<i>   readonly attribute MultipleTrackList audioTracks;
</I>&gt;<i>   readonly attribute ExclusiveTrackList videoTracks;
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>
I imagine we'll support something like this eventually, probably by having 
a new interface for author-generated streams, probably something like what 
roc suggests below, but we should probably get basic video and P2P streams 
working before adding something like this.

Right.


&gt;<i> I think the natural way to support the functionality you're looking for

</I>&gt;<i> because you can use those Blob URLs anywhere. An alternative would be to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a new kind of object representing an appendable sequence of Blobs 
</I>&gt;<i> and create an API to mint URLs for it.
</I>
Right.

The spec currently uses &quot;video user&quot; and &quot;video environment&quot;.

getUserMedia() returns a video stream, so it wouldn't use a flash.

getUserMedia() is intended to support returning multiple video tracks for 
this kind of thing. A video track could also just be natively 3D.
