&gt;<i> Firstly thank you (and you Jeremy!) for your input. This thread will

</I>Thank you for your commentary, it is most appreciated.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a can of worms as authors will want control over both content

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Datetimes will usually be presented in a localized format to humans.

&gt;<i> In the print use cases I found, sometimes attribution is inline after
</I>&gt;<i> the last sentence and sometimes on a following line. This is in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to having attribution in the prose surrounding the block
</I>&gt;<i> quote, as currently recommended by the spec. How would the user agent
</I>&gt;<i> know which way the author wants to present attribution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>By fetching and reading a linked stylesheet. I think it's easier to 
style attributes then text nodes polluted with delimiters such as &quot;from&quot; 
and &quot;by&quot; that make reordering hard.
More importantly, how is the author to know how the user wants 
attribution presented?

&gt;<i> Again I have no idea how a user agent would follow these rules.
</I>&gt;<i> Arbitrarily showing one thing in one viewport size and something else
</I>&gt;<i> at a different size would be a bug (arbitrarily meaning without

</I>A feature to one, a bug to another. The existence of the CSS height and 
width media features suggests that catering style to varying viewport 
sizes is desired by others than just me. I don't see why a user agent 
should seek an authors' permission to style a document for an unusually 
sized viewport, nor require users to write their own stylesheets instead 
of shipping customizable stylesheets.

&gt;<i> Love your phrase

</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> It's simply a question of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Lorem ipsum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;footer&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;kennitala:2112952019&quot; title=&quot;Bjartur Thorlacius&quot;&gt;Bjartur&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on&lt;time datetime=&quot;1997-4-2&quot;&gt;the second April, 1997&lt;/time&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/footer&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote title=&quot;Bjartur Thorlacius&quot; datetime=&quot;1997-4-2&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cite=&quot;kennitala:2112952019&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Lorem ipsum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You've got two additional problems in your example:
</I>&gt;<i> * currently only the&lt;time&gt;,&lt;ins&gt;  and&lt;del&gt;  elements accept the
</I>&gt;<i> datetime attribute, and this isn't even a valid datetime value (you
</I>&gt;<i> wanted 1997-04-02)
</I>Ops, you're correct; this should've been 1997-04-02. I'm proposing 
adding a datetime attribute to &lt;blockquote&gt;.

&gt;<i> * the cite attribute must be a valid URL, and is for providing a link
</I>&gt;<i> to more information about the quote (generally its source) &#8211; you can't
</I>&gt;<i> use it for non-URL data
</I>For a lack of a valid URI identifying myself, I used an unregistered 
uri-scheme (&quot;kennitala&quot;) and my national ID as the scheme-specific part. 
The exact URI in question is unimportant to the example, but I see no 
reason to restrict values of cite to locators only, as opposed to 
identifiers in general. Quoting books identified by ISBN numbers seems 
like a good enough use case to me.

&gt;<i> This proves Jeremy's earlier point about attributes being a bad place
</I>&gt;<i> to store data. Unless you look at the source you&#8217;d never notice these
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure I would, had I actually tried to, say, render them or validate 
before posting them on the Internet. I refrained from doing so as I knew 
this to be invalid markup, anyway. Where datetime to be a valid 
attribute of blockquote

&gt;<i> I also note that your&lt;footer&gt;  example contains a lot more content,
</I>&gt;<i> the visible part being &#8220;Bjartur on the second April, 1997&#8221;. A
</I>&gt;<i> potential rendering of the attributes in your second example would
</I>&gt;<i> probably be something like &#8220;Bjartur Thorlacius 1997-04-02&quot;, which I
</I>&gt;<i> think isn&#8217;t as good. This refers to my first point about authors
</I>&gt;<i> wanting to control the content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, that would be quite an odd rendering. More likely renderings:

It all depends on the user's localized stylesheet.

Note that a datetime in a &lt;time&gt; element would have to parsed just as 
date in a datetime attribute of a &lt;blockquote&gt;. They're both machine 
readable (and that's the best way to internationalize dates).
&gt;<i> Finally two other strikes against attributes are they're harder for
</I>&gt;<i> people learning HTML (which is one reason we have&lt;section&gt;  over
</I>&gt;<i> role=&quot;section&quot; etc), and we already have three (I&#8217;d argue) perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> good elements for the data you are suggesting adding via attributes:
</I>&gt;<i> *&lt;footer&gt;  for following-line attribution and notes
</I>&gt;<i> *&lt;time&gt;  for datetime information
</I>&gt;<i> *&lt;a&gt;  and&lt;cite&gt;  for citation information
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I've never heard this argument before. I thought we had &lt;section&gt; rather 
than &lt;div role=section&gt; because the latter has a high 
noise-to-information ratio, leading to overly verbose constructs such as:

&lt;div role=section&gt;
[content]
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- end section --&gt;

&gt;<i> There&#8217;s also the possibility of adding another inline element, such as
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;credit&gt;, which could let someone credit an author of a quote, or e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> to credit a photographer of an image together&lt;figure&gt;  and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;figcaption&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>So &lt;credit&gt; would be an inline version of &lt;footer&gt;, to be contained in 
&lt;q&gt;? Would it not be more consistent to use attributes, in that case? 
Note that &lt;figcaption&gt; may contain &lt;footer&gt;s.

&gt;<i> For the reasons Jeremy mentioned, I actually hope the cite attribute
</I>&gt;<i> gets dropped in favour of a visible, explicit form of attribution.
</I>&gt;<i> While something like&lt;a&gt;  and&lt;cite&gt;  in a&lt;footer&gt;  could work for
</I>&gt;<i> citation, I still don&#8217;t have a good idea about citing explicitly when
</I>&gt;<i> the citation is inline (on the last line of the block quote), or for
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;q&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I do: use the same attributes as for &lt;blockquote&gt;.
Referencing people as works as I did in my examples is probably
bad (read: terrible) style. There should be a sepearate @author 
attribute for attributing an author, distinct from the @cite attribute 
for citing the work.

On a third thought, using a &lt;footer&gt; child of &lt;blockquote&gt; doesn't seem 
so confusing after all, but it'd be even less confusing to HTML 
newcomers were it named e.g. &lt;credit&gt;. But then it would not be an 
appropriate element for &quot;fat footers&quot;, whatever they are. I don't see 
what citations and &quot;fat footers&quot; have in common.
The semantics of &lt;footer&gt; would be a lot clearer if &quot;fat footers&quot; were 
not to be enclosed in &lt;footer&gt;, but rather in &lt;nav&gt;s or &lt;aside&gt;s.

Were the &quot;fat footers&quot; example in the spec as follows, I'd have fewer 
objections.
