</I>
I believe I last responded to feedback on this topic in August last year:

   <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-August/028148.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-August/028148.html</A>

...with a minor addition in December:

   <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-December/029350.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-December/029350.html</A>

However, feedback since has introduced a new wrinkle that I do not believe 
was thoroughly examined in previous threads on the topic: the issue of how 
to specify an explicit filename, which is especially relevant for a number 
of use cases mentioned below.


&gt;<i> &lt;a download=filename.txt&gt; would have the effect of adding (or 
</I>&gt;<i> overriding) the header &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment; 
</I>&gt;<i> filename=filename.txt&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would mean I'd no longer need to use server-side hacks to cause 
</I>&gt;<i> Content-Disposition to be sent for download links, eg. where 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;?download=1&quot; adds the C-D header.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also just now had to implement a server-side script that receives 
</I>&gt;<i> base64 file data and a filename in parameters, and responds by echoing 
</I>&gt;<i> it back. That's an ugly hack to allow client-side data to be saved to 
</I>&gt;<i> disk, and doesn't work with serverless web apps.  This would be fixed, 
</I>&gt;<i> allowing both data: URLs and File API object URLs as download links.
</I>
This download=&quot;&quot; attribute seems like a reasonable idea.

It should always be up to the user to have the final say, but the use 
cases presented here suggest that it makes sense to at least give authors 
the opportunity to provide a hint as to what the default behaviour should 
be for links.


&gt;<i> Better yet, File API could have an API for writing blobs to files.

That would help for some of these cases, but not most. It would also mean 
that what could be expressible purely declaratively requires script, which 
is something we generally try to avoid. Declarative semantics are easier 
to process using static analysis tools, for instance.

Indeed, that should probably be addressed as well.

That prevents a single resource from being offered either for view or

Using the title=&quot;&quot; doesn't really work because what is appropriate for a

We can just say that if the attribute has no value it is indicating that 
the author recommends downloading the file. No need for redundancy.

None, presumably the same as &quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot; in the same

I haven't addressed this use case here, but it's definitely something we 
can investigate in the future if download=&quot;&quot; proves successful.

(Note that for same-origin cases, you can use Content-Disposition for this 
already. This would only really help with embedding images from other 
sites that don't support giving a filename, e.g. Flickr.)

This is easily solved by providing two links, or an iframe and a link. 
This is probably more usable than one link and expecting the user to 
right-click, too. As Ian says above, if the user is savvy enough to 
right-click, the user is likely not going to find it difficult to give the 
file a name either.

Well again, making sure you don't put an extension on a file that does
not correspond to the type of the resource as reported by the third-party 
site seems like an elementary precaution.

The disparity of behaviours amongst file managers on Unix systems is

I don't think it's obvious. In particular, there is a big difference 
between how a link with a download=&quot;&quot; attribute could be processed 
compared to how a regular hyperlink could be processed: in the latter 
case, the UA only knows it's going to be a download some way into 
processing the navigation request (and after some irreversible steps like 
aborting other downloads); in the former case, we can bypass all that and 
just do a direct download without navigating to the resource.


A number of people raised issues relating to download=&quot;&quot; confusing the

(Jonas questioned some of the premises above, but not Adam's basic points

In fact, using CORS here seems like it would _add_ a vulnerability: it 
would mean that any site that wants to allow another site to let the user 
download a file from that site can in addition simply read the file! Given 
the huge amount of concern we have shown over the possibility that authors 
will accidentally set CORS headers on too many pages, this sounds like a 
very dangerous thing to be encouraging.

</I>&gt;<i> In order for the links to work (assuming the links appear in context in

Indeed.

Is there any reason to use CORS here at all? It seems like the simpler 
solution would be the following:

 - If download=&quot;&quot; is set, then by default trigger a download rather than a 
   navigation action. (User can override via context menu.)
 - Pick a filename for the download as follows:
   - if the received resource has a Content-Disposition: attachment header 
     that specifies a filename, use that.
   - otherwise, if the received resource has a Content-Disposition header 
     that specifies a filename, and the resource is same-origin, use that
     filename.
   - otherwise, if the received resource is same-origin and the 
     download=&quot;&quot; attribute specifies a filename, use that.
   - otherwise, if the received resource has a Content-Disposition: 
     attachment header and the download=&quot;&quot; attribute specifies a filename, 
     use the filename from the attribute.
   - otherwise, if the received resource is same-origin then derive a 
     filename from the resource.
   - otherwise, either abort or alert the user that a file is being 
     downloaded from a different origin and prompt for a filename.
 - If a mapping from the MIME type to an extension is known, but the 
   filename doesn't have that extension, add it.

This is what I've used for now (modulo some allowances for user 
interfaces), but I welcome suggests for changing this.

One thing this doesn't handle is the case of a resource on the server not 
having a known type, and the download=&quot;&quot; filename (or indeed the URL 
itself) having a potentially dangerous extension (like .exe). I figure 
this is no more dangerous than the server having the right type in this 
case, if the right type is a dangerous type.

It's not quite that simple. If your site is an HTTPS site, and you link to 
an HTTP site, then the downloaded resource musn't be trusted as much as 
your site, since it could have been tampered with in-flight.

This implies the hosting service has to prevent pages from including 
download=&quot;&quot; attributes pointing to itself, of course.

Which URL is given there of course depends on what URL the browser decides 
to put there. It could be the page's URL.
