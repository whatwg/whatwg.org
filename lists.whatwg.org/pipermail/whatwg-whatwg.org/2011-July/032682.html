</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's inconsistent in that all other objects in javascript stringify to

</I>
[PutForwards] doesn't affect that, that's the stringifier. Location, &lt;a&gt;, 
and &lt;area&gt; all already have stringifiers, as do lots of objects in JS.

Are we really concerned about objects stringifying to &quot;[Object Foo]&quot;?

It seems that the usefulness of such stringification is far outweighed by 
the usefulness of being able to treat the attribute as a string attribute 
like any other reflecting attribute while also being able to use methods 
on it. In fact, it is consistent with every DOMString attribute: they 
don't stringify to &quot;[Object String]&quot;, yet you can call methods on them. 
What's the difference?


&gt;<i> If the concern is that link.sizes should be consistent with other 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute-mapping properties then you're only half-way there since 
</I>&gt;<i> typeof tests still behaves differently.
</I>
I'm not particularly concerned about such edge cases (who does typeof on 
reflecting attributes in a way where the difference here would matter?). 
It's the common use that I'm concerned about.


&gt;<i> I definitely agree that the way SVG does it is not ideal. How about 
</I>&gt;<i> simply creating a second property, like link.parsedSizes which returns 
</I>&gt;<i> the tokenlist?
</I>
That's what we're doing (for legacy reasons) with className/classList and 
rel/relList, but I consider that an ugly and unfortunate wart on the API. 
As much as possible, attributes that take space-separated lists are using 
DOMSettableTokenList to avoid this (including a few legacy ones that 
aren't as high-profile as class and rel).

All the space-separated lists are exposed this way. It would be rather odd 
to exclude just one on the basis that we couldn't think of a reason why 
this particular one would get changed much.
