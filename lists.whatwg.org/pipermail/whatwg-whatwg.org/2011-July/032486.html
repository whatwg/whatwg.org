</I>&gt;<i> So the Google Chrome implementation is in error here, right?
</I>
No, it's exactly right. You are confusing the UI with the submitted value.

That is a risk, it is true.

Indeed.

Per spec, yes.

Of course, it would be a pretty poor user experience. But that's just a UI 
issue. What it _should_ do is magically guess what the user meant and just 
do the right thing. Failing that, an approximation based on the user's 
preferences and locale, and the page's locale and style sheets.

</I>&gt;<i> the state to, say, &quot;number&quot;, and when successful, removing the 
</I>&gt;<i> instructions (or replacing them with some different instructions).
</I>
Indeed.

Much discussion on this topic happened when we started on this work in 
2004 and 2005, I highly recommend perusing the archives around that time.

Indeed. To solve this, we need help from CSS. That's one of the reasons we 
created &lt;output&gt; in HTML.
