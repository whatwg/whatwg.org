<PRE>2011/7/15 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> I really don't see the importance of the &quot;name the thing that isn't going
</I>&gt;<i> to be downloaded&quot; usecase; there are countless edge cases that we could
</I>&gt;<i> concern ourselves with in HTML but that few users will ever hit, this is
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A common case is generated PDFs, which are regularly both saved to disk and
viewed in-browser (eg. tax forms which are viewed to print and then saved
for records).

 (I also suspect a user sophisticated enough to actually save something,
&gt;<i> e.g. right click save as, is sophisticated enough to be able to type their
</I>&gt;<i> own filename.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As a user sophisticated enough to enter a filename, I still want the browser
to do it for me.  &quot;The user can do it by hand&quot; isn't an argument for
requiring them to.

You don't always need to &quot;right click save as&quot;, either.  For example, a user
with no browser PDF support will generally receive a window like Firefox's
&quot;open with/save as&quot; prompt, which should also be able to use this as a hint,
without forcing users *with* browser PDF support to save to disk.
Similarly, dragging to the desktop, dragging into other applications, batch
downloading (eg. via DownThemAll), and so on.

I think it's better overall to keep the semantics as clean and simple as
&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think combining orthogonal concepts is clean or simple.  It seems
like a step back from Content-Disposition, where these concepts are already
cleanly separated.

(Sorry for pressing this point, since I don't feel extremely strongly about
it, but I just felt these arguments against it were a bit weak.)


2011/7/15 Darin Fisher &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">darin at chromium.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> URLs (that are not backed by a single file).  This is valuable to me
</I>because
&gt;<i> I can imagine wanting to save the contents of a &lt;canvas&gt;, and that
</I>probably
&gt;<i> involves saving the data URL that you get from toDataURL().
</I>
You'd probably want Canvas.toBlob and FileSaver for this, once both are
implemented.
