</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be rather trivial. The string &#8220;ISBN&#8221; followed by

</I>&gt;<i> resource _if_ you have some mechanism(s) for mapping ISBN numbers to URLs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key issue is whether browser vendors have interest in it and which
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism(s) would be used. After all, an ISBN could be in a multitude
</I>&gt;<i> of ways, like querying an online bookshop, querying an online
</I>&gt;<i> bibliographic system, or querying an site of books in digital format
</I>&gt;<i> online. Which one should be used? Would it be useful? To be really
</I>&gt;<i> useful, it should be handled so that the browser checks what it can get
</I>&gt;<i> using the ISBN and then make that information available to user (how to
</I>&gt;<i> get bibliographic info, how to read reviews, how to buy the book, how to
</I>&gt;<i> borrow it in a library, download or read the book via the net for free
</I>&gt;<i> or for fee).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s much used in the wild, except on pages by
</I>&gt;<i> organizations that define HTML specs. What might be the motivation for
</I>&gt;<i> browsers to do something special with it? Surely you could make things
</I>&gt;<i> so that by clicking on a blockquote, the user accesses the resource
</I>&gt;<i> pointed to by the cite attribute. Browsers could do that, and so could
</I>&gt;<i> authors. But would users actually start clicking on quotations to see
</I>&gt;<i> their sources? Surely they would far more probably click on the title of
</I>&gt;<i> a work in visible credits if present and if it is a link, so what would
</I>&gt;<i> the cite attribute help?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good point

&gt;<i> No, it&#8217;s not a category thing. It&#8217;s about the relativity of being
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;machine-readable.&#8221; You are probably thinking of data in a specific
</I>&gt;<i> format designed to be easily parseable and useable by computer software,
</I>&gt;<i> such as a URL, an ISO 8601 date notation, or an XML tag. But browsers
</I>&gt;<i> already do many kinds of heuristics, parsing data that doesn&#8217;t really
</I>&gt;<i> match the specs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You *could* interpret handwritten text on a piece of paper using a 
machine and parse it as HTML. I'm not volunteering for making a machine 
for that task.

&gt;<i> A title of a work is easily useable by software: put it inside quotation
</I>&gt;<i> marks and throw it at Google, and the odds are that you get some useful
</I>&gt;<i> links related to it, if there&#8217;s info on the work (and perhaps the work
</I>&gt;<i> itself) on the web at all. Well, assuming that the title is relatively
</I>&gt;<i> unique.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> Titles of works are often more useful in the long run than URLs. URLs
</I>&gt;<i> change far too often when sites are revamped or for other reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ISBNs are more useful in the long run than titles. Good titles get 
reused far too often.

&gt;<i> I think a good start would be to add an optional (but usually
</I>&gt;<i> recommended) &lt;credits&gt; or &lt;source&gt; element for use inside &lt;blockquote&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What about the common case of multiple quotations credited to the same 
source (interleaved with comments).
