Robert O'Callahan posted a good response:

In short, the better solution isn't to ask for permissions up-front, but 
to ask for fewer permissions. The ideal solution is to not ask for any 
permission but to base the permission on a natural user gesture. For 
example, drag-and-drop of files to a site doesn't require permissions, but 
it is an implicit permission grant. Same with &lt;input type=file&gt;. With 
getUserMedia() we are doing something similar: instead of asking for 
permission, the user is asked for a specific input to be selected.

Permission grants are a bug.

</I>
Indeed. The system shouldn't ask for any permissions. For example instead 
of reading contact data, it could cause the OS to pop up a contacts list 
from which you can pick a contact to give access to it to the app.

</I>
My proposal for notifications was to have them default to being just 
inside the page (nothing that a &lt;div&gt; couldn't do), but that they would 
include explicit UI to promote them to full-system notifications; and 
vice-versa, so a system notification could be demoted back to just in-page 
notification with a similar gesture.

That doesn't work. It might be appropriate for Bing Maps to have access to 
my Geolocation information, but I certainly don't want some random blog to 
have access to it. Defaults don't work here.

</I>
There's no need for the app to know. It can just allow the user to upload 
a photo, and the browser can offer to use the webcam.



I haven't added anythign to the spec in relation to this proposal.
