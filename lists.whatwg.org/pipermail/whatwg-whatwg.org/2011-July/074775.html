Pardon? The issue is browser support to urn:isbn:&#8230;, not mechanisms that 
map ISBNs to some URLs in some system.

&gt;&gt;<i> Browsers currently treat&lt;cite&gt;  just like&lt;i&gt;  (except that it has a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not matter how usable something is when it does not exist at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Cite&gt;  is not nearly as useful as @cite.
</I>
&lt;cite&gt; is useful for using italics in a manner that makes you feel more 
structural. The cite attribute is completely useless unless you set up 
some processing of your own, just as a site could use for the foobar 
attribute (or data-foobar)

&gt;<i> So you're saying that users should rather search for the term ISBN,
</I>&gt;<i> select the following number, copy it, remove/add hyphens as necessary
</I>&gt;<i> and then paste it to a suitable bibliographic search form?
</I>
No, I&#8217;m saying that a proper quotation cites a book unambiguously, and 
ISBNs are a useful tool there and should then appear in content proper, 
not hidden in an attribute that browsers ignore. It&#8217;s wishful thinking 
to say that cite attributes magically turn ISBN numbers to cool queries 
or links. If a browser, or some client-side JavaScript, can do something 
like that to a cite attribute, it could equally well do that to content 
like &#8220;ISBN&#8221; followed by a number of a certain type. That would be much 
more useful.

&gt;<i> But browsers need to be told that that number close to the quotation
</I>&gt;<i> is an ISBN.
</I>
The string &#8220;ISBN&#8221; is sufficient evidence of that.

&gt;<i> Before you said&lt;cite&gt;  was implemented as&lt;i&gt;, and your point is that
</I>&gt;<i> the cite attribute is useless?
</I>
Yes.

 &gt; They're barely related,

They are both supposed to be used for citations. I think &lt;cite&gt; is 
actually used quite a lot, though not always consistently, whereas the 
cite attribute mostly occurs in W3C and related documents.

 &gt; @cite contains
&gt;<i> an URI, that an user agent might be able to use in an automated
</I>&gt;<i> fashion.
</I>
Might be able, but doesn&#8217;t. Can you mention one browser that actually 
does something useful with it? And it isn&#8217;t a particularly new feature 
in specifications; browser vendors have had plenty of time to implement it.

&gt;<i> &lt;Cite&gt; contains a human-readable name of a work. That'll
</I>&gt;<i> rarely be machine-readable.
</I>
HTML documents are always machine-readable. (Well, you _might_ just 
write HTML on a paper with a pen&#8230;)

Association of a URL of the quoted work with a blockquote element is not 
_required_. Human-readable indication of the quoted work and its author 
is a legal requirement as well as a matter of appropriateness, so it 
should have priority over any kind of linking. When there is markup for 
such indications, and even now that there isn&#8217;t, you can always _link_ 
to the quoted work&#8212;if you have something to link to.
