</I>
The challenging use case, and one that we had trouble with when we prototyped the Contacts API, is for ongoing or persistent access.  The best approach we have right now is to use explicit markup to &quot;sandbox&quot; the permissions grant away from untrusted code.

In the Contacts case, for example, autocomplete of email addresses, names, and phone numbers was a desired use case.  A naive approach is to let the web app read the entire database and perform autocompletion in content.  The safe approach, which was harder and less flexible, is to attach autocomplete behavior to input type=&quot;tel&quot; and &quot;email&quot;, and to set the autocompleted value only when the user has selected it.

There are definite UX limitations to that approach - the content can't provide visual hinting during the autocomplete, for example (it would be nice if a photo gallery could trim down the set of photos from my friends as I narrow in on the name).  The limitations create an incentive for content to try to get the full set of data anyway, through some other channel.  As Roc commented, finding a way to be comfortable with a higher-level permissions grant that persisted over a longer span could be one way to address that.
