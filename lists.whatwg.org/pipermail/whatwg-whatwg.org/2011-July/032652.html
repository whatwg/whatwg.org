</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&amp;&amp; offsets[offsets.length - 1] &lt; currentOffset +

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;results.push([treeWalker.currentNode,
</I>&gt;<i> offsets[offsets.length - 1] - currentOffset]);
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;offsets.pop();
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;}
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;currentOffset += treeWalker.currentNode.length;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;}
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;return results;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably buggy, but something like that should work. &#160;(And hey, it's
</I>&gt;<i> 19 lines, good guesswork.) &#160;Granted, if you wanted to do any kind of
</I>&gt;<i> normalization it would be more complicated to author, but also more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated to spec. &#160;So I don't see really a use-case here that's
</I>&gt;<i> strong enough to justify this, if we can get rid of it.
</I>
There's also the perennial problem of dealing with non-visible text
(c.f. Selection.toString(), innerText), which some browsers handle (a
quick tests suggests WebKit searches non-visible text and Firefox
doesn't). Also, don't forget that you're in the habit of writing this
sort of code. Knocking that kind of code out quickly is beyond what a
large percentage of web developers are capable of.


&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed. My number two feature (well, it would make the top 5, at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least) would be removing the restriction on execCommand() only working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on editable content. This very use case shows that its usefulness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extends beyond editable content. The temporarily-switch-designMode-on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workaround is ugly, and destroys the selection in some browsers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said elsewhere, I disagree. &#160;Wanting to only modify editable
</I>&gt;<i> content is an important use-case. &#160;It's easy to emulate the behavior
</I>&gt;<i> you want if that restriction is in place (temporarily turn on
</I>&gt;<i> designMode), but nearly impossible to emulate the opposite behavior if
</I>&gt;<i> it's not built in to start with. &#160;If execCommand() worked on any
</I>&gt;<i> content at all, then text editors would be permanently forced to use
</I>&gt;<i> iframes with designMode instead of being able to use contenteditable,
</I>&gt;<i> just to avoid the user randomly bolding or deleting interface text.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it would mean that (for instance) execCommand(&quot;delete&quot;) works
</I>&gt;<i> differently from the backspace key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If turning designMode on destroys the selection in some browsers,
</I>&gt;<i> that's a bug that can easily be fixed, and doesn't justify a change to
</I>&gt;<i> the spec. &#160;Changing specs to work around easily-fixed browser bugs
</I>&gt;<i> makes much less sense than just fixing the bugs. &#160;The only
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantage I see to requiring this is that it's error-prone: the
</I>&gt;<i> obvious way to do it is to turn designMode on and then turn it off,
</I>&gt;<i> which will have an unexpected side effect if it had already been on.
</I>&gt;<i> But that's a minor issue, and I don't see a good way to avoid it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why exactly do you not want to turn designMode on and off, other than
</I>&gt;<i> easily-fixed browser bugs? &#160;What do you think is &quot;ugly&quot; about it?
</I>
I absolutely agree that restricting mutation to editable content is
important. My issues with using designMode are a combination of side
effects and implementation quirks in current and older browsers, which
I agree doesn't justify a change to the spec, and a gut feeling that
it's the wrong approach. There is no reason why your algorithms can't
work on non-editable nodes, so why require the user to change such a
fundamental property of the DOM (even temporarily)? I'd prefer an
alternative mechanism for specifying whether a command should apply to
only editable content that is part of the editing API. In my
execCommand implementation, it's specified as a property of an options
object passed to execCommand(). If that's not an option, another
command could be used, similar to the styleWithCSS command, to switch
between modes. applyToNonEditable, or something.
