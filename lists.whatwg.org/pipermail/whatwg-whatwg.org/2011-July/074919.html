nice recap and clarity on implicit vs explicit permissions. the concept of asking for permission and how to manage this would seem to remain open for explicit permission grants, the most pressing case being geolocation. might there be more use cases in future? this may open the case for more universal management mechanism through the UA, and potentially a generalized specification?

yes, possibly permissions should be viewed not in terms of the resource they may require to access (webcam, mic, printer, etc) but the conceptual user interaction - image\video source, audio source, document serialization, etc...

possibly the interaction should not be with the system but the browser. this leaves any system-level integration in full control of the browser and restricts the specification to a single level of abstraction.

</I>
the UI concept is that of user preference management, it can apply to permissions, confirmations, or any other user configurable setting.

there is no reason geolocation can't be managed in the same way. if i always want bing maps to have access to my location, it would be nice to be able to register that preference. for some random blog that always asks for my location, it would be nice to block it from asking again.

it's not defaults, but in-process persistent configuration.

indeed.

&gt;<i> I haven't added anythign to the spec in relation to this proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
the proposal for a web app descriptor for implicit permissions would seem to be debunked, however the greater question of how to manage the explicit geolocation feature is both still open and an issue being encountered today. 

what concerns me is the interaction between web application\document and browser shell\chrome which is new territory. the concept of background web pages, introducing notification requirements, is also an area requiring active attention.
