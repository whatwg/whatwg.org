I don't think that's really acceptable, but see below.

Well, it would behave differently from Gecko, for sure.  Have you tested 
any other UAs?  As in, do you have any evidence that &quot;some&quot; is not &quot;all&quot; 
in that sentence?  Also, how are you defining &quot;legacy&quot;?  Is it the same 
as &quot;existing&quot;?  ;)

&gt;<i> but there really is not interoperability with such file URLs
</I>
Is that a guess, or do you have data that you're forgetting to present? 
  Serious question....

&gt;<i> Some legacy user agents also support URLs such as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (5) <A HREF="file:///c|/foo">file:///c|/foo</A> which is considered equal to (3). I have no idea why
</I>&gt;<i> the pipe is considered better character than colon here.
</I>
Such URIs were used commonly back when various things that processed 
URIs went into conniptions when they saw the ':' reserved character, iirc.

In fact, at one point there were UAs that supported the version with '|' 
but not with ':'.  And hence there was content that used that syntax.

And again, what's needed here is data on which UAs do what, not generic 
statements about &quot;some&quot;.
