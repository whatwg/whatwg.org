</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require this to be included anyway.  It will also help with backwards 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility to have the style available.  For example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img style=&quot;width: 10em&quot; src=&quot;image-320x200.jpg&quot; set=&quot;image-320x200.jpg 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 320 200 10k, image-640x400.jpg 640 400 40k, image-1280x800.jpg 1280 800 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 150k&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The dimensions here are in image pixels, not CSS pixels.  The set would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> include the 'src' image to give the declared image pixel size. The byte 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> size and perhaps height could be optional.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Inlining the style here doesn't help. You don't know how many pixels &quot;em&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> means at the time of parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other cases, browsers could either delay loading the image or lookup 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 'src' image in the set to obtain the declared image pixel size and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use this to speculatively load an image (once the image viewport size is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finalized the browser could then decide if a higher resolution image is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed and load it then if necessary).  Browsers will need to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prepared to reload a higher resolution image anyway in case of zooming 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zooming in post-load is a rare case compared to the case of an image being

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> images, where currently the browser has no idea which to use.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Could you give a real example of this kind of thing? I'd love to study

</I>&gt;<i> For this one you really want the image whose dot width is the _device_ CSS

</I>&gt;<i> about zooming, but do care about resizing. If you care about zooming more 
</I>&gt;<i> than latency, you really just want the highest-res image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In practice you'd probably have a medium-size image for legacy cases, a 
</I>&gt;<i> low-size image for phones, and a high-size image for high-density big 
</I>&gt;<i> devices, and would invoke them as follows (ish):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   srcset=&quot;low.jpeg 400w 1x, medium.jpeg 800w 2x, medium.jpeg 1600w 1x, high.jpeg 2x&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...or some such. I agree that it's suboptimal for this specific scenario, 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that it means there's an editing hazard, but it doesn't seem so 
</I>&gt;<i> bad that we should redesign the feature or add more features to it at this 
</I>&gt;<i> time. If it turns out to be so common that we should support it (easily 
</I>&gt;<i> detected by seeing how many people are listing the same URL multiple times 
</I>&gt;<i> in srcset=&quot;&quot;), we can add support for this later.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Image cropping and centering is something best left to JS 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> algorithms.  Fluid cropping and centering may need an algorithm that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> takes into account particular areas of interest and focus within an 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> image, and user choices which would be better handled within the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> webpage and not at the browser level.  A web gallery may allow 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visitors to choose to scale versus crop images and to pan cropped 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> image.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Actually panning and so on would presumably best be done using

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of image crops.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those are trivial crops in comparison to visitors chosing to scale, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Btw &lt;canvas&gt; is not necessary for panning and cropping, the image can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> positioned through styling and this can be modified by JS based on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buttons or mouse movement etc.

Could you expand a bit more on the &#8220;cost&#8221; of an approach that might account for this?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>
Certainly not more so than manipulating strings, having done both frequently myself.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I actually have one use case that would benefit from having separate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements instead of an attribute &#226;&#8364;&#8220; replacing &lt;source&gt; elements with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consider that any attribute microsynthax would introduce a burden on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmatic DOM manipulation, as the attribute would have to be parsed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separately. &#226;&#8364;&#382;Do X for every &lt;source&gt; child element&#226;&#8364;&#339; is cognitively

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question &#226;&#8364;&#8220; different from other mental models used in HTML &#226;&#8364;&#8220; in your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are plenty of attributes with more complicated syntaxes, e.g. all 
</I>&gt;<i> the event handler attributes (whose syntax is JavaScript), or style=&quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> (whose syntax is CSS). See also &lt;meta content&gt; for many of the pragmas, 
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;area coords&gt; attribute, &lt;ins datetime&gt;, media=&quot;&quot; attributes, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Saying &#8220;there are worse things&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make much of a case for a worse thing. Better that we focus on finding the best possible approach here and avoid our previous mistakes.

&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, introducing an API would not help the use case of just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parsing HTML in, say, Python, to programatically download all images 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from a page (or something like that).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but for that case you just need to write a library once (just like 
</I>&gt;<i> you only need to write an HTML parsing library once).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This reminds me that ATOM &lt;enclosures&gt; have a byte length. Surfing via 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mobile, I certainly know that I would like images to show if they can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloaded in a reasonable time &#226;&#8364;&#8220; but I want to skip 5MB photos.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that newer mobile networks are actually faster than the networking a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of people in the US have to their house, I don't know how much of a 
</I>&gt;<i> lifetime such a feature would have.
</I>
This seems incredibly specific to privileged browsing contexts, and hardly a standpoint that accounts for the millions of users in developing countries accessing the Internet from mobile devices alone. Users with limited bandwidth and a per-kilobyte economic cost for access to a resource that&#8212;by very design&#8212;is meant to be open and accessible to users of any context. Tim Berners-Lee can speak to that far better than I ever could.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a) using the 'monocrhome' MQ to serve gray scale images to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> black-and-white printers or e-ink displays. Displaying a color image 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on a monochrome display does not always work well, as two different 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> colors of similar luminosity would be impossible to distinguish in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> monochrome environment. I expect this need to grow together with the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> extra verbosity of my syntax gets you an extra bit of clarity,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that there's a small learning curve, but it seems pretty easy

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one-attribute solution with terse syntax, but the cons of the terse 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> syntax are small whereas the cons of the multiple-element syntax are 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> immense. For the multi-element solution to be a net positive over the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one-attribute solution, the magnitude of its &quot;pros&quot; would have to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enormous.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

Perhaps, given the lack of clarity on this point, we might consult the opinion of authors.

Should we site examples of sites that grab/manipulate the value of an img tag&#8217;s src? Speaking of bandwidth costs: that would make for an exceedingly long email.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then gets blown up to an unattractive level.  The 1600.jpg file should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be identical to the 800.jpg file, just higher resolution, so delivering 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it instead would be ideal, but the current syntax doesn't allow that, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nor does it allow any reasonably reliable way for a browser to detect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it would be okay to serve the 1600.jpg image either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure how best to solve this, but John Mellor suggested
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowing the specification of the image's native dimensions somehow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That way, the browser could know that the 1600.jpg image is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate to serve as an 800px wide high-dpi image, or a 1600px wide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low-dpi image.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is possible to address this by repeating the same image at a larger
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> breakpoint, like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img srcset=&quot;800.jpg 1x 1599w, 1600.jpg 2x 1599w, 1600.jpg 1x&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, this means you're duplicating data, and have a chance of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failing to update all of the urls when you update one.  It also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> becomes more hostile as future screens arrive with higher resolutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, if 3x screens showed up, one would have to write the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following to serve things in the most ideal manner:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img srcset=&quot;800.jpg 1x 1599w, 1600.jpg 2x 1599w, 2400.jpg 3x 1599w,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1600.jpg 1x 2399w, 2400.jpg 1.5x 2399w, 2400.jpg 1x&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At this point it's just silly, and very error-prone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, when there's 3x displays, this could get to the point where we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to solve it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the current displays, it's just not that big a deal, IMHO.

Perhaps we should skate to where the puck will be, rather than where it is now.
