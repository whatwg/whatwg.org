</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; college did use my social security number as an ID number, but not in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; web forms as far as I remember.)  But in Israel, and I assume some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; countries, there are national ID numbers that are considered public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; info.  E.g., my Israeli id number (mispar zehut) is 332752187.  It's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; printed on my checks and things like that, so it's no secret, and since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it's guaranteed to exist and be unique, various institutions use it for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; login instead of or in addition to a username -- my bank, health
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; insurance provider, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't added this yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also haven't added:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - payment instrument type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - payment instrument start date
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - payment instrument issue number (for Maestro)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also haven't removed, as some people suggested, the three cc-name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subfields.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm open to making all these changes, but figured I would get some more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input on them first, in particular from Ilya who did the research to come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with the original set of fields.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen a relatively high number of Chrome bug reports requesting
</I>&gt;<i> better handling of (e.g. government) ID numbers.  One example: [
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=64433">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=64433</A> ].  I think it
</I>&gt;<i> would be helpful to add these to the spec; though as subsequent posters
</I>&gt;<i> have noted, there's a lot of potential complexity in how these should be
</I>&gt;<i> represented.  This might fall under the broader class of &quot;identity&quot;-related
</I>&gt;<i> fields, which I think merit their own carefully thought out set of tokens.
</I>&gt;<i>  There was some work done on the beginnings of such a specification -- see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity-inputs">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity-inputs</A> -- but my current understanding
</I>&gt;<i> is that this is an area in need of further development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The payment instrument type is almost certainly appropriate to add -- it
</I>&gt;<i> is included on almost every website that I've encountered that includes
</I>&gt;<i> payment card fields.  It was an oversight on my part to omit it from the
</I>&gt;<i> initial proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other two payment instrument field types I haven't encountered on the
</I>&gt;<i> Web, as far as I can recall.  So, based on my data set accumulated while
</I>&gt;<i> working on Chrome Autofill, I'm ok with leaving these out of the spec for
</I>&gt;<i> now.  However, my experience is biased toward US websites; it's possible
</I>&gt;<i> that these fields are more prominent internationally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The three cc-name subfields are split out surprisingly often on existing
</I>&gt;<i> websites.  I was initially opposed to including these in the spec; but that
</I>&gt;<i> data in support of them was overwhelming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I have gotten a request to include a field type for bank account
</I>&gt;<i> numbers, though I have only seen this info actually requested on a small
</I>&gt;<i> handful of extremely prominent (and generally trusted) websites: Amazon,
</I>&gt;<i> PayPal, and I think Google Wallet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
David Holloway reminded me that bank account numbers are also commonly
requested when filling out United States tax forms.  I have seen this
information requested for tax returns on [ <A HREF="https://turbotax.intuit.com">https://turbotax.intuit.com</A> ];
and David pointed me to [
<A HREF="https://gate.link2gov.com/sfpropertytax/PropertySearch.aspx?TaxType=Secured">https://gate.link2gov.com/sfpropertytax/PropertySearch.aspx?TaxType=Secured</A> ],
which allows you to pay be e-check and asks for your bank account's routing
and account numbers.
