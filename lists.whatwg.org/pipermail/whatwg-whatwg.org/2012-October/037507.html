I apologize for overemphasizing your involvement. It seems that it would have been more appropriate to call it the Hixie spec.

That WHATWG as a forum did not vet nor develop a public consensus about the proposal; it's the work of a single author in contrast to earlier Canvas specifications. It recommends, it does not document.

I appreciate your continued collaboration with Hixie, I am sorry I mischaracterized it on this and other forums.

At this point, it does seem appropriate to call it a proposal. No vendors have implemented the changes.
