Indeed, as with many cases where there are multiple ways to implement 
something, the different implementation strategies have different 
tradeoffs.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're aware of this technique, but it has a couple of obvious issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. It requires us to create a duplicate canvas, possibly using many MB

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; geometric regions. And performance won't be terrible if you implement 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some spatial hashing, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. It doesn't allow for sub pixel testing. In your algorithm above, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only one region can be at a pixel (which also means it isn't our 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard drawing code with anti-aliasing). Consider a zoomed canvas, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where we might want more accurate hit testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't thess problems go away if you use an OpenGL/DirectX backend to

</I>&gt;<i> (ie <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/faq/technical/selection.htm">http://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/faq/technical/selection.htm</A>)
</I>
That would be one of the possible implementations, as far as I can tell.

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;work&quot;. Can you elaborate?


&gt;<i> It is clear that mouse move events can be used, but will developers be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to detect and make use of click events on backed regions?
</I>
The spec doesn't distinguish between the types of mouse events. See the 
section starting around here:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-mouseevent-region">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-mouseevent-region</A>

</I>&gt;<i> In this case unbacked regions can be used to designate interactive

</I>
The specification describes a mechanism by which hit regions that do not 
have explicit controls are indistinguishable to the user from regions that 
do have explicit controls (and indeed, from any other element in the DOM).

See the section in the spec that starts &quot;Each hit region should be handled 
in a fashion equivalent to a node in a virtual DOM tree&quot;.

In particular, this means that accessibility tools that use a separate 
accessibility tool focus (e.g. the VoiceOver focus), and touch devices 
that provide haptic feedback, should work fine. Users who are keyboard- 
bound but unable to use an accessibility tool are screwed, but then 
they're screwed anyway since not everything that's interactive is 
focusable even at the best of times. :-( (I speak as one such user.)
