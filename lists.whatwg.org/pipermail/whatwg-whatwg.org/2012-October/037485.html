Summary: I've changed rel=noreferrer so that when it creates a new 
top-level browsing context, it doesn't clone sessionStorage. Turns out 
that as specced, it already did everything else that was needed.

The key part of this is:

|<i> Many web apps open untrusted links in new windows, such as mail clients 
</I>|<i> that allow users to click on links in email messages. These apps often 
</I>|<i> want to avoid any detrimental effects from opening the untrusted page, 
</I>|<i> such as script calls that try to manipulate or infer things about their 
</I>|<i> window.opener, or slowdowns from being rendered in the same process of a 
</I>|<i> multi-process browser.
</I>
This is already possible with rel=noreferrer.

This is already possible using rel=noreferrer to create a new browsing 
context without a name.


&gt;<i> As a result, I think these are also necessary features:

This is already the case for rel=noreferrer, as far as I can tell, 
assuming that...

&gt;<i>  + have the new page be in a new browsing context
</I>
...it's a new browsing context (e.g. target=&quot;_blank&quot;).


&gt;<i>  + have &quot;window.opener&quot; not be set
</I>
This is already the case for rel=noreferrer.


&gt;<i>  + have the window.name of the new page be set to &quot;&quot;
</I>
This is already the case unless you explicitly set one. But actually, even 
if you do, nothing forces the user agent to make it accessible, since the 
spec says that they're only accessible if &quot;the user agent determines that 
the two browsing contexts are related enough that it is ok if they reach 
each other&quot;, and the UA can easily decide not to allow it if the tabs 
aren't &quot;directly reachable browsing contexts&quot; in the spec's terms.


&gt;<i> Secondary goals:
</I>&gt;<i>  + have the sessionStorage not be cloned for the new page's browsing
</I>&gt;<i>    context
</I>
Interesting. Done.


&gt;<i> Anti-goals:
</I>&gt;<i>  + have the referer header be cleared on the load of the new page
</I>
(Discussed below.)


&gt;<i> &gt; Does this need to be done from window.open()?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  For example, Gmail uses window.open() for the links in emails, but 
</I>&gt;<i> would like the links to open in an unrelated context.
</I>
(Discussed below.)


&gt;<i> &gt; From &lt;a href&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  For example, links to switch between apps within a domain would be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful to have open in an unrelated context (e.g., the black bar at the 
</I>&gt;<i> top of Google pages).
</I>
rel=noreferrer supports this.


&gt;<i> &gt; From &lt;form action&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know of any immediate use cases for this, but it might be nice 
</I>&gt;<i> for consistency.
</I>
I haven't supported this. In general, &lt;form&gt; doesn't support rel=&quot;&quot; 
features.


&gt;<i> &gt; Is this a symmetric feature?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by symmetric here.  The page opened in 
</I>&gt;<i> the unrelated context may also be able to open pages in another 
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated context.
</I>
I meant &quot;is access blocked in both directions&quot;, as in, the new page can't 
see the original page and vice versa. The answer seems to be yes.


&gt;<i> &gt; At a more fundamental level: what are the use cases here? Is it just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-mail clients that want to open links?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Links in email clients is one use case.  For user agents that can open 
</I>&gt;<i> such links in a different event loop, another use case is to allow 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple independent apps under the same domain to run in parallel, even 
</I>&gt;<i> when opening one app from another.  (For example, Chrome could open 
</I>&gt;<i> links to different Google apps like Search, Maps, Mail, etc, in 
</I>&gt;<i> different processes.)
</I>
For these use cases, blocking referrers seems like a good thing, or at 
least not a problem.

</I>
Yeah, if you set the name you're not going to necessarily have as good a 
separation. If you want this to work well, use target=&quot;_blank&quot;.


&gt;<i> 2) What would be the behavior of a rel=unrelated link with target=

</I>&gt;<i> 3) What about the same with target= pointing to an existing window? 
</I>&gt;<i> Would that window become isolated? What would happen to the 'back'

</I>
It drops the referrer, but that's all, basically.

&gt;<i>

</I>
Browsers can do that if they want, but a new browsing context implies a 
new session history and I think it'd be really confusing for a link to 
seem to work like any normal link except it neuters the back button, or 
otherwise makes the history act in a special way.

</I>&gt;<i> the same named window within a single unit of related browsing contexts.
</I>
I haven't changed this, but it doesn't seem that unreasonable. Does anyone 
have any tests of this? In particular, do browsers really guarantee that 
you can reach _any_ browsing context in a unit of related browsing 
contexts? Or is it sometimes more strict than this? Is Gecko going to 
change in the other direction, making things tighter? Is Chrome, in the 
case of reused processes? Charlie even suggests that Safari, IE, and Opera 
allow different unrelated windows to find each other; if that is the case, 
it's not clear that the spec should change since that puts all the 
browsers on the side of matching the spec. :-)

(If we change this (change &quot;related enough&quot; to &quot;in the same unit of 
related browsing contexts&quot;), then even a named browsing context, assuming 
the name is new and doesn't end up referring to an existing window, would 
be cut off in the way we're describing above regarding event loops.)

I'm happy to make the spec not match implementations, if the 
implementations are going to change to match the spec. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; Firefox appears to allow cross-origin windows find each other by name.

</I>&gt;<i> This is actually necessary for web compat, last I checked, if the

The spec enumerates a set of cases where it's ok.

Agreed.

These are different use cases than the GMail case.

Even better is to just use a real link and have the user really click it. 
No need for script-initiated anything, then.

Ok.

There's still a real link in this case, though, no? So you can call 
.click() on it. (Or use accesskey=&quot;&quot;...)
