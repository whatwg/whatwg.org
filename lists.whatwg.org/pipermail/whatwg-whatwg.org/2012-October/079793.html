That is as may be, but:

1)  Every single other UA implemented the global scope polluter in 
standards mode.

2)  The spec called for it to be implemented in standards mode. 
Repeated requests that the spec be changed got denied with &quot;see point 1&quot;.

3)  Repeated requests for other UAs to drop support for the global scope 
polluter in standards mode were met with either silence or great 
surprise that Gecko had the behavior it did, followed by silence.

4)  The growing number of web developers who only bother testing in 
WebKit meant that there were more and more sites that were breaking in 
Gecko due to relying on the global scope polluter.

5)  Other browser vendors were putting out conformance and performance 
tests that relied on the global scope polluter to function.

I decided it wasn't worth punishing our users further if no one else in 
the world cared about this.
