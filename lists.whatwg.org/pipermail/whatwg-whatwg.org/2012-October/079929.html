 &gt;&gt; It might be better to declare &lt;title&gt; optional but strongly recommend

 &gt;
 &gt; That's basically what the spec says -- if there's a higher-level protocol
 &gt; that gives a &lt;title&gt;, then it's not required. It's only required if
 &gt; there's no way to get a title.

My point is that the title may be irrelevant, rather than specified 
using a higher-level protocol.

 &gt; Are there any situations that this doesn't handle where it would be
 &gt; legitimate to omit a &lt;title&gt; element?

Perhaps the simplest case is an HTML document that is only meant to be 
displayed inside an inline frame and containing, say, just a numeric 
table. It is not meant to be found and indexed by search engines, it is 
not supposed to be rendered as a standalone document with a browser top 
bar (or equivalent) showing its title, etc.

The current wording looks OK to me, and it to me, it says that a title 
is not needed when the document is not to be used out of context:

&quot;The title element represents the document's title or name. Authors 
should use titles that identify their documents even when they are used 
out of context, for example in a user's history or bookmarks, or in 
search results.&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-title-element">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-title-element</A>

Authors may still wish to use a &lt;title&gt; element in a document that is to 
be just shown in an inline frame, but it is comment-like then. I don't 
think it's something that should be required (even in a &quot;should&quot; clause).
