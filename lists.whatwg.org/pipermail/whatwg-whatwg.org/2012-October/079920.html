<PRE>Hi Ian,

I just wanted to make sure everyone is clear that this &lt;maincontent&gt; part
&gt;<i> is not part of the HTML specification, and is not a WHATWG specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ian is right, this is not part of the WHATG HTML specification, it is an
HTML extension specification that I am developing through the W3C HTML WG
with the aim of progressing the extension to a point where it can be folded
back into HTML 5.0 if it meets the CR exit criteria or HTML 5.1. And i
guess that if it is implemented that it will also become part of the WHATWG
HTML specification.

I have mailed the WHATWG list and asked for feedback on it as this is
where  some HTML standards developers and some implementers participate.


In the case of &lt;maincontent&gt;, there is no problem to be solved, and there
&gt;<i> is no use case that isn't already adequately handled by HTML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There are  use cases, and there is as much of a problem to be solved as
there was for the addition of header/footer etc, but you do not agree that
they are valid which, is fine, other people think they are valid.


This is not new information:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/state-of-the-web/2005/classes">https://developers.google.com/webmasters/state-of-the-web/2005/classes</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

It is new information,  its data about the use of id's not classes, there
is no data on id's in the documents you linked to. there is also no data in
the linked ocuments about the relationship between id values and their use
as targets of 'main content' links or data about the relationship  between
the use of role=main and such id values.

Also its fresh data from 2012, not 2005.


Site 1 uses id=&quot;main-nav&quot; where it could use &lt;nav&gt;, id=&quot;main&quot; where it
&gt;<i> could use &lt;article&gt;, and has multiple &lt;div&gt;s for styling that would not be
</I>&gt;<i> removed if we added one more element regardless of its semantics, and uses
</I>&gt;<i> id=&quot;content&quot; but doesn't need to to achieve its style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Site 2 uses id=&quot;main&quot; where &lt;article&gt; would be suitable, class=&quot;main&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and class=&quot;content&quot; for cases where a broad &quot;main content&quot; semantic would
</I>&gt;<i> not be, and has multiple divs with IDs such that adding a semantic for its
</I>&gt;<i> element with id=&quot;content&quot; wouldn't solve the problem of needing &lt;div&gt;s for
</I>&gt;<i> its style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Site 3 uses id=&quot;content&quot; where &lt;aside&gt; or &lt;article&gt; would be appropriate,
</I>&gt;<i> uses an &lt;a&gt;, of all things, to wrap ads that could arguably be &lt;article&gt;s
</I>&gt;<i> in their own right, and uses &lt;div id=&quot;main&quot; as part of a cascade of &lt;div&gt;s
</I>&gt;<i> for stylistic reasons (I don't understand its use of 'overflow' to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve its effect, but I find it hard to believe that it's necessary...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Site 4 has elements with id=&quot;content&quot;, &quot;left_main&quot;, &quot;right_main&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;comment_main&quot;, etc, and styles its id=&quot;content&quot; element in a way that
</I>&gt;<i> could just as easily be achieved without the element being present at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, this page has deep &lt;div&gt; stacks that again wouldn't be resolved just
</I>&gt;<i> by taking away one of the &quot;main&quot; layers into its own element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Site 5 has multiple elements that could be considered to wrap the &quot;main
</I>&gt;<i> content&quot;, with such &lt;div&gt;s nested at least five deep at one point
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;content&quot;, &quot;rightside&quot; (where the &quot;right&quot; side is the main part of the
</I>&gt;<i> page), &quot;module&quot;, &quot;module_body&quot;, &quot;chuxing_div&quot;...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What you are saying does not invalidate the uses case for a &lt;maincontent&gt;
element.the examples illustrate a correlation between the use of the cited
id's on an element that is used as a container for the main content of a
page, and a high correlation between the  use of such id's being used with
role=main and as the target form 'skip to main content' links. i.e as a
useful semantic identifier.

There are sections of the page that can legitimately be marked up, for
&gt;<i> which we've now got &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;. Those tend to be unambiguously recognisable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The data strongly suggests that there is a section of the  page that can be
identfied as the main content area, which tends to be unambiguously
recognisable.

It should be noted that while I provide the links to the source for the
data I provided. there is no such provision in the data you cite from 2005
from which you based the inclusion of various structural elements.
