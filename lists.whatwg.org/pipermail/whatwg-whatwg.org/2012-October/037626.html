I haven't added this, because contenteditable=&quot;&quot; is only truly useful with 
scripting enabled, and it's basically one line of script to support 
shunting the current value into a hidden input. This becomes especially 
more relevant when contenteditable is used for editors that don't just 
upload HTML; for example, the Google+ editor is contenteditable=&quot;&quot; but 
it's not going to upload the HTML, it uploads structured data.

Incidentally, it seems to use a WebKit-specific &quot;plaintext-only&quot; value. 
Should we spec that? Aryeh? It's filed as:

   <A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14554">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14554</A>

If this should involve changes to HTML, let me know.

Indeed.


&gt;<i> I'd suggest supporting &lt;textarea type=&quot;text/html&quot;&gt; with a built-in HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> wysiwyg editor if any UA wants to support HTML editing without 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript. In that case, the UA should provide a scriptable method for 
</I>&gt;<i> detecting for native support of type=&quot;text/html&quot;. As a result, a CMS 
</I>&gt;<i> system could fallback to e.g. TinyMCE or CKeditor to emulate the missing 
</I>&gt;<i> support.
</I>
This is actually what old versions of IE did (as &lt;htmlarea&gt;, IIRC), but it 
was dropped. I don't fully understand why, but I'm skeptical of 
introducing a new control for this without making sure we don't make the 
same mistakes, which means figuring out what those mistakes were.

</I>
Given how easy it is to copy data into a hidden &lt;input&gt;, why isn't that 
sufficient? It would actually be pretty difficult to come up with an API 
that is simpler than declaring an &lt;input&gt; and settings its value...

This is something else that just already works with &lt;input type=hidden&gt;.
