Let's have that fight separately.  ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> 2)  <A HREF="file://">file://</A> URIs are parsed as a &quot;no authority&quot; URL in Gecko.  Quoting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IDL comment:

</I>
Same as the comment I quoted?  As same as something else?

&gt;<i> I have not introduced a &quot;no authority&quot; concept however. The parser in
</I>&gt;<i> the specification also preserves the host as other user agents seem to
</I>&gt;<i> preserve it.
</I>
Well, the Gecko parser preserves the host at this stage assuming the URI 
was correctly formatted with a host.  Again:

   <A HREF="blah://foo/bar">blah://foo/bar</A> =&gt; <A HREF="blah://foo/bar">blah://foo/bar</A>

The interesting things happen when you have 0, 1, or 3 slashes between 
':' and &quot;foo&quot;.  The handling of &quot;foo&quot; after this point is a separate issue.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4)  For &quot;no authority&quot; URLs, including <A HREF="file://,">file://,</A> on Windows and OS/2 only, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what looks like authority section looks like a drive letter, it's treated as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of the path.  For example, &quot;<A HREF="file://c:/">file://c:/</A>&quot; is treated as the filename
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;c:\&quot;.  &quot;Looks like a drive letter&quot; is defined as &quot;ASCII letter (any case),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> followed by a ':' or '|' and then followed by end of string or '/' or '\\'&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure why this is checking for '\\' again, honestly.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this part of URL parsing or part of doing something with the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting URL?
</I>
In Gecko, it's part of URL parsing.  More precisely, it's part of the 
normalization performed as part of constructing a &quot;URL&quot; object from a 
string.  Since this is also how we parse URLs, it's effectively all part 
of the package.

But note that it would be a bit odd of <A HREF="file://c:/">file://c:/</A> claimed to have a host 
of &quot;c&quot; with a default port or some such...

&gt;&gt;<i> 5)  When parsing a &quot;no authority&quot; URL (including <A HREF="file://">file://</A>), and when item 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above does not apply, it looks like Gecko skips everything after &quot;<A HREF="file://">file://</A>&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up until the next '/', '?', or '#' char before parsing path stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the host is dropped?
</I>
In Gecko, I believe so, yes.  I'm not saying this is desirable; just 
what Gecko does.

&gt;&gt;<i> 6)  On Windows and OS/2, when dynamically parsing a path for a &quot;no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authority&quot; URL (not sure whether this is actually web-exposed, fwiw...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gecko will do something involving looking for a path that's only an ASCII
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> letter followed by ':' or '|' followed by end of string.
</I>...
&gt;&gt;<i> 7)  When doing URI equality comparisons
</I>...
&gt;&gt;<i> 8)  When actually resolving a <A HREF="file://">file://</A> URL
</I>&gt;<i> These points do not seem to be about parsing, correct?
</I>
Well, point 6 is about parsing, sort of.

7 and 8 are not, though at some point we'll need to define equality 
comparisons anyway.
