Hi everybody!

Serializing a complete HTML document DOM to a string is surprisingly
hard in javascript. As a fairly seasoned javascript hacker I figured
this might do it:

  document.doctype + document.documentElement.outerHTML

It doesn't. No browser has a useful window.DocumentType.prototype that
returns either the original document's &lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt; before parsing ?
or a semantically equivalent post-parsing one. Google Chrome shows one
in its devtools, but seems not to export some way of getting at it to
programmers.

My proposal is we specify this more useful behaviour for
javascript-running browsers, so it does become as simple as above. A
rough sketch of how a polyfill might implement the latter
window.DocumentType.prototype.toString:

  <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/3977584">https://gist.github.com/3977584</A>

Even as a polyfill, the above is rather limited, though:  I believe
only Firefox implements &quot;internalSubset&quot; today, and probably only in
XML contexts. The most useful implementation would IMO be a native one
that reproducing the doctype, as it was formatted in the source
document.

Thoughts?

This seems lossy in many cases (most obviously: when the HTML uses 
conditional comments, though there are also various XHTML-specific issues).

That might be worth doing independent of the serialization issue.

There were plans to put in on DocumentFragment. But IIRC no other browser
vendors voiced an interest and Hixie was opposed because he thought it
would encourage people to do more string-based DOM building. The WebKit
patch for this floundered as a result. I still think it's a good idea.

If you know the document is always going to be in the no-quirks mode, then 
you can just stick &quot;&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;&quot; at the start. If you need to be able 
to tell what the mode is but are ok with ignoring the &quot;limited quirks&quot; 
mode, then you can use document.compatMode to pick whether to use that 
string or none, as in:

   (document.compatMode == 'CSS1Compat' ? '&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;' : '') +
   document.documentElement.outerHTML

That will drop any comment nodes around the root element, in case that 
matters. If you want to get the actual DOCTYPE strings, you can make a 
simple serialisation function for doctype nodes that uses the three 
attributes on that object to string together the full thing (much as you 
do in the polyfill you mentioned).


&gt;<i> I believe only Firefox implements &quot;internalSubset&quot; today
</I>
Since the &quot;internal subset&quot; has no meaning in text/html, that's ok if your 
goal is just to be semantically equivalent.

What's your use case, exactly?

That was a different plan, but yes, there have also been proposals to do 
that. This was in the context of templates; a better solution to which has 
since been worked on in public-webapps.

</I>
Would it be possible to allow web site to request high priority / RT on
the expense of getting explicitly limited time slice?

For example, API could be something like

		setMaxLatency(latency)

where latency is desired maximum latency in ns. The return value could
be maximum time slice in ns. If the worker (repeatedly) went over it
maximum time slice, the UA should then revoke the high priority / RT
scheduling from said worker and post some kind of event to worker to let
it know about the issue.

This would prevent any RT worker from hogging the CPU 100% but any well
written worker code could be run with very low latency.

Notice that the worker can only request desired latency and UA will then
tell how much CPU time the worker is allowed to use each slice. The UA
should simply return zero if the requested latency is too low to
implement. (In this case, the worker would logically always overrun its
time sclice and would be re-scheduled back to normal latency.)

You're right, I agree. I think the user agent should stay on top of the
situation and monitor the CPU usage and adjust the priority accordingly.
However, I think the feasible options for getting the benefits of high
priority when needed are either a) that we treat the priority the developer
asks a request rather than a command, or b) the user agent detects the
intent (in the case of audio I think it'd be fairly simple right now) and
decides a suitable priority while adjusting it if necessary. To me, b)
seems like the best approach to take, although both approaches have the
advantage that they don't guarantee anything and are thus more amendable.

Very true, it can indeed be used to cause harm, and we should not allow
that. I ignored this because I was thinking about attack vectors as a
bidirectional thing (someone loses, someone gains), and I couldn't think of
a way the attacker would benefit from freezing random users' computing
devices. But this approach admittedly doesn't work that well on the web.


&gt;<i> The way the Web platform normally gets around this is by having the Web

</I>

Indeed it is non-trivial to specify, and while the Web Audio API attempts
to do this, it can't possibly cover all use cases without custom processing
in place, the spec is already huge and only addresses a limited set of use
cases efficiently. When the use case requires the developer to do custom
processing, it shouldn't cause the developer to lose all the advantage from
having the rest of the audio graph in a real time thread. Currently it
does, because the JS processing runs in a non-RT thread, and the results
would be too unpredictable if the RT audio thread waited for the non-RT JS
thread, so the current approach is to instead buffer up the input for JS,
send it in for processing and apply it for the next round, which means that
adding a custom processing node to the graph introduces the latency of at
least the buffer size of that custom processing node.

Cheers,
Jussi
