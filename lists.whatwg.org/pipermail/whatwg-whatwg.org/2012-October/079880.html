You mean, people putting extra properties on things like Object.prototype
or DOMStringMap.prototype, and breaking code doing for(a in {})?  I don't
find that to be a problem: that's nuts, so I don't do it.

It probably wouldn't hurt to actually prevent this from happening in the
first place, though, which I think is what you're suggesting below.

Unless the suggestion is that Object.getPrototypeOf(query.values) === null?
&gt;<i>

That, or making the prototype immutable, as if Object.freeze was called on
it.

To avoid putting object-like access and member methods on the same
interface.

I just want to make sure that if we're not using the native getter/setter
syntax, we're doing it for the right reasons.  The argument for &quot;never
exposing any APIs that require proxies to implement in JavaScript&quot; seems
weak.  &quot;APIs shouldn't both act like dictionaries and have other methods on
the same object&quot; is a good idea (and not a new one), but that's a smaller
set.

Maybe it's not worth having two interfaces (URLQuery and whatever
query.values is called) to avoid that--I don't know if that adds a lot of
complexity--but that's a separate question.

(And you reversed get()/set() right?)
&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah.


&gt;<i> It was a more limited version of this interface (the problem with
</I>&gt;<i> length was more about what would happen if you would add such a
</I>&gt;<i> member):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Don't do that--if an object acts like a dictionary, it should have no
members of its own.


&gt;<i> I don't know about JavaScript Map as to whether that would be reusable
</I>&gt;<i> in some way. We have some special requirements from last thread:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Keys can have more than one value.
</I>&gt;<i> * Keys are ordered behind the scenes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it is reusable that would be great. I guess Web IDL then needs to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
FWIW, map apparently doesn't yet have iteration (according to
<A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map</A>),
which I assume is wanted here.

Where would extra WebIDL hooks be needed--isn't this just a regular WebIDL
interface to line up with?
