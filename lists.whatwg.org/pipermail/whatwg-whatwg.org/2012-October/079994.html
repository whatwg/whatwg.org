Same as you quoted.


&gt;<i> Well, the Gecko parser preserves the host at this stage assuming the URI was
</I>&gt;<i> correctly formatted with a host.  Again:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="blah://foo/bar">blah://foo/bar</A> =&gt; <A HREF="blah://foo/bar">blah://foo/bar</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The interesting things happen when you have 0, 1, or 3 slashes between ':'
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;foo&quot;.  The handling of &quot;foo&quot; after this point is a separate issue.
</I>
Those are handled the same as in Gecko (also matches Safari I think,
Chrome strips are starting slashes (like if you have four), but I did
not copy that).


&gt;<i> In Gecko, it's part of URL parsing.  More precisely, it's part of the
</I>&gt;<i> normalization performed as part of constructing a &quot;URL&quot; object from a
</I>&gt;<i> string.  Since this is also how we parse URLs, it's effectively all part of
</I>&gt;<i> the package.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But note that it would be a bit odd of <A HREF="file://c:/">file://c:/</A> claimed to have a host of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;c&quot; with a default port or some such...
</I>
Maybe I should introduce a &quot;file host state&quot; that supports colons in
the host name (or special case the &quot;host state&quot; further, but the
former seems cleaner). Most browsers seem to fail currently on input
such as &quot;<A HREF="file://c:/">file://c:/</A>&quot; but this is on a Mac so maybe that's the
difference. I would prefer having the parsing be consistent though.


&gt;<i> 7 and 8 are not, though at some point we'll need to define equality
</I>&gt;<i> comparisons anyway.
</I>
Yeah, I guess at some point someone would need to write a processing
file: URLs specification (for post-parsing operations). On the other
hand, it's not entirely clear to me that needs to be interoperable.
