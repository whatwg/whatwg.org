</I>
Done.

I think that ship has sailed, what with there being multiple 
implementations of the old way.

Interesting idea.

I've made supportsContext() take the same arguments as getContext(), but 
obviously &quot;-webkit-allowswiftshader&quot; would be a proprietary value so it's 
not specced.

Obviously browser vendors can do what they want... but one would guess 
that at least Apple won't do that since they requested the feature for the 
very purpose of not doing that. So this:

&gt;<i> This does not really solve anything.

...seems like unwarranted cynicism. :-)


&gt;<i> Also, realistically, any web app actually interested in using WebGL will 
</I>&gt;<i> first create a WebGL context, and if that fails then fall back to

</I>
Well there's still a use case for feature-test code pre-emptively figuring 
out what is supported, presumably.


&gt;<i> Perhaps an approach could be taken similarly to HTMLMediaElement's
</I>&gt;<i> canPlayType().  supportsContext() could return a string, which is one of:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;probably&quot; - the context appears to be supported (but this is not a
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;maybe&quot; - it is impossible to tell whether the context is supported without
</I>&gt;<i> creating it.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot; (empty string) - the context is definitely not supported.
</I>&gt;<i> This avoids returning a simple true/false which implies some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee in the true case.
</I>
I don't really understand the difference between &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;probably&quot; in 
this case.


&gt;<i> &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;software-rendered&quot; or &quot;emulated&quot; or some other term that 
</I>&gt;<i> needs careful definition: context can definitely be created but uses 
</I>&gt;<i> software rendering, e.g. meaning Chrome's SwiftShader will be used for 
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL, or possibly that the user's system does not support 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware-accelerated canvas &quot;2d&quot;.  Since this can apply simultaneously 
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;yes&quot;, perhaps it could also return &quot;yes emulated&quot; or similar.
</I>
That's an interesting idea. Not sure if it's better or worse than the 
proprietary flags mentioned earlier... it's probably not as fine-grained 
in practice.

That does seem like a somewhat better implementation strategy, if viable, 
but doesn't preclude the supportsContext() feature.
