Sure, that's why for example the srcset=&quot;&quot; syntax is extensible and 
already supports arbitrary densities, not just 1x and 2x.

</I>
Only if we think that 3x is more likely to occur than not. It would be 
easy to support everything we could think of, even the unlikely things, 
but the cost would be that instead of a strong solution we'd have an 
unusable one.

In the world of perpetual progress, every solution is &quot;stopgap&quot;. That 
doesn't mean they're not strong solutions in the meantime.

Standardisation is the process of taking innovative ideas and describing 
them in an interoperably implementable way. Standardisation is by 
definition a perpetual game of catch-up.
