The answer, based on replies quoted below from browser vendors, appears to 
be &quot;no&quot;, sadly. I agree that it would be a really useful thing to have.

It is sad that we can't provide an API such as the requested one.

This brings up another point, which is, is the &quot;type&quot; attribute on 
&lt;source&gt; actually useful? Should we remove that and just have browsers 
probe the video subsystem for each resource? We can always add the 
attribute back later if it becomes useful again, but I'd rather not have 
something that isn't used by browsers, since then it'll be used wrong by 
authors, making it useless forever.

Also, should we make .load() asynchronous as far as selecting a media file 
goes? Right now, a media file has to be instantaneously and synchronously 
selected, so the UA can't try each one in turn.

</I>
This is a bad sign; what should we do to fix this?

As soon as implementors want to expose this, I would be more than happy to 
specify how it should work. We shouldn't specify it too soon, though, 
because otherwise UAs are wont to implement the API and just guess or lie, 
making the API useless -- and when there's a more reliable option, we'll 
have to invent a new API anyway.

</I>&gt;<i> A browser that supports &lt;video&gt; but not Ogg will not use the fallback

</I>
If you can get the user to download a binary platform-specific NPAPI 
plugin for Ogg support, why not get the user to download a binary 
platform-specific video backend plugin for Ogg support?

It throws an exception in that case too, and the networkState stays EMPTY. 
So this case can be detected. Would you prefer an error condition?


&gt;<i> More complications arise when we consider cases where only a subset of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that there should be some type of fallback mechanism in place,

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;source&gt; fills in some of the gaps by providing fallback support to a

</I>&gt;<i> also provides a safety net by allowing currently existing fallback 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions to function as expected. Intuitively, I would expect &lt;video&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> with an unsupported codec to behave as if the &lt;video&gt; element itself 
</I>&gt;<i> were unsupported, with perhaps a small note on how to acquire the 
</I>&gt;<i> codec(s) required to play the media, if the UA can determine that much 
</I>&gt;<i> and is configured to display such messages.
</I>
The idea of &lt;video&gt; is to provide a video rendering surface, even when no 
video is selected, so that there's no drastic flipping back and forth as 
the video is loading or as videos are changed, etc.
