</I>
I have added window.navigator.canPlayType(mimeType). It returns 1, 0, or 
-1 to represent positive, neutral, and negative responses.

</I>
Right now the spec picks a resource *without checking with the server*, 
statically, and then the method returns, and then asynchronously it checks 
to see if the resource is usable.

I am proposing changing the spec to make the load() not select a resource. 
Instead, load() would immediately return, and the user agent would then 
asynchronously try each resource that it might otherwise use in turn, 
firing a single loadstart event at the start, lots of progress events, and 
then a loadedmetadata or error event depending on how things go.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This brings up another point, which is, is the &quot;type&quot; attribute on

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is.  Without it, the UA would have to open each source and 
</I>&gt;<i> get its type via HTTP content-type, which is a lot slower, wouldn't it?  
</I>&gt;<i> Is it clear that if the type is supplied in the markup, the UA can (and 
</I>&gt;<i> probably will) use it for content selection, at least at the coarse 
</I>&gt;<i> level, thus avoiding opening connections for files it knows (from the 
</I>&gt;<i> type) it cannot support.
</I>
If we make the load() asynchronous and allow probing from the client 
(testing each potentially supported resource in turn), should we make the 
type optional, then?
