&lt;textarea&gt; is allowed in &lt;label&gt; in HTML5. (And HTML4, too, actually.)

I disagree, it seems quite reasonable to me. It's common in OS UIs, why 
not on the Web?

I don't really follow. The blog post has good advice, but doesn't seem to 
point to a problem in the spec.

Windows clearly does have the equivalent of a label control, even if it 
doesn't expose it as such. The behavior in HTML5, whether you call it a 
change or a clarification, is the right thing for us to require.

The text in HTML5 now says &quot;The label element's exact default presentation 
and behavior, in particular what its activation behavior might be, if 
anything, should match the platform's label behavior.&quot; which seems fine to 
me.

Have you tried just display:block on the textarea instead?
