It's a warning to authors and a permission to developers;  a helpful 
note, that's all.

I don't think I agree.  I can't think why you would do such a rewind 
(media files are not usually that much like physical tape), and if 
you want to do it and be muted, you should mute.  The spec. can be 
perfectly clear that at non-unitary playback rates, including 
negative ones, media may be presented degraded or, particularly for 
audio, not at all.  If muting is needed, then it should be explicitly 
requested.

Working around this prohibition for the case of an implementation 
that could do it and a site that *wants* audio scrubbing, would be a 
pain in the neck.
