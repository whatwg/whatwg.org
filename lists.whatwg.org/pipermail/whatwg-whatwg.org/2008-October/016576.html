While the underlying media frameworks can't necessarily answer, &quot;if I  
give you a file with this MIME type, can you play it?&quot;, they can at  
least give a yes/no/maybe answer, which can still be quite helpful,  
since the UA will know it does not need to check some media streams at  
all.

&gt;<i> Also, should we make .load() asynchronous as far as selecting a  
</I>&gt;<i> media file
</I>&gt;<i> goes? Right now, a media file has to be instantaneously and  
</I>&gt;<i> synchronously
</I>&gt;<i> selected, so the UA can't try each one in turn.
</I>
I believe the original design intent was to make selection completely  
static and not not based on a fallback-like approach of trying each in  
turn. Let's assume IE implements &lt;video&gt; at some point but does not  
support Ogg or MPEG-4 out of the box. Then an author wishing to  
provide 3 media streams could still likely get the job done, since  
browsers could likely determine whether or not particular basic  
content types are supported. It might be hard to get more complex  
cases right though.

Maciej
