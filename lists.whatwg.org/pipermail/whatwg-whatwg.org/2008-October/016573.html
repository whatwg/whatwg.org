</I>
The spec now requires audio playback not to occur when going backwards, 
and allows the user agent to mute audio playback for rates less than or 
greater than 1.0 if desired.

Irrespective of whether the file is streaming is not, you'll always have 
problems like this to do with. (Streaming makes them much more obvious 
though.)


&gt;<i> Streaming mostly forces a playback speed of &quot;+1x&quot; in all cases.

I don't think that's accurate.

I think you should definitely be able to slow down or speed up locally, 
and I think it would make perfect sense for a UA to buffer the last N 
minutes of data, to allow pausing and seeking in the recent stream. This 
is what TiVo does, for instance, with live TV.

I agree that we need to do something to stop seeking backwards past the 
start of the buffer, though. I've redefined &quot;effective start&quot; and company 
to make the UA seek when the buffer's earliest possible point moves.

It's now not allowed, though I suppose an author could always have two 
&lt;video&gt; elements and could make the hidden one seek back and play samples 
forwards as the other is playing the video backwards.


&gt;<i> I think that the spec. should say that degraded playback (e.g. I frames 
</I>&gt;<i> only) or no playback (non-reversed audio) may occur...
</I>
I think that's a quality of implementation issue, I don't really see what 
the spec can say about it.

We don't want some to do it and some not to do it, because then we get all 
kinds of interoperability problems (e.g. someone who hides his video and 
rewinds it at a particular rate for some reason or other, and doesn't hear 
audio in one UA, deploys, and finds his users get audio on another UA).

I agree that on the long term we would want to provide this, but I think 
that is something we should offer as a separate feature (e.g. a flag that 
decides whether reverse-playback audio is muted or not, defaulting to true 
for compatibility with today).
