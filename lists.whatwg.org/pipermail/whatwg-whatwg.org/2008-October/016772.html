I don't understand how inline text is inaccessible. Could you elaborate? 
An example would be useful.


&gt;<i> &gt; Great! Thanks. I think your idea of making rel=&quot;help&quot; be relative to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearest parent &lt;label&gt; is a good one. We could also say it is relative to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the nearest parent &lt;label&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other such grouping element. I'll look at this in more detail when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defining the rel=&quot;&quot; values.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cool. The idea is that the thing is really reliably discoverable - 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise authors will come up with something that makes sense but 
</I>&gt;<i> breaks the implicit model that the spec is built on. I am actually not 
</I>&gt;<i> sure that we mean the same thing when we say &quot;nearest&quot; but I will talk 
</I>&gt;<i> to you off the list about that to clarify that in my mind :-)

Ok.

rel=help is now defined to apply to the link element's parent and its 
children.
