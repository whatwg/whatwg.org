I haven't added this, because I'm not convinced the use cases are as 
compelling as those for maxlength. Maybe we should add this in a future 
version, though, if the feature is found to be needed often enough. (For 
now I'd rather keep things to a minimum to give browser vendors a chance 
to catch up.)


&gt;<i> The autocomplete attribute acts as a boolean, but its values are not

</I>&gt;<i> not use autocomplete=&quot;autocomplete&quot; or its minimised form? Is it because

</I>&gt;<i> noautocomplete. If it's a backward compatibilty issue then I suggest 
</I>&gt;<i> both on/off and true/false should be allowed.
</I>
I'd love to change that, but we're constrained by legacy implementations.

I don't think we want to make things even more complex, especially since 
these new values add nothing and don't work in older browsers.

Yup.

</I>&gt;<i> long. Same for Dutch zip codes that are sometimes written with a space 
</I>&gt;<i> in them and sometimes not, but they're at least 6 characters long.
</I>
US ZIP codes are of the form &quot;12345-6789&quot; or &quot;12345&quot; but minlength 
wouldn't help you as much as pattern=&quot;&quot; here, since &quot;123456&quot; would be past 
the minimum length but totally bogus.


&gt;<i> Perhaps you want users to come up with a password that's at least 6 
</I>&gt;<i> characters long
</I>
Passwords are the only real use case I've seen so far, and while that is 
important, it's not really enough to justify the cost given that there are 
plenty of alternatives for doing this.

It's a different control. That's a major difference. :-)

</I>
Not at all, the user agent can just detect that a pattern is taking a long 
time to match, just like a browser could detect that a document is 
creating too many &lt;img&gt; elements or whatever.

Could you clarify this? I didn't think we'd decided to truncate, just not 
raise an error on initial values that are too long.

I have no idea what you're talking about here, sorry.
