<PRE>This are just my thoughts, however I feel they are worth sharing:

On Thu, Oct 23, 2008 at 4:40 PM, Ian Hickson &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ian at hixie.ch</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> You can call setCustomValidity() to set a specific string.
</I>Joao explicitly asked for a way to achieve this **without scripting
enabled**. I think it's quite obvious why setCustomValidity() doesn't
solve that need.
Would having some sort of &quot;custom-error-message&quot; attribute hurt that
much? (Of course, the name is just an example, and I wouldn't really
suggest it). It would simply ignored by current UAs, and not really
hard to implement (actually, it'd be trivial compared to implementing
reg.exp. parsing).

&gt;&gt;<i> If the UA has scripting disabled, trying to prevent the default action
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for an invalid event won't work. Too overcome this problem, there could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a new attribute which could be called 'notifyoninvalid=&quot;true|false&quot;'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a default value of true, for each control, or for the entire form.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the value is false, then the UA wouldn't notify the user in case of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invalidity. This could then be delegated to some CSS using :invalid;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If scripting is disabled, why would you not want the user notified? That
</I>&gt;<i> would be pretty bad UI. :-)
</I>That'd be really useful if validation can be delegated to server-side
scripting when no client-side scripting is available. Anyway, I don't
think such an attribute is needed: a page can be authored with a
&quot;catch-all&quot; validation rule for the field, and then the Javascript
could update that rule upon the page's loading: if scripts are
dissabled, the rule wouldn't be updated and would stay as the
catch-all.
OTOH, I think Joao's idea was more like to relying on visual hints
(ie: marking the field as red) on cases where an error message popup
would be redundant and annoying. I think that could be more elegantly
handled with an empty attribute value for an hipothetical
&quot;custom-error-message&quot; attribute (which is not the same as an absent
attribute).
