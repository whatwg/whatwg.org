</I>
O.K., but in the case of the + that's in the mailto URI in the action  
attribute, the author means a '+' and not a space (they're allowed to be  
left in raw form in a mailto URI). If it gets sent to a server, the + will  
be treated as a space, which is not what is intended.

The workaround is of course for the author to make sure to encode that +  
as %2B (or never use anything but action=&quot;mailto:&quot; even for POST). But,  
for good measure, it seems like the UA should fix that if the + will ever  
end up in an HTTP URI.

Of course right now, browsers only pass the data as a mailto URI to an  
email program, so the + from the query string will be a + and come out  
fine in the compose window. As for spaces in form control values coming  
out as + (for POST) in a programs's body field, that's not as big of a  
deal as there's no use-case to *see* any of the data *like that* anyway.  
But it does seem incorrect to encode mailto spaces as + though.

However, if for POST, if everything after 'mailto:' in the action  
attribute was dropped (like get) and all you ever had was  
mailto:?body=encoded_stuff that was POSTed, then the spec could say that  
the value you might see in the body field represents *HTTP* url encoded  
data.

Or, the spec could say that if the protocol in the action attribute is  
mailto:, +s in the action attribute have to be encoded as %2B and spaces  
in the action attribute have to be encoded as %20. Then, the validator can  
catch that and the spec can say (for POST), that the body hvalue that gets  
generated from the form represents *HTTP* form data. Then, it'll be clear  
why +s in the value are represented as + instead of %20.

Or, if it's O.K. for a UA's URI normalizer/resolver to take  
action=&quot;mailto:?subject=1+2 3&quot; and normalize that to  
&quot;action=&quot;mailto:?subject=1%2B2%203&quot; for use with the form's .action  
getter, I guess that might solve it to.

Of course, there's no use for POST and action=&quot;mailto:&quot; right now, so I  
guess we have time to fix things later if they become a problem.

Thanks

On a side, if you look at the 'if (form.method == &quot;post&quot;)' condition in  
&lt;<A HREF="http://shadow2531.com/opera/userjs/BeforeMailtoURL.js">http://shadow2531.com/opera/userjs/BeforeMailtoURL.js</A>&gt;, you'll see how I  
handle this. (The form dataset generation is not as complete as it should  
be though, but doing that seems complicated. Wish browsers had a  
form.generateDataset() function)
