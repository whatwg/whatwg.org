I did a tiny prototype of the above use case - audio editor in a browser
- and it would have been significantly easier to write, if not Apple's
Safari had a bad and still unfixed bug in the implementation of 'end'
... (<A HREF="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19305">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19305</A>)

</I>&gt;<i>   The 'start' and 'end' attributes, as currently defined in the spec,

</I>
I know that, but for me that's not the issue at all.

The issue is _latency_. How long from a user action to audible playback
- that's what's relevant to any end user.

You can't do responsive audio manipulation in the browser without fast,
low-latency client-side computation. All the server-side proposals miss
this crucial point.

For another use case, consider web-based tools for DJs, for mixing and
combining audio clips. There's a lot of clips on the web. But if
manipulating them is not realtime enough, people won't care.

For another use case, consider web-based games with dynamic audio, etc.

</I>
And I proposed the beginnings of such an API in several postings on this
list under the topic 'audio canvas', but it seemingly met with little
interest. Now Flash 10 has some of the things I proposed... maybe that's
a louder voice?

&gt;<i> OK, in principle you could use &lt;audio&gt; with data:audio/wav, but that
</I>&gt;<i> would be crazy. Then again, this is the Web so of course people will do
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
I did exactly that in my tiny audio-editor prototype for
proof-of-concept purposes - I guess I must be crazy :-) Actually it was
partly a workaround for browser bugginess, see above.

Give me an API with at least

float getSample(long samplePosition)

putSample(long samplePosition, float sampleValue)

play(long samplePositionStart, unsigned long numSamples),

and sanity will be restored ;-)

The current speed race w.r.t. the fastest JavaScript on the planet will
then take care of the rest.

</I>
Unless Media Fragments can be a) set dynamically for an already
downloaded media file _without triggering re-download_,  b) time
specification can be accurate to the individual sample for the case of
audio, c) W3C finishes this quickly enough and d) browsers take the W3C
recommendation seriously, it is not an alternative for my use cases.

It's all about dynamic audio and the future. By the time the spec hits
the market, static media is not the only thing on the web anymore.

If I understand this correctly, cue callback delay would potentially
make it impossible to have precise audio intervals, needed for the above
use cases.

But _then_ replacing 'start' and 'end' with cue ranges and 'currentTime'
is NOT possible, because they are no longer guaranteed to be equivalent
in terms of precision.

It seems the arguments are converging more towards keeping 'start' and
'end' in the spec.
