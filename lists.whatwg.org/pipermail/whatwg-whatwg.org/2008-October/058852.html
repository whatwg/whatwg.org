I agree. If the API lets us answer &quot;maybe&quot;, there is not much need or
temptation to lie, and we can still return information that could be useful
to scripts.

IMHO load() should be asynchronous and should try each in turn. That would
dramatically increase the power of fallback and doesn't seem to cost too
much. Chris Double points out that there are edge cases where some streams
in a container are supported, but others aren't; for example a framework
might support only Ogg Vorbis but not Theora, and you try to play a
Vorbis+Theora file, and you get no error from the framework, but you might
have preferred to fall back. However, if the author provided the right MIME
information, the UA could know that there is supposed to be video, and
detect that there isn't any video coming out, and fall back.
