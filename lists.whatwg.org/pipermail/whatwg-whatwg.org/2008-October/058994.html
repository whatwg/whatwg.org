It's not about one or the other. It's about having functionality that
allows download of just a segment of audio/video from an origin server
to the UA, *and* about the ability to manipulate audio/video locally
on the client. The latter one is not so difficult - you can do a lot
of things in javascript. The first one is the one that requires setup
of standard URIs and mechanisms to support Web proxies with such media
fragments etc.

</I>
Your biggest problem with this use case are compressed files and the
multitude of codec formats that will need to be supported. If think if
you are really keen for such an application on the web, you would
fully download your audio clips and fully decode them to wav and then
apply your manipulations. The manipulations can then be done in
realtime client-side - no further interaction with the Web and no
further interactions with codecs are necessary.

May be a bit early for that. Let's get audio and video into the Web first.

a) is about choice. If you fully download a video, then you can most
certainly do all sorts of local dynamic manipulation of it. The use
case of remote media fragments is e.g. for search, where you are
looking for a particular segment out of a long file (e.g. 8 hours of
parliamentary sitting recorded) and don't want to wait until the full
file has downloaded to just play the bit you are interested in. Your
use cases don't fit that need - initial download time is irrelevant to
you, but interactivity is of importance.

b) time specifications will never give you sample accuracy for a
compressed codec. A compressed codec can only really address based on
encoding blocks. For your needs, you will probably always have to
decode your audio to a raw format to do the rich manipulations you are
after.

c) a temporal media fragment addressing scheme is due within a year
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2008/01/media-fragments-wg.html">http://www.w3.org/2008/01/media-fragments-wg.html</A> .

d) it's not only the browser vendors that have to do work - it's the
media formats that will need to write client-side support for media
fragment delivery that have the most work to do.


Cheers,
Silvia.
