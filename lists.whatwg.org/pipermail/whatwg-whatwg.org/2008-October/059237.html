</I>&gt;<i> Although I agree with the overall idea, I have to mention that the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;type&quot; attribute itself wouldn't be a good match for this purpose: it
</I>&gt;<i> is already used for something different (marking the content type for
</I>&gt;<i> stuff like &lt;script&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, the new &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;, and
</I>&gt;<i> so on, often expressed as a Mime type). In general, I think
</I>&gt;<i> overloading an attribute with different meanings (semantics) is not a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea (we should leave the &lt;input&gt; case aside of this
</I>&gt;<i> generalization, mostly because it's been using the attribute for over
</I>&gt;<i> a decade by now). IMHO, a &quot;role&quot; attribute would match exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> you are asking for, although I sent some feedback about it a while ago
</I>&gt;<i> and got no responses (it probably went unnoticed, since there were
</I>&gt;<i> several discussions running on by the time, and a few of them were
</I>&gt;<i> quite heated). Maybe now that you are raising this issue I should try
</I>&gt;<i> to bring back the relevant parts of those mails?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, if a &quot;type&quot;, &quot;role&quot;, or similar attribute was added, we should
</I>&gt;<i> question the need of the &lt;mark&gt; element (and many others) at all: what
</I>&gt;<i> would it provide that a &lt;span&gt; with the same &quot;type&quot; or &quot;role&quot; doesn't?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I've seen some comments suggesting that class should be used for
</I>&gt;<i> these purposes, and not just as a hook for CSS. If the spec is clear
</I>&gt;<i> enough about this broader semantics of the class attribute, and UAs
</I>&gt;<i> are aware of it, the only practical difference between class and
</I>&gt;<i> type/role will be whether the author can come up with any arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> value (class), or has to choose between a pre-defined set (type/role).
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure which approach would be better for this specific case.
</I>&gt;<i> Have **you** considered using &quot;class&quot; for the purpose you are
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting? If you have, and you still feel it's not enough, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> explaining *why* would be helpful to figure out what the best solution
</I>&gt;<i> would be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my thoughts.
</I>
Well, first of all, my personal &quot;ideal&quot; situation would be to provide a 
&lt;footnote&gt; element, that UAs would have to render with a footnote 
superscripted automatically numbered reference-link. a href-attribute would 
indicate where to link to.
But I guess that is out of the question ;-)

I would never opt for using &quot;class&quot; for anything other than CSS styling. The 
reason for this being that I feel that neither &quot;id&quot; nor &quot;class&quot; should 
contain keywords, but only author defined words. For me a &quot;type&quot; or &quot;role&quot; 
attribute would be like an &quot;id&quot; or &quot;class&quot; only it would contain keywords 
and be not style-related but content related.
