Basically the answer is because it can already be done with &quot;name&quot;.

We've expanded name=&quot;&quot; in HTML5 to allow basically any value.

That's not the case (indeed we had an XML format for a while), but I don't 
think it's necessary in this case anyway.

It's not old-fashioned, these techniques are all valid techniques. Let's 
avoid putting down each other's conventions.


&gt;<i> 2. The identifier should be unique throughout the document so your code

He was making up his own markup proposal, so there's no way to know if 
this is true or not. It appears you are making assumptions about his 
proposal here that are not warranted.


&gt;<i> If I understand your intention correctly, you want to submit an entire 
</I>&gt;<i> table instead of just one record a time; HTML forms clearly were not 
</I>&gt;<i> designed with that application in mind.  I think you would be better off

</I>&gt;<i> shows that it is often the case with current implementations.
</I>
That seems overly complicated; I would recommend using a key exactly as 
the original poster attempted, but simply using the name field and 
separating the key from the field name with a punctuation character.

Different people have different needs. I wouldn't characterise the use of 
a convention for naming input controls as a hack. Also, this shouldn't 
require JavaScript, it can be purely server-side logic.
