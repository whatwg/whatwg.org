<PRE>Hi Shannon,

Bummer :-( Please don't give up!

Sorry if this is a really stupid question (my knowledge of proxy-servers is
minimal) but what issues are involved here that have not been solved with a
product such as Orbited? <A HREF="http://www.orbited.org/">http://www.orbited.org/</A>

Look, I've never used it but, if I understand it correctly, it sits behind
the proxy-server and traps the Socket traffic and forwards it onto the
designated run-o'-the-mill TCP/IP server. Could a similar mechanism(s) not
work here? Is it that we're dealing with runtime discovery of public
proxy-servers outside any firewalls? Something else?

Cheers Richard Maher

PS. Much prefer the websocket.read(bytes) and websocket.write(bytes) well
done! Please don't forget websocket.peek(bytes).

Subject: [whatwg] WebSocket and proxies


&gt;<i> In the process of testing my WebSocket proposal I discovered the CONNECT
</I>&gt;<i> method has a major restriction. Most proxies disable CONNECT to anything
</I>&gt;<i> but port 443.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The following is from &quot;Squid and the Blowfish&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------
</I>&gt;<i> It is very important that you stop CONNECT type requests to non-SSL
</I>&gt;<i> ports. The CONNECT method allows data transfer in any direction at any
</I>&gt;<i> time, regardless of the transport protocol used. As a consequence, a
</I>&gt;<i> malicious user could telnet(1) to a (very) badly configured proxy, enter
</I>&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;<i> ... snip example ...
</I>&gt;<i> and end up connected to the remote server, as if the connection was
</I>&gt;<i> originated by the proxy.
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I verified that Squid and all public proxies I tried disable CONNECT by
</I>&gt;<i> default to non-SSL ports. It's unlikely many internet hosts will have
</I>&gt;<i> 443 available for WebSockets if they also run a webserver. It could be
</I>&gt;<i> done with virtual IPs or dedicated hosts but this imposes complex
</I>&gt;<i> requirements and costs over alternatives like CGI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The availability and capabilities of the OPTIONS and GET protocols also
</I>&gt;<i> varied from proxy to proxy. The IETF draft related to TLS
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-http-upgrade-05">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-http-upgrade-05</A>) has this to
</I>say:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 3.2 Mandatory Upgrade
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If an unsecured response would be unacceptable, a client MUST send
</I>&gt;<i>    an OPTIONS request first to complete the switch to TLS/1.0 (if
</I>&gt;<i>    possible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
</I>&gt;<i>           Host: example.bank.com
</I>&gt;<i>           Upgrade: TLS/1.0
</I>&gt;<i>           Connection: Upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So according to this draft spec OPTIONS is the only way to do a
</I>&gt;<i> *mandatory* upgrade of our connection. Once again this failed in testing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Connection: Upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Upgrade: WebSocket/1.0
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Host: warriorhut.org:8000
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;= HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;= Server: squid/3.0.STABLE8
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other proxies gave different errors or simply returned nothing. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem may be related to the Upgrade and Connection headers rather than
</I>&gt;<i> OPTIONS, since I had similar issues using Connection: Upgrade with GET.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had the most success using GET without a Connection: Upgrade header.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the proxy thinks the header is directed at it so it does
</I>&gt;<i> not pass it on to the remote host. In many cases it will abort the
</I>&gt;<i> connection. Using the Upgrade: header without Connection allows the
</I>&gt;<i> Upgrade header through to the actual websocket service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that whatever we try in many cases the connection will be
</I>&gt;<i> silently dropped by the proxy and the reasons will be unclear due to the
</I>&gt;<i> lack of error handling. There seems to be a wide variation in proxy
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour for uncommon operations. I suppose proxy developers could fix
</I>&gt;<i> these issues but whether a significant rollout could be achieved before
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 is released is questionable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that an asynchronous connection cannot be cached the only reasons
</I>&gt;<i> remaining for going through a proxy are anonymity and firewall
</I>&gt;<i> traversal. Automatically bypassing the users proxy configuration to
</I>&gt;<i> solve the issues above has the potential to break both of these. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be a significant breach of trust for a UA to bypass the users
</I>&gt;<i> proxy and some networks only allow connections via a proxy (for security
</I>&gt;<i> and monitoring).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that we're stuck between a rock and hard place here. In light
</I>&gt;<i> of this I reiterate my earlier suggestion that the time could be better
</I>&gt;<i> spent providing guidelines for communication via an asynchronous CGI
</I>&gt;<i> interface. This would allow reuse of existing port 80 and 443 web
</I>&gt;<i> services which would resolve the cross-domain issues (the CGI can relay
</I>&gt;<i> the actual service via a backend connection) and most of the proxy
</I>&gt;<i> issues above (since proxy GET and CONNECT are more reliable on these
</I>ports).
