<PRE>Hi Maciej,

Does OS X (or the iPhone for that matter) support Java 6 yet?

And were all these security bug reports you keep seeing to do with Java in
general, or the Apple version in particular?

Would &quot;Strict Same Origin&quot; policy not be useful as an optional (perhaps
default) configuration?

Cheers Richard Maher

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of major security issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's tongue-in-cheek that I don't expect it to be adopted or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seriously considered (this year). It's not tongue-in-cheek in that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very much wish it were adopted. That is, I think it's in the realm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the desirable, not the possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am curious what issues you see with same origin content. They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly exist, but I tend to feel those are orthogonal to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues at hand, and subject for a separate discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do think we have an existence proof that security in this realm is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible. That's Java. Modulo some outright bugs in VMs (since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repaired) the default Java applet security model has worked and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worked well since 1.0 beta 1. (1.0 alpha 1 wasn't quite strict
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough.) I have seen no security design flaws exposed in Java
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applets in over ten years. That's why I suspect duplicating Java's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security policy in HTML is a safe way forward. I'm skeptical that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything less will suffice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Java's security policy is also looser in some ways. For example, it
</I>&gt;<i> allows the applet to connect to any port on the origin server. This
</I>&gt;<i> has at times caused Java applets to be subject to vulnerabilities that
</I>&gt;<i> did not affect plain HTML+JS+CSS (more recently than in the past 10
</I>&gt;<i> years). The general Web same-origin policy considers the port as well
</I>&gt;<i> as the host to be part of the origin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More generally, I am on Apple's internal incoming security bug list,
</I>&gt;<i> and I see Java applet security bugs all the time, so I think whatever
</I>&gt;<i> the strength of the model may be, it does not lead to Java applets
</I>&gt;<i> being secure in practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, the key question for whether strict same-origin can work
</I>&gt;<i> it not one of security but of functionality and usability. The trend
</I>&gt;<i> in recent years has been for browsers to punch more controlled holes
</I>&gt;<i> in the same-origin policy to fulfill the frequent desire of Web
</I>&gt;<i> application developers to communicate with other servers from the
</I>&gt;<i> client side. This is desirable so that &quot;AJAX&quot; apps (where most of the
</I>&gt;<i> logic and functionality is client-side) can make use of third-party
</I>&gt;<i> Web services APIs, in the same way that native apps can, without
</I>&gt;<i> having to round-trip through their own server. I do not see this trend
</I>&gt;<i> reversing any time soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In conclusion I think limiting the Web to 100% strict same-origin
</I>&gt;<i> would not be desirable even in an ideal world where compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> issues are not a concern.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't expect this to happen, however, because many large players
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are exploiting existing security design flaws in the web to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things they shouldn't be allowed to do in the first place,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially tracking users. Any scheme that limits the ability of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advertisers and others to track users will be strenuously resisted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the record, neither Apple nor the WebKit project have any strong
</I>&gt;<i> commercial interest in the ability of advertisers or others to track
</I>&gt;<i> users.
