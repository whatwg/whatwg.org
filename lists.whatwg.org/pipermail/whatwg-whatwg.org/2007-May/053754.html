Thanks for the idea.

I don't think a document outline DOM API is something that has a great 
deal of demand. It's also something that could be implemented in a 
JavaScript library or on the serverside. Generally speaking we want to 
keep the APIs in the spec to a minimum, limiting them to primitives that 
are useful for a broad range of purposes, rather than having many 
special-purpose APIs. So I haven't added the outline DOM idea to the spec.

The main reason for having this section is to enable scripts and user 
agents to create outlines in user interfaces without ambiguity about what 
is a section. This is an area that has historically been very much 
underdefined. We shall have to see, with implementation experience, 
whether this is useful or not, and what UA implementors will do with it.

Cheers,
