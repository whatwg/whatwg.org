</I>&gt;<i> The style and script elements in XHTML have a potentially anything goes

</I>&gt;<i> pass style and script types it knows about (with the proper content 
</I>&gt;<i> model for each type)?
</I>
I would expect a conformance checker to have a &quot;could not validate&quot; mode 
which was between &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, though presented more like &quot;no&quot;, for the 
state where there was no actual error, but something that normally can be 
checked couldn't be verified for whatever reason.


&gt;<i> 2.14.1.1.
</I>&gt;<i> The spec should probably mention
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoehrmann-script-types-03.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoehrmann-script-types-03.txt</A> or its
</I>&gt;<i> successor around here.
</I>
I have no idea which section that was, nor which RFC that is (the URI is 
now dead). Is there an updated link?


&gt;<i> 2.17. &amp; 2.18.
</I>&gt;<i> Are calendars and cards expected to be unstylable replaced elements in
</I>&gt;<i> rendering?
</I>
Those sections are gone now.


&gt;<i> 2.20.1.
</I>&gt;<i> When I read this, I had trouble organizing (in my mind) what I was reading
</I>&gt;<i> because I had no prior understanding of where the spec was going. Up to this
</I>&gt;<i> point, I had had prior hypotheses that were confirmed or disconfirmed by the
</I>&gt;<i> spec. This section would be a lot easier to read if it had an introductionary
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph stating the relationship of rendering, the DOM, the data model
</I>&gt;<i> object and data submission. (Is the DOM being rendered or is a replaced widget
</I>&gt;<i> element being rendered? Is it stylable? Is the data model reflected back to
</I>&gt;<i> the DOM? What's the expected way of serializing the data model and sending it
</I>&gt;<i> back to the server?)
</I>
I don't know which section this is talking about. Is it better now? Since 
last year I've made several attempts at making the spec flow better.


&gt;<i> 2.20.1.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I wondered whether this functionality is best specced as part of the UA
</I>&gt;<i> or whether it would be better to ship it as a MIT/expat-licensed pure-JS
</I>&gt;<i> library for running on top of the lower-level JS/DOM APIs. (Note: Considering
</I>&gt;<i> what I wrote above, I don't really understand what the aims are, so I may be
</I>&gt;<i> totally missing the point.)
</I>
Not sure what you mean.


&gt;<i> 2.20.1.3.
</I>&gt;<i> I had trouble trying to extract markup-level conformance requirements for
</I>&gt;<i> stuff that can occur inside the datagrid.
</I>
It's just any block-level content. Why was it unclear? Do you think it 
should be further restricted? I've made it explicit.


&gt;<i> 2.20.1.3.
</I>&gt;<i> Is select allowed to occur in the block context only here or anywhere?
</I>
Oops. Allowed &lt;select&gt; now. (&lt;datalist&gt; too.)


&gt;<i> 2.20.2.
</I>&gt;<i> Is command in head conforming in the XHTML serialization only? (It is a
</I>&gt;<i> phasing element in the tree construction section.)
</I>
At some point I'll put &lt;command&gt; in the &lt;head&gt; in the parser, I think. 
Otherwise, it'll be allowed in the &lt;head&gt; in XHTML only (or not at all).


&gt;<i> 2.20.3.
</I>&gt;<i> It why not use type=&quot;context&quot; for declaring a context menu?
</I>
Yeah, I guess that's fine. Changed.


&gt;<i> 3.1.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We could make this into a string value that acts as a Hint for why the
</I>&gt;<i> command is disabled.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that to be trouble, because general purpose code for dealing 
</I>&gt;<i> with boolean attributes would need to take that special case into 
</I>&gt;<i> account. Using another attribute for a hint would be fine, though.
</I>
The reason to have the boolean be the string would be to force authors to 
provide the hint. You could easily provide the hint using &quot;title&quot;, the key 
is to find a way to force authors into writing good code.


&gt;<i> 4.4.1.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Since all HTML elements can thus be focused and unfocusd&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> unfocused
</I>
Apparently this went away.


&gt;<i> 4.5.
</I>&gt;<i> Is onerror only a DOM attribute or is it a markup attribute as well? Whose
</I>&gt;<i> attribute is it?
</I>
Is this defined to your satisfaction now?
