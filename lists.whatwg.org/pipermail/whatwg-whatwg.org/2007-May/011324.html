That's sad. I'm not sure what to do about it though.

It would in fact reduce the quality to be essentially worthless on 
high-res displays when people want to do decent quality graphics.


&gt;<i> For people who really do want high quality output and know what they're 
</I>&gt;<i> doing, there could be some way to query the current canvas-&gt;display 
</I>&gt;<i> scaling factor (taking account of high-res displays, zoomed pages, CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> scaling, etc) and they can manually change the canvas's width/height to

</I>&gt;<i> even update the size of the bitmap every frame, so it continues looking 
</I>&gt;<i> good if the user has zoomed in on the page. Or they could use SVG.
</I>
I guess that's one way.

That approach would make existing canvases shrink to a tiny dot when 
printing.

Hm.

Isn't this obvious? I mean, JS doesn't have typing, and so any interface 
that JS can represent is implementable in JS...

I can make them non-readonly if people want.

Isn't it?

That's another option, indeed. We could address this when someone 
implements a high-res &lt;canvas&gt;.

</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.

I've added an example.

The use cases it was intended for were the first and last. I'm not really 
sure I understand the second use case.


&gt;<i> So, I was considering the function
</I>&gt;<i>    getImageData(sx, sy, sw, sh, hires)
</I>
I think that's an interesting idea, but I think what we should do is wait 
for someone to implement a high res canvas, and if stuff breaks, then we 
retroactively redefine getImageData to return low res data, and then add 
the high-res flag.
