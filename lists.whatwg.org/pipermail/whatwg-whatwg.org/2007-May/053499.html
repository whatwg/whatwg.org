<PRE>Philip,

You have a reasonable point. I still think that an implementation would 
be trivial, but you're right that there is more complexity for the 
specification than simply defining one more method API.  On the other 
hand, I think it is legitimate to take the SVG-Tiny route and leave 
specific rendering details to the implementation.  After all, you're not 
specifying line and curve drawing algorithms down to the pixel, are you?

 &gt; There are other missing features that people are actively implementing
 &gt; workarounds for, like drawing text, which is a good indicator of
 &gt; demand. Are there examples where people are currently fighting against
 &gt; the lack of dashed lines?

The problem of layering text on top of a canvas is a solvable one, so 
people are solving it.  I don't think that dashed lines can really be 
worked around. If there is no native support, they're not worth doing. 
To me the killer use-case for dashed lines is this: displaying multiple 
data series in a line chart that will be printed in black-and-white. 
People have been using dashed lines for that since Rene Descartes 
invented the coordinate system!

I come to this from an admittedly theoretical perspective, but the need 
for dashed lines just seems self-evident to me. I assume that the 
omission of dashed lines was simply an oversight in the original Apple 
implementation, and I'm really surprised by the resistance to adding 
this from whatwg.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And, I can't think of any simple or efficient way to simulate dashed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lines without having them in the API.  And while dashed lines may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a high-use feature, I wouldn't say they're infrequently used.  For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; example: when drawing a line chart with multiple lines which is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to be printed on a black-and-white laser printer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; There are many styles that aren't supported -- dashes aren't an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For example, there's no support for having defined markers repeated 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the stroke. Similarly, we don't havenative  support for rounded 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corners,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; or for many shapes (e.g. circles).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dashes would be trivial to add--it is just a single additional line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> style property.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it's entirely trivial to add, to the detail that's
</I>&gt;<i> necessary in a specification. The common graphics APIs (at least
</I>&gt;<i> Cairo, Quartz and java.awt.Graphics, and any SVG implementation) all
</I>&gt;<i> have dashes specified by passing an array of dash lengths (alternating
</I>&gt;<i> on/off), so that should be alright as long as you define what units
</I>&gt;<i> it's measured in and what happens when you specify an odd number of
</I>&gt;<i> values and how errors are handled and what happens if you update the
</I>&gt;<i> array later. But after that, what does it do when stroking multiple
</I>&gt;<i> subpaths, in terms of offsetting the dashes? When you use strokeRect,
</I>&gt;<i> where is offset 0? Does moveTo reset the offset? How does it interact
</I>&gt;<i> with lineCap/lineJoin? All the potential issues need test cases too,
</I>&gt;<i> and the implementations need to make sure they handle any edge cases
</I>&gt;<i> that the underlying graphics library does differently. (SVG Tiny 1.2
</I>&gt;<i> appears to skip some of the problems by leaving things undefined and
</I>&gt;<i> allowing whatever behaviour the graphics library has.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; You can do dashed lines using paths.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is true only in theory. Way too much computation is necessary to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transform a path into a dashed path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's particularly a problem for Bezier curves - decomposing them
</I>&gt;<i> into fixed-length segments in JS wouldn't be any fun. At least it's
</I>&gt;<i> not difficult for straight lines (and someone could write a pure-JS
</I>&gt;<i> canvas extension library to provide that kind of feature), but I have
</I>&gt;<i> no idea how often people want dashed curves compared to dashed lines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Without more demand for this feature,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it's not clear that it's worth us putting it into the language.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is just one more method on CanvasRenderingContext2D.  And the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation would almost certainly be trivial.  You'll see the demand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for dashed lines when Canvas becomes standardized without it, and people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start wondering how to do dashes.  It truly seems strange to me that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this feature has been omitted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's one method plus detailed specification and tests and multiple
</I>&gt;<i> implementations and bugs and documentation - none of those are
</I>&gt;<i> especially difficult, but all the work adds up, so there has to be
</I>&gt;<i> enough justification in order to add a feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are other missing features that people are actively implementing
</I>&gt;<i> workarounds for, like drawing text, which is a good indicator of
</I>&gt;<i> demand. Are there examples where people are currently fighting against
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of dashed lines?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I think a number of the features already in the spec fail the
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness requirements, or aren't specified to the detail necessary
</I>&gt;<i> for interoperability, but that's not a reason to add more.)
