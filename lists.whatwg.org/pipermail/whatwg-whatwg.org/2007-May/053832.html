</I>
When you said &quot;the latter is the option I'm following for now&quot; I thought 
you referred to &quot;and Firefox and IE7/Win don't change any links&quot;. Is 
that not the case?

Looking at the spec it doesn't mention anything special regarding DOM 
mutations at all, so that would indeed make me think that links are 
changed if a &lt;base&gt; element is inserted at the top of the &lt;head&gt; using 
the DOM.

&gt;&gt;<i> What I suggest is that we make the first or last &lt;base&gt; element in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;head&gt; be the one that sets both the base target and the base href for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the document (modulo all special handling needed when &lt;base&gt;s appear in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the body, described below). While this is not what IE or Firefox does 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> today, I doubt that it'll break enough pages to stray from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> act-like-the-DOM-looks principal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now the href=&quot;&quot; is from the first and the target=&quot;&quot; is from the 
</I>&gt;<i> last, but other than that that's what the spec says.
</I>
Why is the fact that the last target is the one used only defined in a 
Note? Or am I missing it somewhere else?

Also, if we're going to be inconsistent in how current browsers and web 
pages handle multiple &lt;base&gt;s, why not simply use the first &lt;base&gt; for 
both href=&quot;&quot; and target=&quot;&quot;?

&gt;&gt;<i> One thing we unfortunately will have to deal with is &lt;base&gt; elements 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appearing in the middle of the body of the document. What mozilla had to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do was once we find a &lt;base&gt; element in the body of the document, we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tell the parser to remember the resolved href and/or target of that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;base&gt; element. We then for any element that uses base uris (full list 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at [1]) set an internal member in the element that hardcodes the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements base uri and/or base target.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For elements that don't get this property set on them base href and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target resolution works as normal. For elements that has this set base 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> href and target resolution only uses the set properties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that you only set the saved href and target in the parser if the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute is set in the &lt;base&gt; element. So if a document contains &lt;base 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; in the middle of the body that does not set a saved href 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is deep magic, as far as the DOM goes. It also makes it hard to debug 
</I>&gt;<i> -- e.g. dynamically modifiying &lt;base&gt; elements, moving them, etc, has no 
</I>&gt;<i> effect anymore.
</I>
Yup, I agree that this is deep magic as far as a DOM user goes.

&gt;<i> HOWEVER, having said that, this is a tiny minority of pages. According to 
</I>&gt;<i> a study I did of over 100,000,000 pages, 0.036% of pages have more than 
</I>&gt;<i> one &lt;base href=&quot;&quot;&gt; element (ignoring those that specify the same href=&quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> value more than once).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With &lt;base href=&quot;&quot;&gt;, you can get 404s, but in practice IE7 is already 
</I>&gt;<i> doing that, and it doesn't seem to have affected adoption. Anecdotely, 
</I>&gt;<i> most of these pages use absolute URIs, which might explain it.
</I>
It's much easier for IE to get away with breaking pages, mostly because 
many people use IE as the yard-stick.

&gt;<i> 0.06% of pages have more than one &lt;base target=&quot;&quot;&gt; element (again ignoring 
</I>&gt;<i> duplicates). With &lt;base target=&quot;&quot;&gt;, the worst that can happen from the 
</I>&gt;<i> user's point of view is that links will open in a new page instead of on 
</I>&gt;<i> the same page, and in practice even that's not likely, since (anecdotely) 
</I>&gt;<i> most pages with &lt;base target=&quot;&quot;&gt; simply alternate between different names.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
I would be hesitant to drop support for multiple &lt;base&gt;s in firefox 
actually. Implementation wise it was very easy to implement, and it is 
known that many pages out there break, though the percentage is small, 
there are a lot of pages on the internet.

It might be something we could restrict to quirks mode pages though, 
that's not a bad idea at all.
