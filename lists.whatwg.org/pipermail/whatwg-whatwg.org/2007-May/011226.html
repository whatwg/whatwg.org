<PRE>Philip,

You have a reasonable point. I still think that an implementation would 
be trivial, but you're right that there is more complexity for the 
specification than simply defining one more method API.  On the other 
hand, I think it is legitimate to take the SVG-Tiny route and leave 
specific rendering details to the implementation.  After all, you're not 
specifying line and curve drawing algorithms down to the pixel, are you?

 &gt; There are other missing features that people are actively implementing
 &gt; workarounds for, like drawing text, which is a good indicator of
 &gt; demand. Are there examples where people are currently fighting against
 &gt; the lack of dashed lines?

The problem of layering text on top of a canvas is a solvable one, so 
people are solving it.  I don't think that dashed lines can really be 
worked around. If there is no native support, they're not worth doing. 
To me the killer use-case for dashed lines is this: displaying multiple 
data series in a line chart that will be printed in black-and-white. 
People have been using dashed lines for that since Rene Descartes 
invented the coordinate system!

I come to this from an admittedly theoretical perspective, but the need 
for dashed lines just seems self-evident to me. I assume that the 
omission of dashed lines was simply an oversight in the original Apple 
implementation, and I'm really surprised by the resistance to adding 
this from whatwg.
