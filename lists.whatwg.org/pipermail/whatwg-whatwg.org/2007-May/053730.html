The HTML WG accepted to review the HTML 5 proposal. Presumably members of  
the HTML WG are doing that. I'm not sure why they would need tutorials as  
well to do such a thing.

</I>&gt;<i> one can accept. But then again, the HTMLwg has been conveened pretty  
</I>&gt;<i> much because of WHATwg - so it would be a bit strange.
</I>
I think the fundamentals of the specification are not really up for  
debate. It has to be compatible with the web.
