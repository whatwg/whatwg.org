There are many styles that aren't supported -- dashes aren't an exception. 
For example, there's no support for having defined markers repeated around 
the stroke. Similarly, we don't havenative  support for rounded corners, 
or for many shapes (e.g. circles).

You can do dashed lines using paths. Without more demand for this feature, 
it's not clear that it's worth us putting it into the language.

There apparently isn't much demand for it for Flash either.

</I>
Why? CSS' styles are the result of a pretty arbitrary set of decisions in 
committee meetings. (I know, I've been on the CSSWG for ~7 years.)

Pretty much, I think.
