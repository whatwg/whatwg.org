</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When an author uses a new class name not defined by either this

</I>&gt;<i> It has been pointed out to me that the offers would drive developer

Regarding all of the above, now that this section of the spec has been 
removed, the above comments no longer apply. Thanks for the feedback, 
though.

What's the advantage of allowing this, given that authors can already use 
class=&quot;&quot; on links?
