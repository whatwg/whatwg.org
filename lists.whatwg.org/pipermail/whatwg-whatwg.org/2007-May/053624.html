I think the definitions would have to say to handle -Infinity as well
as Infinity, and say setTransform with finite arguments un-sets the
&quot;marked as finite&quot; flag, and maybe say that &quot;marked as finite&quot; is
saved/restored along with the transformation matrix.

But I'm not really convinced it's worthwhile at all, since it isn't a
trivial definition. I would assume it doesn't make the implementations
more complex (since they already have to cope with &quot;scale(1e200,
1e200); scale(1e200; 1e200)&quot; which is no different to &quot;scale(Infinity,
Infinity)&quot;) but it does make the specification more complex and adds
seemingly arbitrary restrictions (e.g. why it will let me draw a
finite rectangle scaled by infinity, but not an infinite rectangle). I
don't now think these cases would be likely to come up for many
people, and exceptions are at least obvious when debugging so they're
not really that hard to fix, and simplifying the specification for
normal readers seems like a better trade-off...
