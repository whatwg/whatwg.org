</I>
No, it's neither true nor obvious (nor is it obvious that it isn't true).

I tried to make this clearer recently though, let me know if it's still 
confusing.


&gt;<i> Relating to gradients:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Otherwise, if it is ... a CanvasGradient or CanvasPattern, then an 
</I>&gt;<i> object supporting those interfaces must be returned. Such objects are 
</I>&gt;<i> opaque and therefore only useful for assigning to other attributes or 
</I>&gt;<i> for comparison to other gradients or patterns.&quot; - what does &quot;opaque&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> mean? It doesn't seem to be defined here.
</I>
It's a technical term meaning you can't get anything useful out of them.


&gt;<i> Should it be the case that &quot;ctx.fillStyle === ctx.fillStyle&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ctx.fillStyle = grad; ctx.fillStyle === grad&quot;? That seems necessary if 
</I>&gt;<i> useful comparison is to be possible, but it doesn't seem to be what the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;must&quot; statement says. And should it be that 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ctx.createLinearGradient(...) !== ctx.createLinearGradient(...)&quot;?
</I>
Yes to all of those. I've tried to clarify it.


&gt;<i> Should it be that &quot;ctx.fillStyle = grad; grad.addColorStop(...)&quot; will 
</I>&gt;<i> alter the currently-selected fill style, i.e. fillStyle has to store a 
</I>&gt;<i> reference to the gradient instead of a copy? (If so, then &quot;ctx.fillStyle 
</I>&gt;<i> = grad; ctx.fillStyle.addColorStop(...)&quot; should work too, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> nice.)
</I>
Yes. That should be clearer now.


&gt;<i> &quot;Immediately before the 0 offset and immediately after the 1 offset, 
</I>&gt;<i> transparent black stops are be assumed.&quot; and &quot;any points beyond the 
</I>&gt;<i> start or end points are a transparent black.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is not implemented interoperably [3], and it has been suggested [4] 
</I>&gt;<i> that Firefox's behaviour might be better. FF extends the outermost 
</I>&gt;<i> colour stops outwards forever - that is the most powerful approach, 
</I>&gt;<i> since you can manually add transparent-black or black stops to reproduce 
</I>&gt;<i> the behaviours of Opera (equivalent to the current spec) and Safari.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> One issue with FF's behaviour is what to do when a linear gradient has 
</I>&gt;<i> zero length (i.e. x0,y0 == x1,y1) - it could just be defined to be 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to the first colour stop, which seems to be what FF does.
</I>
I've made it paint nothing for now.


&gt;<i> What if multiple stops are added at the same offset? I would say 
</I>&gt;<i> something along the lines of: &quot;If there is already a stop at the same 
</I>&gt;<i> /offset/, the new color stop must be treated as if its /offset/ is 
</I>&gt;<i> greater than that of the earlier stop.&quot; i.e. the first stop added will 
</I>&gt;<i> be closest to offset 0, and the last will be (infinitesimally) closest 
</I>&gt;<i> to offset 1. Firefox and Opera appear to implement it that way; Safari 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to have a consistent order at all. See [5].
</I>
I've effectively done that.


&gt;<i> Some points on pedantic standardese (given that [6] indicates it's 
</I>&gt;<i> desirable to be precise about normative statements) (though I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> uncertain on the correctness of some of these points, so please disagree 
</I>&gt;<i> if I'm wrong):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The width attribute defaults to 300, and the height attribute defaults 
</I>&gt;<i> to 150.&quot; - should have &quot;must&quot;s.
</I>
The musts are in other parts of the spec. The &quot;defaults&quot; in this case is 
just a definition. (Equivalent to &quot;The default is...&quot;.)


&gt;<i> &quot;String comparisons should be literal and case-sensitive.&quot; - 
</I>&gt;<i> s/should/must/
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;The save() method pushes ... The restore() method pops ... If there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no saved state, the method does nothing.&quot; - should have &quot;must&quot;s.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> globalCompositeOperation: &quot;It must be set to a value from the following 
</I>&gt;<i> list ... User agents must only recognise values that exactly match the 
</I>&gt;<i> values given above.&quot; - but that conflicts with the 
</I>&gt;<i> vendorName-operationName extensions, because authors and UAs have to use 
</I>&gt;<i> values not in that list if they're going to use that extension 
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity; and the vendorName-operationName syntax is only a &quot;should&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> so a conforming vendor could define their own operator called e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;moz-saturate&quot; (or called &quot;over&quot; if they had a good reason) (according 
</I>&gt;<i> to that &quot;should&quot;) but nobody would be able to ever use it (according to 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;must&quot;s).
</I>
That's exactly correct. Using extensions make the script non-conforming, 
but providing them doesn't make the UA non-conforming.


&gt;<i> &quot;strings should be parsed as CSS &lt;color&gt; values&quot; - s/should/must/
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> The colour parsing refers to [CSS3COLOR]. No profile is described, so 
</I>&gt;<i> presumably all of CSS3 Color should be supported. In that case: what 
</I>&gt;<i> should &quot;currentColor&quot; do, since its CSS definition makes no sense here?
</I>
It makes sense -- it's the value of the 'color' property.


&gt;<i> (By the way, after reading CSS3 Color, I can appreciate WA1's writing 
</I>&gt;<i> style and the way that it doesn't have obvious errors and omissions and 
</I>&gt;<i> ABC...)
</I>
Heh. :-)


&gt;<i> &quot;Immediately before the 0 offset and immediately after the 1 offset, 
</I>&gt;<i> transparent black stops are be assumed.&quot; - syntax error, and should have 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;must&quot;.
</I>
That text is now gone.


&gt;<i> &quot;Once a gradient has been created (see below), stops must be placed 
</I>&gt;<i> along it to define how the colors are distributed along the gradient.&quot; - 
</I>&gt;<i> is that meant to be &quot;must&quot;? (i.e. authors are non-conforming if they 
</I>&gt;<i> don't specify any stops and use the all-transparent-black behaviour.)
</I>
That should be better now.


&gt;<i> &quot;attribute DOMString shadowColor; // (default black)&quot; - later it says 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;transparent black&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;attribute DOMString globalCompositeOperation; // (default over)&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> later it says &quot;source-over&quot;.
</I>
Fixed.
