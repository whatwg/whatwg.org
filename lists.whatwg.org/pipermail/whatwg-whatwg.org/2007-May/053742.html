But I thought the idea was that there is to be one HTML, with such
well-defined error handling for UAs that there will be no more modes except
The One Mode.

&gt;<i> [...] Because we implemented

</I>
Well, that's web publishers breaking their own sites. But I understand what
you mean, in that a group of end users will blame the UA.

Still, I'm not sure what the current situation is. An old, simple test case
of mine, at &lt;<A HREF="http://santek.no-ip.org/~st/tests/contenttype/">http://santek.no-ip.org/~st/tests/contenttype/</A>&gt;, shows that now
in fact more UAs respect that Content-Type header's MIME type than when I
originally put it up. (WebKit now does respect that Content-Type.) That gives
me the impression that most UAs that are not IE do respect the Content-Type's
mime type, and makes me wonder what the problem really is.

Maybe that test case doesn't reflect the reality that some people here are
talking about?

[...Content-Type in general...]

&gt;<i> This was about loading style sheet resources. User agents know when
</I>&gt;<i> they're doing that. The same goes for loading image resources (from &lt;img&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> or background-image).
</I>
Hm... right. OK, it might indeed be that when CSS is linked to through the
link element, or @import, it may be safe to ignore the Content-Type header's
MIME type. Ignoring the HTTP status would seem to be another thing though. I
mean, surely something like a 301 or 307 would have to be respected.

But Ian seems to be talking about Content-Type in general, not just for Style
Sheets.

So I'm trying to understand exactly what is being proposed here. To do away
with Content-Type exactly where? To ignore Content-Type entirely (in specific
situations), or to ignore it only when its value makes no sense, and if so,
what's the definition of &quot;sense&quot;?
