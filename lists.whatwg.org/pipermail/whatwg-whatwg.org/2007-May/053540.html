I haven't added any of these (relative moves and path introspection) in 
this version of the API. I'm not sure they're actually really needed. You 
could relatively easily put a layer to do it on top of the API if you 
wanted. This would fall into the same category as making a layer that uses 
polar coordinates.

</I>
Based on the above, I've left the spec as is for now (it's what Opera 
implements); but I've contact the browser vendors about this and I'm 
looking into it as we speak. Check the spec for updates to this issue.

Per the above discussion, I haven't added anything to store paths yet.

There's still no way to _get_ the transformation matrix, but you can not 
_set_ the transformation matrix now, which should be of help here.
