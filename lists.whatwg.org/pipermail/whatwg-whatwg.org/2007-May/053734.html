Great.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> That may be the case, but you are e-mailing the WHATWG here, not the HTML

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (In point of fact, however, I would imagine that if the HTML working group

</I>&gt;<i> I'm working on isn't that spec, then I'll stop working on it, and return 
</I>&gt;<i> to working on the spec with real-world relevance.)
</I>
But that's exactly the UA-centric nature of the WHATWG specs that I 
don't like (and I don't think I'm alone). A spec that spends 75% of it's 
space to specify error recovery for UAs is IMHO not the optimal place to 
specify the semantics of HTML.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> The entire point of specifications is to remove decisions like that from 
</I>&gt;<i> the implementors. :-)
</I>
Sometimes, but I don't think it's the case here.

A MUST level requirement to ignore the content-type forces an 
implementor to either break RFC2616 or HTML5. Am I the only one who 
thinks that the &quot;all-specification-decisions-belong-to-us&quot; philosophy is 
problematic, when it affects other parts of the protocol stack?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you think that this is wrong, you'll have to try to change *that* 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I know you tried...), but just ignoring it in a W3C spec is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unlikely to be accepted.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Accepted by whom? The browser vendors are the main &quot;clients&quot; of this 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spec. Why would they not accept something that described what they had 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to do?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Accepted by the W3C.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't particularly care if the W3C accepts or doesn't accept the HTML5 
</I>&gt;<i> spec. They're not the ones who have to implement the spec, or who will 
</I>&gt;<i> decide how successful the specification is. It's the browser vendors who 
</I>&gt;<i> have that role.
</I>
Yes, but I thought the &quot;plan&quot; was to take HTML5 and take it through the 
W3C process? So, if you don't care, why did you volunteer to edit that spec?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The _TAG findings_ are what haven't been accepted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you want to proceed with this activity inside the W3C, I think you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really can't ignore what's been stated before. I don't see how HTML5 (as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a W3C spec) can be incompatible with that TAG finding -- one or both 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will need to change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy for the TAG finding to change. The HTML5 spec can't change, 
</I>&gt;<i> since it is constrained by the large amount of existing content.
</I>
That discussion will take place on the W3C HTML mailing list then.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) I recall one instance where a WHATWG member requested a change in a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mail to the former HTTP WG's mailing list, and as far as I can recall, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he/she failed to get support for that (was it Content-Location?). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, please provide a more precise pointer, or follow up on that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Content-Location is the prime example I was thinking of, yes.
</I>
The mailing list thread is at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2006OctDec/thread.html#msg190">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2006OctDec/thread.html#msg190</A>&gt;. 
  I don't think it was discussed to the end, but on the other hand I 
also don't see any kind of consensus to make a change. Maybe you should 
restart it then.

&gt;<i>...

Best regards, Julian
