<PRE>I understand the idea that classes were supposed to have semantics all
along -- though i don't think that idea is necessarily borne out by
the spec -- but the issue, for me, is NAMESPACING (whether formally
defined or otherwise). If i'm using class=&quot;navigation&quot; and
class=&quot;copyright&quot; (to use two overused examples from this long
discussion) in my projects from 2003 (before the mechanism went into
effect), i don't necessarily want parsers in 2008 to make assumptions
based on that. And there's no way to tell them NOT to.

If we could NAMESPACE the predefined class names, that'd actually
remove ALL my objections to the idea of overloading /class/ instead of
creating a new attribute (/role/ or whatever). But unfortunately, that
totally breaks backwards-compatibility if not done very carefully. (If
i declare class=&quot;dc:author&quot; , i CAN'T address that in my stylesheet.
If the namespacing was handled with dashes, like class=&quot;dc-author&quot;,
that would work, though.)

The advantage of tying into the W3C's /role/ idea is that /role/ is
already defined to allow for explicit namespacing. But again, this
COULD, i suppose, be handled with class names, if there were an
explicit namespacing mechanism there too.

I REALLY DO like the idea of an attribute to add specified semantics
to content blocks. Let's not abandon that idea entirely!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd tend to think there are use cases where class is most appropriate
