if I read the current draft correctly, that resource should still be sniffed
as text/plain.  That's what I meant by &quot;the harm can be mitigated by the
rules in the spec&quot;.

I would propose that the &quot;type&quot; attribute be more meaningful on, for
example, the &lt;a&gt; element and the &lt;object&gt; element:
- If the &quot;type&quot; attribute is present, the UA must use its value as the value
of the Accept request header when requesting a resource

And then apply sniffing rules that take the Accept request header into
account (including wildcards in the Accept header):
- If the Accept request header accepts text/plain and not text/html, and the
Content-type response header is text/plain, it must not be sniffed as HTML.
- If the Accept request header does accept text/html, and the Content-type
response header is text/plain, it may be sniffed as HTML.

That would allow, for example, Bugzilla to use &lt;a type=&quot;text/plain&quot;&gt; when
linking to an attachment without fear that the attachment might be sniffed
as text/html.

I don't know how that would break existing content, but I did want to
mention it.  I don't think the &quot;type&quot; attribute is currently abused,
especially on links, in a way that would make this harmful.
