<PRE>Hello Hixie!

Again, thanks for replying to one of my very old emails. Also, note the  
email address change.

I'm skeptical about UAs implementing the outline algorithm.

If there would have been a very high demand for UAs to implement some kind  
of document outlining algorithms, that would have happend already, with or  
without any standard algorithm.

However, we have seen sites which create their own document outlines. Why?  
Because the demand was even higher. I've created my own document outlines,  
specific to my documents (either manually, or scripted).

Also, let's look at UserJS, Widgets and even UserCSS. I've seen UserJS  
scripts which generate document outlines, same goes for CSS. Of course,  
CSS is very limited compared to JS - but yes, I've seen such user styles.  
Given Widgets are small web application packages (HTML+CSS+JS+etc), it is  
conceivable some of them will also need document outlining.

I agree there's a demand for document outlining within an UA, but that's  
all theoretical, in ones imagination. I did think long time ago, and I  
still do, about how good would be to have UAs which implement document  
outlining and several other features which would really make *semantics*  
more obvious for the average Jane/Joe user. Yet, *today* the &quot;need&quot; is on  
the web.

Cheers,
Mihai
