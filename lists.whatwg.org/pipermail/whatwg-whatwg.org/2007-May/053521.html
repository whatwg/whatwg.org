</I>
Given that the two first &lt;canvas&gt; implementors are against this change, 
and that the request doesn't introduce a new feature per se, and that 
there are a number of ways to obtain the desired language style even with 
the current spec, and that the DOM APIs don't generally use this calling 
style anyway, I'm going to opt for not changing the spec at this stage.

I understand that this isn't what everyone wanted, and I understand that 
chaining calls is a common idiom in other contexts. The cost of changing 
the spec at this point is just higher than the potential benefit, in my 
opinion. (The cost is quite high, mostly in terms of testing.)
