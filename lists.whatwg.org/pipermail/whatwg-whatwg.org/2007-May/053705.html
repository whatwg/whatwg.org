</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Actually, I wasn't planning to. I think that that finding is a good

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I recommend reading the first of the two links cited above. It

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why I think that it's a lost cause.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I read those messages when they were written.
</I>
Ok, then you know that I have attempted to do the &quot;work&quot; you propose we 
do. What more work can we do?


&gt;<i> * I do understand that there's a gap between what the specs say 
</I>&gt;<i> Content-Type should do, and what works in reality.
</I>
Indeed. And the specs, to be useful, have to match reality.


&gt;<i> * As we just saw with the XSLT example, making generalizations like in 
</I>&gt;<i> Anne's proposal is dangerous: for instance, Mozilla does check the 
</I>&gt;<i> content type of XSLT style sheets, and it seems people can live with 
</I>&gt;<i> that. In this particular case, XSLT content was served with type 
</I>&gt;<i> text/html, and when the problem was discovered, the author immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed the server config.
</I>
The HTML5 spec requires that Content-Type headers be obeyed everywhere 
where I could possibly get away with requiring it. It only ignores it 
where reality requires it.


&gt;<i> * I think it would be bad if the W3C TAG finding on media types and a 
</I>&gt;<i> future W3C HTML spec would contradict each other.
</I>
It would be worse if reality and the future HTML spec contradicted each 
other. (It is already quite bad that the TAG finding contradicts reality.)


&gt;<i> * I agree that it is a good thing to collect information about what UA 
</I>&gt;<i> implementors need to do to be compatible with deployed content on the 
</I>&gt;<i> web. On the other hand, I disagree that it's a good idea to include this 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff as normative information into an HTML spec.
</I>
&quot;Normative&quot; means &quot;what UA implementors need to do&quot;. Your statements, at 
least in the context of this work, iare self-contradictory. There's no 
point us making the spec be something that we know browser vendors have to 
ignore. We're not writing science fiction. We're writing a specification.
