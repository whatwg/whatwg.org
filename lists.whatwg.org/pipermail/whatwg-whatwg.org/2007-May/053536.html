Unfortunately, while authors like yourself are competent and can use these 
features correctly, a great number of people cannot. Such features end up, 
on many pages, being used incorrectly, sub-optimally, and in some cases 
cripplingly -- causing browsers that support these features to render 
certain sites significantly worse or slower (or both) than browsers who 
ignore these flags and instead apply heuristics to determine the optimal 
rendering modes.

Because of this, we can't really put these features in the spec -- they 
would just end up being abused, then ignored.

Indeed, a further argument is that there are existing workarounds.

Indeed, a further argument is that future displays will make this 
irrelevant anyway.

Indeed. But my point was that most authors would be unable to make a 
correct determination of the appropriate choice, and would pick randomly, 
with the results described above.

While this is a valid use case, it is one that the browsers can themselves 
optimise -- e.g. by not performing the requested paints synchronously, but 
instead buffering them and determining which need anti-aliasing and which 
do not. Thus we do not need to provide controls for this level of detail.


Thanks for the feedback,
