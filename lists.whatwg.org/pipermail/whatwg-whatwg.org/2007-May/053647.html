I was one of the people who said the use cases weren't convincing. :-)


&gt;<i> Also, &lt;script defer&gt; as defined in HTML5 gives you the exact same

</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I don't think it's a huge problem to add it, but you

I did quite a lot of research before defining it. There's content 
depending on it. Two browsers support it, and workarounds are hacked into 
libraries to fake it for the two other browsers, including one that 
supports &lt;script defer&gt;. (The workaround is a &lt;script defer&gt;, but based on 
how people are using it it's not exactly what people are looking for.)

I agree it doesn't have strong use cases; XBL handles things like widgets 
better. But it's cheap, simple, interoperably implemented, and used. Seems 
like a no-brainer to me.
