</I>
Fixed, but not that way. Let me know if it's ok.

</I>
Specifically for transform(), setTransform(), scale(), and translate(), 
I've made Infinity cause the canvas to stop drawing instead of raising an 
exception. Everything else, exceptions.

Fixed.

Fixed by adding a general rule to the conformance section.

1, 3, and b now raise exceptions except if otherwise specified. I haven't 
yet defined 2. I'm not sure what it should say.
