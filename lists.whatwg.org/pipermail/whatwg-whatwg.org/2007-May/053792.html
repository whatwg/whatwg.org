<PRE>On May 17th in #whatwg, Ian said:

</I>&gt;<i> -401-instead-of-xhtml/#comment-23 (same article)
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Hixie&gt; the last comment on that blog entry highlights one of the  
</I>&gt;<i> weirdest things i've repeatedly seen on the web
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Hixie&gt; &quot;HTML 5.0 vs XHTML 2.0 (commercials companies vs W3C)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Hixie&gt; the idea that the W3C, which you have to pay thousands of  
</I>&gt;<i> dollars to to become a member, and which is entirely member-driven, is  
</I>&gt;<i> somehow less &quot;commercial&quot; than the WHATWG, which can be joined by  
</I>&gt;<i> anyone
</I>
I've also seen this occasionally, and it occurs to me now that the  
WhatWG Web site may be to blame. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/charter#member">http://www.whatwg.org/charter#member</A>&gt;  
says:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Membership is by invitation only, and consists of a number of  
</I>&gt;<i> representatives from various browser manufacturers. This group, which  
</I>&gt;<i> is referred to as the members, will provide overall guidance as  
</I>&gt;<i> described in the charter above.
</I>
This is trivially false: the member list includes Dean Edwards, who is  
not a representative of a browser manufacturer. More importantly,  
though, it does not make clear the difference between a WhatWG member  
and a W3C Member. And it apparently precludes, for example,  
accessibility aid developers from being invited as members.

Another problem with the charter itself is in this section:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During development, the working group may decide that a document has  
</I>&gt;<i> reached a stable stage and is in need of wider review. At this point  
</I>&gt;<i> the document will be archived in its current state, and a  
</I>&gt;<i> call-for-comments will be announced. Drafts in this stage should bear  
</I>&gt;<i> a warning informing readers that the specification is not considered  
</I>&gt;<i> ready for non-experimental implementations, and that experimental  
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of the draft must not be included in end-user  
</I>&gt;<i> products.
</I>
Such a warning would undoubtedly be ignored, which would reflect poorly  
on the specification. For example, browser vendors would not suddenly  
remove the &lt;canvas&gt; support they already include in end-user products  
because a call-for-comments had been issued for the &lt;canvas&gt;  
specification. The warning that is currently used in the HTML 5  
specification itself is much more realistic: &quot;Implementors who are not  
taking part in the discussions are likely to find the specification  
changing out from under them in incompatible ways.&quot;

Finally, the charter should be updated to refer to HTML 5 rather than  
Web Forms 2.0 and Web Applications 1.0.
