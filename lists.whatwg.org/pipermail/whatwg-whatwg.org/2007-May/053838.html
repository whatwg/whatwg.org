</I>
I don't see us using a sandboxing system that isn't based on browsing 
contexts, in which case this is moot.

</I>
True, we should avoid that where possible. (Sometimes, e.g. the MIME type 
sniffing stuff, we are constrained by the legacy implementations.)

This presumably wouldn't be needed with browsing context based sandboxes.

</I>
Indeed.

</I>
This seems to be off the grid now. Is there a copy I can look at 
somewhere?

Generally we want to avoid adding any more processing modes.

</I>&gt;<i> This is true, but there is a problem with the whitelisting approach: the

</I>&gt;<i> elements and attributes which must be removed to prohibit scripting:

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;javascript:&quot;.
</I>
You must also white-list attribute values, indeed. And this would mean 
checking URI syntax (for instance) and whitelisting URI schemes.


&gt;<i> While filtering the DOM tree by the HTML cleaner is easy, it approaches 
</I>&gt;<i> the problem from the syntax point of view, not semantic. It's more 
</I>&gt;<i> robust to write something like &lt;sandbox scripting=&quot;disallow&quot;&gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> disallow all scripting within the sandbox, including any obscure or 
</I>&gt;<i> future flavors of scripts as well as those enabled by proprietary 
</I>&gt;<i> extensions (like MSIE's &quot;expression()&quot; in CSS). Browser developers know 
</I>&gt;<i> better what makes &quot;all possible kinds of scripts&quot; than the web 
</I>&gt;<i> application developers.
</I>
Indeed, sandboxing (probably using &lt;iframe&gt;) is something we'll look at.


&gt;<i> Returning to the duplicate IDs, I think we should define some standard 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior for getElementById() when there is more than one element with 
</I>&gt;<i> the given ID. To lower the possible extent of duplicate ID attacks, I 
</I>&gt;<i> propose that getElementById() should throw an exception in that case. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's better to crash the script than to make it do what the attacker 
</I>&gt;<i> wants.
</I>
We can't make it raise an exception; pages depend on this already.

I did some research a few months back, and in a sample of several billion 
documents, 13% had duplicate IDs. 13%!

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, getElementById is already defined to deal with duplicate IDs by

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, the implementations (major User Agents: Opera, Gecko, Konqueror and

</I>&gt;<i> as stated by Alexey in the message starting this thread.
</I>
Defining something that doesn't match what pages rely on clearly isn't 
going to work (since the browser vendors would just ignore us). DOM3 Core 
is being ignored, and we should change it.

It can be changed. A REC that is ignored is worthless.

I have omitted a bunch of stuff that didn't seem relevant. Please let me 
know if you think I skipped something in this thread that you wanted 
considered for the spec.

I've noted some things given in this thread for changes to DOM Core, 
in case that becomes something we need to look at.
