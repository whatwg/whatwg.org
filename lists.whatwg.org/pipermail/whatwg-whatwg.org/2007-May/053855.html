Ah, indeed, that would be a good place to reference that. Noted.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2.20.1. When I read this, I had trouble organizing (in my mind) what 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I was reading because I had no prior understanding of where the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; was going. Up to this point, I had had prior hypotheses that were 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; confirmed or disconfirmed by the spec. This section would be a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; easier to read if it had an introductionary paragraph stating the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; relationship of rendering, the DOM, the data model object and data 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; submission. (Is the DOM being rendered or is a replaced widget 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; element being rendered? Is it stylable? Is the data model reflected 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; back to the DOM? What's the expected way of serializing the data 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; model and sending it back to the server?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know which section this is talking about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was about &lt;datagrid&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it better now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the non-normative intro section still doesn't sufficiently cover 
</I>&gt;<i> the relationship to the DOM and the CSS frame tree.
</I>
The relationship to CSS will all be in the rendering section.

I guess I don't really know what you think is needed in the intro section, 
I'm probably too close to it. Could you write some questions that you 
think an intro section should answer?


&gt;<i> It wasn't clear to me why the spec specified datagrid as part of 
</I>&gt;<i> required UA functionality instead of e.g. Google shipping an Open Source 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript library that implements the whole thing using existing stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> available in browsers. Is this about particular native widgets? About 
</I>&gt;<i> performance?
</I>
Both of those, but also simply semantics (spelt &quot;accessibility&quot; for 
political correctness reasons).


&gt;<i> I thought there might be a requirement that the content made sense as a 
</I>&gt;<i> data model.
</I>
I think that would be excessive. It might be a good idea, though.


&gt;<i> &gt; Do you think it should be further restricted?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessary, I guess.
</I>
Ok.
