&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The entire thing has to degrade SAFELY in existing browsers. With

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not acceptable.

&gt;<i> This probably depends on the use cases in question. For some use cases,

A security feature, by definition, protects the users from a certain class  
of attacks. An attack needs to be only successful in one browser to do  
harm. For example, a malicious advertising script which actually steals  
passwords entered by users on the host page is dangerous enough even if  
the attacker only succeeds in stealing passwords of just a fraction of the  
users.

I can't really imagine a scenario in which sandbox restrictions could be  
somehow considered optional. Wherever there is need for such restrictions,  
it's unacceptable to run the script without them implemented.

&gt;<i> This is unfortunately far too complicated. It basically duplicates most  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;iframe&gt; security and DOM model, which itself has been a big source  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> bugs over the years.
</I>
Yes, that's the idea (about the duplication, not about the bugs).

&gt;<i> Actually the origin-checking in browsers is simpler than that. It only
</I>&gt;<i> happens at certain very specific places, namely the Window interface  
</I>&gt;<i> entry
</I>&gt;<i> points. If we want to add a security model here, it has to be at the
</I>&gt;<i> Window level, which basically means a new browsing context.
</I>
I should probably have named the element &lt;browsingcontext&gt;.

The key differences from &lt;iframe&gt; are:

1. Doesn't require loading of a separate document via a separate HTTP  
request, and without the ugliness of data: URIs. If there was some  
&quot;inline&quot; version of &lt;iframe&gt;, such as &lt;iframe&gt;content&lt;/iframe&gt;, that would  
be just fine.

2. Implements the security barrier even though the inner content doesn't  
come from a different domain. &lt;iframe&gt; would require a separate domain for  
that.

3. The security barrier is asymmetric, i.e. the outer scripts have access  
to the inner content, but not the other way round.

&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, there is a lot more to think and talk about. I suppose there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are going to be problems with particular buggy implementations of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sandboxing and exploits specifically targetted at holes in such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementations. I suspect that web application authors and site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administrators will be hesitant to allow user scripting even in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sandboxes because of the possible browser bugs.
</I>
&gt;<i> Because of this, we really want to make sure we leverage as much of the
</I>&gt;<i> existing infrastructure as possible. I'm worried that the DOMSandbox  
</I>&gt;<i> idea,
</I>&gt;<i> with its &quot;fake&quot; documents, etc, introduces too much complexity.
</I>
You're drawing parallels between sandboxing and &lt;iframe&gt;. If the  
shortcomings of &lt;iframe&gt; listed above can be alleviated, it would be just  
fine.

&gt;&gt;<i> I propose to define the notion of &quot;side effect free script&quot;. All
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsers which allow scripts in declarations like CSS should only allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side effect free scripts in such places.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> 2. It can call any non-native function, but the same restrictions apply.
</I>
&gt;<i> So it can get hold of data that the rest of the page has created, or is
</I>&gt;<i> storing in its temporary variables (e.g. it can get hold of your calendar
</I>&gt;<i> data if you're looking at an online calendar application).
</I>
No, it's impossible to store any data permanently in a thread which is in  
SEF mode. Only locals can be assigned, and they aren't going to last  
longer than the thread anyway.

&gt;<i> With the above you could still do something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;a style=&quot;display: expression(...)&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;<A HREF="http://evil.example.com?a">http://evil.example.com?a</A>&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;a style=&quot;display: expression(...)&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;<A HREF="http://evil.example.com?b">http://evil.example.com?b</A>&quot;&gt;b&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...where the first &quot;...&quot; script returns 'none' to convey one piece of
</I>&gt;<i> information and 'block' to convey another, and the second is the reverse;
</I>&gt;<i> the user who clicks on the link then exposes the bit of information the
</I>&gt;<i> script was trying to steal. I'm sure there are more powerful attacks as
</I>&gt;<i> well, e.g. using href=javascript: to return an HTML page with script.
</I>
Even easier: background: url(expression(...)).

I see your point.

&gt;<i> In short, the complexity is high, as is the risk that it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive. Also, it seems to me that most scripts want to do  
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> more fancy. For example, a calendar widget will want to talk to its
</I>&gt;<i> server, render new DOMs, interact with the user, etc. What's the use case
</I>&gt;<i> for these scripts? Are they common enough to warrant their own security
</I>&gt;<i> model?
</I>
It's not for most scripts. It's basically only for expression() in CSS,  
which is generally a good thing, if only it can be made impossible to do  
use it for bad purposes. And this whole SEF idea is not really relevant to  
sandboxing.

&gt;&gt;<i> Frames are a terrible solution. The content is after all a part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page it's hosted in, but we want to sandbox it to make sure it can't do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any harm.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's say we'd like to sandbox anonymous user-contributed comments on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blog, but not comments from logged in users. That would require all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anonymous comments to be placed within an iframe. For 100 anonymous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comments, that's 100 iframes on a single web page. Don't tell me that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an elegant solution.
</I>
&gt;<i> Why not? Or rather, why is a 100 &lt;sandbox&gt; frames (or whatever) better?
</I>
1. Because it doesn't require 100 HTTP requests to load the page.

2. Because it doesn't require a separate domain to serve the iframe  
content from.

These two are major, and there are also several minor issues (some sizing  
problems with iframes, as pointed out by Charles; stylesheet propagation  
into sandboxes; strict symmetry of restrictions on iframes).

&gt;<i> We can't do something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Hello, you said:
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;sandbox&gt;Hello World&lt;/sandbox&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...because nothing stops the user from inserting &quot;&lt;/sandbox&gt;&quot; into the
</I>&gt;<i> string -- e.g. if the user tried to insert
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&lt;/sandbox&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(window.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&quot; the result would be:
</I>
All attempts to treat user-submitted HTML as a string are doomed to having  
such vulnerabilities. &lt;sandbox&gt; alone doesn't add much to this problem.  
Just look at how complex is the HTML sanitizer in LiveJournal which allows  
some user-submitted markup but not all.

The only ultimate solution here is to parse the user-submitted HTML with  
an HTML5 parser and reserialize it. The string  
&quot;&lt;/sandbox&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(window.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&quot; would parse into one  
&lt;script&gt; element with a text node inside (stray &lt;/sandbox&gt; at the start  
gets ignored), and reserialize as &quot;&lt;script&gt;alert(window.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&quot;.  
That's the only reasonable way (apart from completely escaping all &lt;&gt;&quot;&amp;  
characters) to include ANY user-submitted string into generated HTML, with  
or without &lt;sandbox&gt;.

&gt;<i> The sanest way I can see of limiting scripting is to give it its own
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context (aka scripting context, or global scope). Anything short
</I>&gt;<i> of this would make the security model overly complicated -- the security
</I>&gt;<i> model is what we want to keep at its simplest, as I've said several times
</I>&gt;<i> in this e-mail.
</I>
&lt;sandbox&gt; would indeed be one, just with the content supplied inline.

&gt;<i> This basically implies an &lt;iframe&gt;, again possibly with the data in a
</I>&gt;<i> data: URI, and combined with a way to ioslate the content in the &lt;iframe&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> from the content of the parent browsing context:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;iframe  
</I>&gt;<i> src=&quot;data:text/html;base64,PHA%2BVGhpcyBpcyBteSBzYW1wbGUgbWFya3VwITwvcD4%3D&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>            isolate-scripts
</I>&gt;<i>    &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</I>
data: URIs are maybe appropriate for a small list-bullet PNG, but not for  
a blog entry or comment. They are ugly and impossible to read and write  
without machine conversion. Any element that lets you write the HTML  
content inside, be it &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;sandbox&gt; or something else, would be OK.

&gt;<i> The names above are a bit long; here's a summary of what the four modes
</I>&gt;<i> could be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    seamless - if present, styles cascade through the browsing context
</I>&gt;<i>    boundary; ignored if the origin doesn't match the parent's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    noscript - disables all scripts in the embedded page
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    isolate - make the origin of the file not match the parent's,
</I>&gt;<i>    regardless of the real origins
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    restrict - disable certain APIs in the browsing context
</I>
These make a nice list of toggle attributes for the &lt;sandbox&gt; element.
