</I>&gt;<i> I've just finished taking a look at the working draft of HTML 5 and 
</I>&gt;<i> thought I'd share my thoughts. Clearly, HTML 5 is meant as an evolution 
</I>&gt;<i> of HTML 4, which has both its good and bad points. Accordingly, there 
</I>&gt;<i> are both good and bad parts of the specification. My thoughts are as 
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>
(I've omitted replies to some parts of your e-mail. I have saved your 
e-mail for further replies to those sections later.)

&gt;<i>     * I understand the concept of the &lt;dialog/&gt; element but it's named 
</I>&gt;<i> completely wrong. The point is to markup a conversation between two or 
</I>&gt;<i> more parties. The problem is that the word &quot;dialog&quot;, when in used in 
</I>&gt;<i> user interfaces, refers to small windows that can be interacted with. 
</I>&gt;<i> When I first read about this element, I assumed it was a way to indicate 
</I>&gt;<i> that part of the page is a dialog window outside of the normal flow of 
</I>&gt;<i> the document (which I thought was cool). After reading the rest, I was 
</I>&gt;<i> disappointed to find out that wasn't the intent. I'd rename this element 
</I>&gt;<i> as &lt;conversation/&gt; or &lt;discussion/&gt; to avoid such misunderstandings.
</I>
I agree that the name is suboptimal but those names are worse (they're too 
long, and they're overly specific). I'm not sure what to do about this.


&gt;<i>     * The &lt;dfn/&gt; is another that stresses the understanding of 
</I>&gt;<i> grammatical structure for web developers. The intent is to designate the 
</I>&gt;<i> defining instance of a term, abberviation, or acronym. Does that make 
</I>&gt;<i> sense to you? If it did, give yourself one point; if it didn't, don't 
</I>&gt;<i> feel bad, most people won't get it. Again, any element that leaves 
</I>&gt;<i> people scratching their heads probably isn't necessary or useful.
</I>
&lt;dfn&gt; doesn't have to be used, but for certain cases it's very useful. I 
don't think it's a problem to keep it.


&gt;<i>     * Speaking of confusing, I've read the section about the &lt;meter/&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element five times now and still have no idea what it's used for.
</I>
I don't know how to improve the current text. Does the example showing the 
newsgroups activity help at all?

The real reason for &lt;meter&gt; is that we need to make sure people don't 
abuse &lt;progress&gt; just to show gauges (e.g. disk space usage). Does that 
make sense? How should we go about better describing this?


&gt;<i>     * I'd like to see some treatment of rich text input controls. Right 
</I>&gt;<i> now we all use a hack (an iframe in design mode) that has to be copied 
</I>&gt;<i> over into a form field to be submitted. It would be nice to have this 
</I>&gt;<i> handled natively and have reliable HTML formatting of that content 
</I>&gt;<i> (instead of the per-browser implementations we have now).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also &quot;contenteditable&quot; doesn't solve my issue with rich text editing. It 
</I>&gt;<i> solves the ability to do it, but not a straightforward way to do it in 
</I>&gt;<i> the context of a form and submit it back to the server without some 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediary code. My point is that there should be a way to submit rich 
</I>&gt;<i> text in a form by default, without needing to write extra JavaScript 
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>
The problem is that while everyone seems to want a rich text control, 
nobody seems to agree on exactly what it should allow. Thus 
contenteditable, and the ability for people to roll their own.


&gt;<i>     * I'd like to see a common attribute that can be used on any element 
</I>&gt;<i> to indicate information related to the element. I'm tired of fighting 
</I>&gt;<i> the custom attribute battle. The fact is that it's a very common need to 
</I>&gt;<i> include extra data related to an element. I'd propose a &quot;reldata&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute (short for &quot;related data&quot;) be considered as an optional 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute on all elements. We then, as developers, could use that 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute as we see fit and the document would still validate (for 
</I>&gt;<i> people who care about such things). 
</I>
We recently added data-*=&quot;&quot;, does that help?
