</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.duttondirect.com/automotive/for_sale">http://www.duttondirect.com/automotive/for_sale</A> (disclaimer: I am not
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for the design of this page)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The table hover effect is not easily acheived without global href. My
</I>&gt;<i> client likes it, the users like it and it is perfectly obvious navigation
</I>&gt;<i> (despite being non-standard). At the moment I am acheiving the effect with
</I>&gt;<i> event bubbling but I consider this approach to be bloated, ineligant, prone
</I>&gt;<i> to breakage and lag on slower devices. It also suffers from the poor
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility of the event.button property (activates on right/middle-click
</I>&gt;<i> instead of just left). Nonetheless it improves the ease of navigation for
</I>&gt;<i> most users.
</I>
This is a good point - that style of navigation is indeed very easy and
intuitive for people to use.  You *want* to click on the whole row,
especially with the nice color change on hover; making any particular piece
of the row the 'clickable' portion would actually reduce usability.

&gt;<i> A global href would allow me too turn the whole mess of event code into:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;tr href=&quot;foo.html&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/tr&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... and all the issues I just mentioned would vanish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>However, I'm still quite aware of the issues with making href= global, which
have been brought up before (the big thing is that href doesn't work in
isolation - it's got a whole bevy of cousin attributes that would have to
move to global as well).

However, has there ever been a  response from browser authors about just
making &lt;a&gt; allow block-level content within it?  The main issue I can think
of with this is default UI - how should it be indicated that a block-level
element is a link?  It's pretty well-established that authors generally hate
the border around images within an &lt;a&gt; (my default stylesheet turns off
image borders just for that reason).  However, it at least gives *some*
indication of a link - should we be bordering all the block-level elements
(and underlining all the inline) within an &lt;a&gt;?  It would be an ugly
default, but one that can be removed pretty trivially - a simple &quot;a * {
border: none; }&quot; rule would remove it and let you style your stuff as you
wish.

As far as I can tell a block-level &lt;a&gt; is already supported just fine, as
you *can* wrap block-level content in an &lt;a&gt; and have it work as expected
right now, and CSSing an &lt;a&gt; into display:block works wonderfully.  It
*appears* that only the standard disallows this at the moment - the actual
browsers handle it just fine.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People on this list should be very careful about claiming properties and
</I>&gt;<i> tags will be abused. Bad interfaces exist already and often as a result of
</I>&gt;<i> missing behaviours in the standard. Wrapping tables and block content in
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is just one example (it works, believe it or not). Trying to force
</I>&gt;<i> designers into better layouts by denying features is stupid. It will simply
</I>&gt;<i> drive them into invalid layouts, Javascript, Flash or Silverlight where they
</I>&gt;<i> are free to make even bigger mockeries of standards and interface
</I>&gt;<i> conventions. As far as designers are concerned HTML5 is a *competitor* to
</I>&gt;<i> these technologies. If you cannot compete in terms of features and ease of
</I>&gt;<i> use you'll end up with a proprietary web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary then:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is global href going to create bad layouts?
</I>&gt;<i> Depends. Skilled UI designers can improve their layouts - bad designers can
</I>&gt;<i> make theirs worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is global href a burden on browser vendors?
</I>&gt;<i> Unlikely. It's behaviour is nearly identical to
</I>&gt;<i> onclick=&quot;window.location=foo&quot; which is already supported on the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> modern browsers except Lynx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is denying designers features they want going to increase standards
</I>&gt;<i> compliance?
</I>&gt;<i> No. It will reduce compliance.
</I>&gt;<i>
