I prefer the current text.

Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;The term root element, when not qualified to explicitly refer to the

</I>&gt;<i> The term root element, unless qualified explicitly to refer to the

</I>&gt;<i> root element is the document's root element. Otherwise, its root element 
</I>&gt;<i> is an orphaned node.
</I>
Fixed a bit, but not as much as you wanted.


&gt;<i> &quot;Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical reasons, 
</I>&gt;<i> require the user agent to pause until some condition has been met. While 
</I>&gt;<i> a user agent is paused, it must ensure that no scripts execute (e.g. no 
</I>&gt;<i> event handlers, no timers, etc). User agents should remain responsive to 
</I>&gt;<i> user input while paused, however.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How should a user agent respond to user input that would cause an event 
</I>&gt;<i> handler to fire, like clicking on a button?
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> 1.4.1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Generally speaking, authors are discouraged from trying to use XML on 
</I>&gt;<i> the Web, because XML has much stricter syntax rules than the &quot;HTML5&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> variant described above, and is relatively newer and therefore less 
</I>&gt;<i> mature.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Stricter syntax rules&quot; is often listed as an advantage of XML. If 
</I>&gt;<i> you're going to list it as a disadvantage, for credibility's sake, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think you should say something about why it's a disadvantage.
</I>
This section was removed altogether.


&gt;<i> 2.1.1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The referrer attribute must return either the URI of the page which 
</I>&gt;<i> navigated the browsing context to the current document (if any), or the 
</I>&gt;<i> empty string (if there is no such originating page, or if the UA has 
</I>&gt;<i> been configured not to report referrers).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might help clarity to mention that a UA will intentionally hide 
</I>&gt;<i> referrers for security reasons (even the UA is not generally configured 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not to report referrers&quot;).
</I>
Added a note.


&gt;<i> 3.3.3.1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;For instance, the script elements is allowed inside head elements&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, the script element is allowed inside the head element
</I>&gt;<i> (typo)
</I>
I don't understand the mistake.


&gt;<i> 3.3.2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Text, embedded content, and elements that annotate the text without 
</I>&gt;<i> introducing structural grouping. For example: a, meter, img.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if the examples followed the descriptions in order: 
</I>&gt;<i> [text], img, a.
</I>
This section appears to be gone.


&gt;<i> 3.12.4
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;By emphasising the first word, the statement implies that the kind of animal
</I>&gt;<i> under discussion is in question (maybe someone is asserting that dogs are
</I>&gt;<i> cute):&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ...implies that the kind of animal deserving to be called cute is in
</I>&gt;<i> question...
</I>&gt;<i> (The first formation suggests that the speaker is questioning whether he/she
</I>&gt;<i> is even talking about dogs and cats, not which one is cuter.)
</I>
I don't think this change particularly helps. The example is relatively 
clear. Do you disagree?


&gt;<i> 8.2.1
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;do not have to actually create a DOM Document object&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> do not actually have to create a DOM Document object
</I>&gt;<i> (split infinitive)
</I>
I prefer the split version.
