Generally speaking, on the Web, if there is a need people will work around 
the problem in obvious ways. To continue your analogy, if people wanted to 
get to the other side, they would use boats, they would swim, they would 
climb on the back of aligators, they would dig tunnels, etc.

In this particular area -- disambiguation of class names and other 
metadata fields -- we see very little in the way of people avoiding name 
clashes. Indeed, the rare times where a clash becomes a problem, the names 
are simply changed to avoid the problem.

It's possible that this will become more of a problem in future, but then 
that's when we should fix it -- when we know what the needs are. At the 
moment, any fix here would be based on theoretical concerns.
