<PRE>
I have introduced the following APIs:

   context.font
   context.textAlign
   context.textBaseline
   context.fillText()
   context.strokeText()
   context.measureText()

They are defined here:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#text">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#text</A>

I haven't provided a way to render text to or along a path, nor a way to 
do vertical text, nor a way to measure anything but the nominal layout 
width of text (e.g. there's no way to measure bounding boxes or get 
baseline metrics). I also haven't provided a way to render document 
fragments straight to a canvas.


Here is some of the feedback on canvas related to text. I have snipped the 
feedback that wasn't constructive or didn't provide anything beyond 
requests for features without use cases and rationale, or that just 
bickered back and forth without making progress. If I snipped something 
that you think I should have responded to, please let me know. (I did take 
everything into account, even the bits that I haven't included below.)

I haven't made many comments below, because I didn't really have much to 
say. There were a lot of proposals and requests, but at the end of the day 
there didn't seem to be strong arguments in favour of some things or other 
things, so I haven't tried to defend the proposed API I put in the spec 
relative to the other APIs that were proposed. (I did take the various 
proposals that were made into account, and tried to adopt the best parts 
of each one.)

If you have further feedback, please send comments to the list, as usual.

Done.

The API as designed can handle this if you pass it a maxWidth argument. 
The 'font' attribute can take multiple fonts, as in CSS.


&gt;<i> A process which might work is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Make a request to prepare some text with an ordered list of preferred

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * At some later point, ask the canvas to &quot;draw&quot; the descriptor at a 
</I>&gt;<i> given location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This allows for the browser to substitute other fonts while allowing the 
</I>&gt;<i> canvas-based app to adapt the display to the characteristics of the 
</I>&gt;<i> selected font.
</I>
The API vaguely does something like this.

Since people are doing text already using bitmap fonts, not including this 
API isn't helping accessibility. So this seems like a moot point. The 
authors who are responsible will provide accessible versions of the 
content regardless of whether the canvas contains text or not.

It seems that at least the font-size would be something you'd want to 
control in the code rendering the text, though I could see an argument for 
making the other aspects of fonts accessible from CSS... this seems a bit 
over-engineered though. I haven't provided this for now.


&gt;<i> fitTextToPath might be an interesting API too.

Indeed. I have noted something along these lines as a possible area to 
extend the API into in a future version.

I haven't done vertical text because CSS doesn't yet define how to render 
it. However, there is a drawVerticalText() method commented out in the 
spec that is intended to satisfy this which can be uncommented out when 
CSS defines how to do this.

Ruby, multiline layout, and other such complexities aren't handled by this

similar to the drawElement() proposal. I've added a note to this effect in 
the spec.

The API has a measureText() method, which right now just returns the 
layout width of the text, but which could in future be extended to support 
any other metrics we want to expose (e.g. the bounding box, the distance 
from the top of the em square to the top of the bounding box, the relative 
positions of the baselines, etc).

Thanks, this was quite useful.
