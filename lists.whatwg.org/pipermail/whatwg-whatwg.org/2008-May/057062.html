</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dialog/&gt; would be appropriate?
</I>
There are a number of other much more important conflicts between XForms 
and HTML at this point, I don't think this is a particularly big concern.

These have been suggested in recent threads.

I would imagine this would confuse more people than &lt;dialog&gt;.


&gt;<i> * &lt;speech&gt;
</I>
This has the same problem as &lt;talk&gt;, which was also suggested recently.


&gt;<i> * &lt;talking&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;converse&gt;
</I>
These are not in the same style (nouns) as other tags, which would lead to 
a language consistency problem.

I agree that the initial name, if that's all you see, has the opportunity 
to confuse, but once you read what the element was really for, did the 
confusion continue to be a problem?
