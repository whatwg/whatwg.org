This seems like something that UAs could optimise -- knowing what 
databases and what version each origin has seems similar to having 
immediate access to name/value pairs and to cookies, both of which are 
already synchronous. And making it use a callback would make this even 
less usable. :-)

What do other vendors think? Anyone?

I agree that these arguments might not be useful. I propose that we see 
what authors do and what browsers do and remove the feature if it turns 
out to be useless.

Added. Note that a full quota is not a reason to prevent access (disabled

It is not safe to do asynchronous things from onunload.

The right thing to do is use onbeforeunload, prompt the user to save, have 
the user cancel the load, save the data, and then have the user retry the 
close or navigation.

(Though note that onbeforeunload isn't yet specced.)

Right. Anything asynchronous runs the risk of being shut down when the

This was actually already defined, but I've moved it into its own

Yeah, this will be defined when we define the SQL language subset.

I've merged the two sections to avoid this inconsistency.

Clarified.

Well, the &quot;underlying DB architecture&quot; is part of the UA, so the UA is 
still doing step 3. I don't really care how. :-)

They're invoked when the code runs.

If it helps, consider that the following:

 db.transaction(function(tx) {
   tx.executeSql('query 1', null, function(tx, rs) {
     tx.executeSql('query 2', null, function(tx, rs) {
     });
   });
   tx.executeSql('query 3', null, function(tx, rs) {
   });
 });

...is equivalent to:

 function q(tx, rs) {
   tx.executeSql('query 2', null);
 }

 function t(tx) {
   tx.executeSql('query 1', null, q);
   tx.executeSql('query 3', null);
 }

 db.transaction(t);

Here you see the execution order more obviously.


&gt;<i> 4.11.2:

</I>&gt;<i> the transaction steps are run? In this case, I also see execution order
</I>&gt;<i> 1,3,2.

The transaction steps are what call the callback that contains the calls 
to executeSql().

Right now it has three callbacks, and the third is the generic success 
one, which I assume all users will always want to hook into (otherwise, 
what are they doing?). So adding more variants seems pointless. I haven't 
changed this.

I think we should get implementation experience here and update the spec

Assuming you mean the display name and expected size (this was clarified

that UAs can ignore them. However, it makes no sense to make them optional 
to the author, since the UAs that _do_ use them will need them always
