</I>
The spec currently doesn't say. I've added an issue marker regarding this, 
but basically the rendering section will define this, based on 
implementation experience.

No, the user agent is expected to provide its own controls, and not expose 
the embedding framework's controls.


&gt;<i> If that's the case, is the expectation that authors will need to 
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily hide controls (or make sure they're already hidden) before

</I>
The videoHeight attribute can be used to determine the actual native 
height of the video content.


I have omitted a great deal of the remainder of this specification as it 
did not contain actionable feedback on the specification as far as I could 
tell. Please let me know if I missed something.

</I>
&lt;video&gt; would be appropriate for embedding the FLV files used by Flash 
players, but to embed the SWF files, the &lt;embed&gt; element is better suited.

</I>
Correct, except that it's &quot;at least one format&quot;, not &quot;exactly one format&quot;.

I don't really understand what that would look like. It isn't what &lt;video&gt; 
is currently intended to be, though.

</I>
Yes, the WebKit implementation (Safari implementation) of &lt;video&gt; will 
allow people to provide new codecs to handle new formats.


&gt;<i> Here's a precise scenario:  A user creates an HTML5 page, and of course

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Will Safari provide an API that allows Microsoft to support this 
</I>&gt;<i> scenario [...]
</I>
Yes, the Windows Safari browser would just use DirectShow to render the 
videos, and DirectShow allows Microsoft to register a new codec to handle 
the Windows Media content.

Since we're introducing &lt;video&gt;, I don't see much reason to go out of our 
way and support video in &lt;object&gt; as well. It would just make things even 
more complicated.


&gt;<i> Also |type=&quot;image&quot;| (or 'video') should be enough, without slash and 
</I>&gt;<i> subtype, but I've raised that before.
</I>
I imagine I'll get to that feedback when I process the &lt;object&gt; element 
feedback then. :-)

The QuickTime framework can register itself as a codec in DirectShow, 
which would then work in IE.
