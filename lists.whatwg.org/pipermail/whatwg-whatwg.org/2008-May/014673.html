I don't intend target=&quot;_reference&quot; for notifications; that would be 
quite inappropriate. Firstly, a notification should appear unbidden, 
but if an author tried to use target=&quot;_reference&quot; in that way, the 
popup blockers in legacy browsers would ensure it never appeared. 
Secondly, a notification is typically something you read once and then 
ignore, so it doesn't matter if it scrolls out of view, while part of 
the point of target=&quot;_reference&quot; is to ensure the resource *doesn't* 
scroll out of view. And thirdly, it usually makes little sense for a 
notification to have a separate URL, but this is much more useful for 
help, terms of service, privacy policies etc.

I intend target=&quot;_reference&quot; for the purposes I actually described: 
help, terms of service, privacy policies, and (eventually) footnotes 
and endnotes. I chose &quot;_reference&quot; because that term roughly covers all 
those use cases. But if the name is confusing, which it may be, I'd be 
happy for it to be &quot;_secondary&quot; or something similarly non-specific.

&gt;<i> How are you supposed to figure out the size of this thing? If it's

</I>&gt;<i> once..
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
target=&quot;_reference&quot; would be inappropriate for presenting errors, for 
much the same reasons as it would be inappropriate for presenting 
notifications.

The exact presentation is up to the UA, of course, but I imagine a 
resizable pane at the bottom of the viewport, defaulting to about a 
quarter of the viewport height or about 12 em, whichever is smaller. 
(Ideally it would be sized based on the actual height of the linked 
resource, but that's impractical: impractical for internal fragments 
because you usually can't tell where the fragment ends, and impractical 
for external resources because -- just as with target=&quot;_blank&quot; -- 
responsiveness would require showing the pane before the resource 
finishes loading.)

Cheers
