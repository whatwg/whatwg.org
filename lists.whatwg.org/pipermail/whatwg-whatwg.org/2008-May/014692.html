Summary: profile=&quot;&quot; doesn't work in practice so we have dropped it. We 
haven't replaced it with anything since there isn't really a problem to 
solve -- conflicts don't occur in practice, as Microformat names are 
picked to be rather unique and recognisable. The market takes care of 
problems like this without the need for namespace syntax.

</I>
This is resolved these days by the simple solution of not picking 
conflicting names. It seems to work pretty well in practice.

I don't really understand how this would work with HTTP authentication. 
Can you elaborate?

Sure, but you know about both, and have control over your format.

Yup.


&gt;<i> &gt; In the market place, out in the &quot;real world&quot;, conflicts will be

</I>&gt;<i> That is an idealistic view which is plain false because you can get two

</I>&gt;<i> don't have enough influence with either company to get them to change, 
</I>&gt;<i> so they get screwed (all because Ian' thinks this isn't a real world

</I>
Well, in the 4 years we've been doing this HTML5 thing, this hasn't 
happened. I don't see why it would happen.


&gt;<i> Maybe the problem is you work for Google, who can dictate, and not for 
</I>&gt;<i> small companies that get dictated too, so you don't see the problem.
</I>
I've worked for small companies too. In fact, when this part of the spec 
was last edited, I worked for Opera.

As far as I can tell, you just basically described how Microformat specs 
work.

Indeed.

If someone wants to have a widely used standard, it has to be registered 
in the public consciousness somehow, yes.


&gt;<i> I'm not arguing that everyone would need to change hCard on their

</I>&gt;<i> documents do not become non-conformant the day a new extension is added.
</I>
HTML4 required profile=&quot;&quot; for this kind of thing, as did Microformats, and 
few people bothered. I don't see why we would continue down this obviously 
failed path.


&gt;<i> I'd like to add that the same problem can exists in reverse too: there

</I>&gt;<i> of software or by other means, carelessly popularize a class also in use 
</I>&gt;<i> by a microformat. This would make the microformat unusable on the web. 
</I>&gt;<i> The more microformats there are, the bigger are the risks that this 
</I>&gt;<i> happen.
</I>
If it happens, one or the other is adapted, and things can go merrilly on 
their way. No need for anything complicated like profile=&quot;&quot;.
