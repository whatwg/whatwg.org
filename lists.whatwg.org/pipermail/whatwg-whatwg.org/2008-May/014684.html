This is all moot now with &lt;dialog&gt;, as far as I can tell.

&lt;dialog&gt; with classes for more fine grained styling should be adequate.

Indeed.


&gt;<i> [1] Note &quot;Content inside a q element must be quoted from another source&quot;,

</I>
The spec now has &lt;dialog&gt; with &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;.


&gt;<i> For instance, this is a dialog, but since its mixed with the main text you
</I>&gt;<i> can't surround it by &lt;dialog&gt;. Also, using &lt;cite&gt; in here isn't very
</I>&gt;<i> practical, as the text refers to the speakers as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; most of the
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;He was downstair when he heard a strange noise from outside. When he
</I>&gt;<i>     went to see, he saw Julietta in the park screaming at him: &lt;q&gt;Where were
</I>&gt;<i>     you?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was busy fixing the pipes. What happened here?&lt;/q&gt; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;There was a cat on the tree&lt;/q&gt;, she said. &lt;q&gt;It jumped and landed
</I>&gt;<i>     in here.&lt;/q&gt; She was pointing at a crate full of pieces of metal. &lt;q&gt;I
</I>&gt;<i>     jumped!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Why you need &lt;q&gt; markup here I don't know. Just use quote marks...


&gt;<i> It's interesting to note however that the same text could be surrounded by
</I>&gt;<i> dialog tags when formatting the same dialog in French. In the following
</I>&gt;<i> example, &lt;q&gt; must be styled with no marks and add em dashes must be added at
</I>&gt;<i> the start of each paragraph in the dialog (this could be done by CSS, although
</I>&gt;<i> here I've done it in the source for clarity):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Il &#233;tait au sous-sol quand il entendit un bruit &#233;trange venant de
</I>&gt;<i>     dehors.
</I>&gt;<i>     Quand il est alla voir ce qui se passait, il vit Julietta dans le park qui
</I>&gt;<i>     lui cria:&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&#151; &lt;q&gt;O&#249; &#233;tais-tu ?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&#151; &lt;q&gt;J'&#233;tait occup&#233; &#224; r&#233;parer les tuyaux. Qu'est-ce qui c'est pass&#233;
</I>&gt;<i>     ici ?&lt;/q&gt; a-t-il demand&#233;.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&#151; &lt;q&gt;Il y avait un chat dans l'arbre&lt;/q&gt;, dit-elle. &lt;q&gt;Il a saut&#233;
</I>&gt;<i>     pour atterrir juste l&#224;.&lt;/q&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Elle pointant une caisse pleine de morceaux de m&#233;tal.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&#151; &lt;q&gt;Et j'ai fait le saut !&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that without &lt;q&gt; in the previous example, there is no easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish inserted text like &quot;dit-elle&quot; (&quot;she said&quot;), these are typically
</I>&gt;<i> disambiguated from context in French. But I'd consider the &lt;q&gt; element
</I>&gt;<i> optional anyway, even if omitting it leaves this ambiguity. The reason being
</I>&gt;<i> that there is no way to disambiguate inserted text inside inline quotations
</I>&gt;<i> either. What I did in the previous dialog requires the removal of the quote
</I>&gt;<i> characters in the styling of &lt;q&gt;, but to be consistent you'd need to do that
</I>&gt;<i> with inline quotations too, which goes against both the recommended usage and
</I>&gt;<i> the default stylesheet for &lt;q&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &#171; &lt;q&gt;Pourquoi se d&#233;placer ?&lt;/q&gt; dit-elle. &lt;q&gt;On a pas besoin de vous&lt;/q&gt; &#187;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think this is how &lt;q&gt; should have worked from the start, but it
</I>&gt;<i> may be too late to change that. Anyway, let's return to the subject of
</I>&gt;<i> dialogs.
</I>
I don't see the need for any markup for these examples.


&gt;<i> The second type of dialog I considered is more like in a theatrical piece,
</I>&gt;<i> where dialogs are completely free of any other prose. It was previously
</I>&gt;<i> suggested in HTML4 to use &lt;dl&gt; for this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Mary and Mark begin walking in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dt&gt;Mary&lt;/dt&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dd&gt;So where do you want to go tomorrow? I can tell you already
</I>&gt;<i>         have something in mind.&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dt&gt;Mark&lt;/dt&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dd&gt;What makes you think that?&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it'd be better expressed this way:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;Mary and Mark begin walking in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mary:&lt;/cite&gt; So where do you want to go tomorrow? I can tell
</I>&gt;<i>        you already have something in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark:&lt;/cite&gt; What makes you think that?&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here, &lt;q&gt; tags would be optional because the dialog element already implies
</I>&gt;<i> that everything in the paragraphs is part of the dialog. And since &lt;q&gt; adds
</I>&gt;<i> quotes, which are not desired in this case, it'd probably be a bad idea to add
</I>&gt;<i> it anyway.
</I>
The &lt;dialog&gt; element in the spec now takes the best of both of the above 
proposals.

The main reason for &lt;dialog&gt; is to resolve the evergreen debate about what

Paragraphs can just be included outside the &lt;dialog&gt; (close out the dialog 
and reopen it). And we've handled &lt;time&gt; now. But I'm not sure how to 
handle the annotations and actions.

Anything but &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt; is going to cause us headaches in the parser.

With the parentheses inside the &lt;time&gt;, but yes, that's what the spec has 
now.

That page doesn't look like it would use &lt;dialog&gt; to me. More just use of 
&lt;p&gt; and &lt;q&gt; and/or &lt;blockquote&gt;.

A conversation isn't an ordered list, and a fictional text isn't a quote.

I don't understand why closing the dialog and reopening it is so bad.


&gt;<i> As an example:

I don't see why we would need those elements. You can already do the above 
without them.

Using &lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; has the advantage of working today.

&lt;dl&gt; really doesn't work well for dialogue -- it's not name-value pairs if 
the same speaker speaks several times.

I don't think &lt;conversation&gt; or &lt;transcript&gt; or &lt;discussion&gt; are better 
than &lt;dialog&gt;. I agree that &quot;dialog&quot; is a suboptimal name, though.
