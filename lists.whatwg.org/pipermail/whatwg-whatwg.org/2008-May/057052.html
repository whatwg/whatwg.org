I dunno, some kind of iterative algorithm that you want to visualize  
at random timesteps.  You could keep the output in a separate array  
and copy over when you want to render it.

</I>
Yep, that's true.

&gt;<i> I think we need a list of use cases for ImageData, off the top of my

</I>&gt;<i> * filters -- in general a single write per pixel, potentially

</I>&gt;<i> * Generated images -- still arguably single write per pixel

</I>
Yeah, those are all good use cases -- it just seems like requiring  
immediate clamping is basically specifying for a specific  
implementation, when the overall goal is &quot;checking for invalid data&quot;.   
Specifying that the error should come from putImageData would give  
implementations more flexibility, without limiting error checking.   
(You could argue that it's easier to get a precise error location by  
checking on pixel assignment, but I don't think that the potential  
cost and loss of flexibility is worth it.  Once authors know that they  
have an error in their data, they can take other action to track it  
down.)
