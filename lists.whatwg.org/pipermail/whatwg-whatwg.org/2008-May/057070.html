</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That [&lt;talk&gt; is] probably the best suggestion so far, but I'm still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not convinced it's really much better than &lt;dialog&gt; . I think it has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least as many other interpretations (e.g. what we call a &quot;talk&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over here is really a slide show).
</I>
Indeed; as a noun a &quot;talk&quot; seems to refer to a presentation more often
than the action of talking.  &lt;talking&gt; would be less subject to
misinterpretation, but the gerund form makes an awkward tag name.

&gt;<i> food for thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;conversation&gt; (probably too long)
</I>
It's more specific than 'dialogue', which might incorrectly suggest it
isn't appropriate to use it for dialogue that isn't a conversation.

&gt;<i> * &lt;colloquy&gt; 
</I>
Ditto, but also it's a less-well-known word and harder to spell!

&gt;<i> * &lt;chat&gt;      (probably too IRC, messenger oriented, though here
</I>&gt;<i>                I suspect my own distortion field. People often says
</I>&gt;<i>                &quot;let's have a chat&quot;.)
</I>
People do say that.  But this element would also be the one used for
marking up Shakespeare's plays, and labelling them as &quot;chats&quot; seems a
touch barbaric.

&gt;<i> * &lt;dialogue&gt;  (was wondering if it was less geeky than dialog, not sure)
</I>
I think so, but that's because probably I'm from the UK where &quot;dialog&quot;
is a spelling mistake in general use, so only occurs in narrow technical
contexts.  Elsewhere HTML takes USA spellings (&quot;color&quot;, etc), so it
would be bad to pick &quot;dialogue&quot; if most USA speakers would naturally
spell it &quot;dialog&quot;.

(Though having either of them is likely to lead _some_ group to
accidentally using t'other spelling.)

&gt;<i> * &lt;discourse&gt; 
</I>
Too obscure/specific.

&gt;<i> * &lt;speech&gt; 
</I>
I quite like that.  It could be misinterpreted as &quot;a speech&quot; rather than
&quot;some speech&quot;, but it may be the least-bad.

&gt;<i> * &lt;converse&gt; 
</I>
More commonly it's a verb than a noun, which makes it awkward.
