<PRE>(This is only partially on-topic, so apologies in advance.)

&gt;<i> I would like to have a look at a convincing example supporting
</I>&gt;<i> your argument...
</I>
The best examples are no longer on the internet, since Apple long ago
stopped advancing or evangelizing this capability of QuickTime.

Two references I can point you do are Inside QuickTime: Interactive
Movies[1], and the book Interactive QuickTime: Authoring Wired Media[2].

&gt;<i> ...that rationalized your demand that the video element should
</I>&gt;<i> support arbitrary virtual machines, including Adobe Flash.
</I>
Any multimedia-centric runtime conceived or actively advanced during in the
1990s supports the kind of functionality you're talking about, which is why
it doesn't make sense to put Flash into a different box.

That's all kind of besides the main point, which is that it's a missed
opportunity that &lt;video&gt; will only support one format across browsers/OSs.

I'm okay with that, since this problem can be solved outside of HTML 5.

I replied as soon as I was able to review your example.  You argued that a
QuickTime movie can be used to make the host computer execute arbitrary
algorithms and that rationalized your demand that the video element should
support arbitrary virtual machines, including Adobe Flash.  I would like to
have a look at a convincing example supporting your argument; the one you
provided is not satisfactory because it is a mere redirection.

Yours sincerely
Chris

Not sure why you're responding to a 3-month-old email or what &quot;Turing
complete&quot; has to do with anything (the QuickTime runtime is also Turing
complete), but feel free to ping me off-list if you have questions.
