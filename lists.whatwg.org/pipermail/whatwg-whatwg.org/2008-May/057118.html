I'm not sure adding states is all that safe. Any code that does a  
switch on the state would now fall through to an untested code path.

&gt;<i> It isn't difficult to imagine all kinds of additional playback  
</I>&gt;<i> states. For example, what if there was great demand for forward- 
</I>&gt;<i> seeking and backward-seeking states? (e.g. the states that are  
</I>&gt;<i> usually associated with those &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; buttons) How could those  
</I>&gt;<i> states be added?
</I>
Then you would treat the video as playing, and the playback rate as  
different than 1.0.

&gt;<i> The media error state is also inconsistent, and this time for no  
</I>&gt;<i> apparent reason, although it would at least be easy to update. A  
</I>&gt;<i> more consistent design would be to have an &quot;errorState&quot; attribute  
</I>&gt;<i> that is one of:
</I>&gt;<i> NO_ERROR, ABORTED, NETWORK_ERROR, DECODING_ERROR
</I>
The type of error is not a state. There is no state transition that  
will move you from one to the other. An error is something that  
happened. There could however be a type of error that you reached.

</I>&gt;<i> And why are the error state names prefixed with &quot;MEDIA_ERR&quot; when the  
</I>&gt;<i> names for the other states are not prefixed? e.g. LOADING instead of  
</I>&gt;<i> MEDIA_NET_LOADING.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If NO_ERROR was given a value of 0, testing for an error with this

</I>&gt;<i> We have that -- the &quot;paused&quot; attribute. When it's true, show play, and
</I>&gt;<i> when it's paused, show false. You don't want to show play when the

</I>&gt;<i> you aren't playing is that you're buffered or seeking for instance.  
</I>&gt;<i> The
