</I>
I'd rather not preclude that people implement support for it, I just don't 
want such support to be required. Sometimes we get lucky and things like 
this take off, at which point I'd be more than happy to require it. :-)


&gt;<i> In general I agree that attributes are not a scarce resource, but if you 
</I>&gt;<i> need to add use-specific attributes to a supposedly-generic element I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that indicates that the generic element is inappropriate for the 
</I>&gt;<i> use-case.
</I>
I disagree. Look at &lt;input&gt;, for instance.


&gt;<i> I don't know what link rel type uses &quot;disabled&quot;, but I would have had 
</I>&gt;<i> the same objection to that.
</I>
rel=stylesheet.


&gt;<i> If the meaning of &quot;title&quot; is something different for stylesheets than 
</I>&gt;<i> for other link rel types then that was an inappropriate use of that 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute as well. It's too late to change it now, but that's no reason 
</I>&gt;<i> to continue overloading generic elements/attributes with special cases.
</I>
I don't think the overloading in this case is a big deal. It's not like 
&lt;object&gt;, it's not even as bad as &lt;input&gt;.


&gt;<i> link is also interesting in that unlike &lt;input type=&quot;...&quot;&gt; rel can 
</I>&gt;<i> contain several values. Is it conforming to use [sizes] on a link 
</I>&gt;<i> element that contains both &quot;icon&quot; and a another, non-icon keyword?
</I>
Sure.


&gt;<i> What about &lt;a rel=&quot;icon&quot; ... width=&quot;...&quot; height=&quot;...&quot;&gt; ?
</I>
rel=icon doesn't apply to &lt;a href&gt;.


&gt;<i> Finally, what is the process for contributors to the RelExtensions page 
</I>&gt;<i> to include extension attributes?
</I>
They can't.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/gif; width=24, height=24&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This doesn't really work because we would need to add parameters to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; types we might not yet know. It also results in potentially 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated parsing rules, which I don't think people would get right. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (See the comments I made for media queries.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably this would be defined (if at all) for everything under 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;image/&quot;, just as &quot;charset&quot; is defined for everything under &quot;text/&quot;. (In 
</I>&gt;<i> theory, at least.)
</I>
Getting the relevant RFCs changed would likely be non-trivial. (Though we 
should probably look into it, actually, to fix text/*.)

</I>&gt;<i> Does this disallow composing .ico files from multiple separate files?

</I>
Sure, the OS just becomes part of the UA in that case. The effect is the 
same.


&gt;<i> Also this algorithm doesn't match current browser behaviour, is this
</I>&gt;<i> intentional?
</I>&gt;<i> I did a quick test with a bunch of random favicons:
</I>&gt;<i> * Opera 9.5b2 loads all icons (that's pretty bad if one decides to provide
</I>&gt;<i> Leopard's monsterous 300KB icons) and displays last icon loaded,
</I>&gt;<i> * Firefox 3b5 picks last icon regardless of attributes. It loads all icons
</I>&gt;<i> when I reload page after restoring session.
</I>&gt;<i> * WebKit nightly and Fluid pick last icon that has type attribute (even if
</I>&gt;<i> type is bogus), or just last if none have type.
</I>
I've changed the spec to say to use the last one specified in case of 
ties.


&gt;<i> I'm afraid that this could cause trouble (every visitor downloading icon 
</I>&gt;<i> that's 20&#8211;300 times larger than typical favicon). Why not use 
</I>&gt;<i> rel=application-icon or rel=appicon?
</I>
I don't understand the question.


&gt;<i> I don't like the &quot;any&quot; keyword. SVG icons are scallable, but it's not 
</I>&gt;<i> the same as being usable at any size. For example Tango icons project 
</I>&gt;<i> provides PNG for 16, 22 and 32px icons in addition to SVG, because lines 
</I>&gt;<i> and finer details in SVG become illegible at small sizes.
</I>
The spec allows the UA to make that distinction.


&gt;<i> Does the specified size imply that UA is required to display icon at 
</I>&gt;<i> given size only? (i.e. is &quot;any&quot; obligatory to have icon scaled at all?)
</I>
The spec doesn't say what the UA is to do with the icon.


&gt;<i> What if sizes attribute is absent?
</I>
I've clarfieid this case.

</I>&gt;<i> No matter what the spec says, I think we can all agree that once this

</I>
I've added a requirement in the spec that if an icon is found unsuitable, 
the next one must be tried.

HTML5 defines handling of developer mistakes. :-)

As the spec is defined, it's left up to the UA to decide whether or not an 
icon is &quot;appropriate&quot;, so yes, what you suggest is allowed.
