I think this is like async-versus-sync.  It's very important to allow
people to do things the right way, and it's very nice to make it easy
to do things the right way, but you shouldn't force people into a
particular approach unless that approach is pretty unassailable, or
the alternative is simply worse.  I can't see any way to buffer result
sets until the end of the transaction without losing a fair bit of
generality (because the API can't make assumptions, so would have to
just buffer everything).

I think the only way you can really make it better is to put something
like an executeSql() function directly on Database objects, which
could shift the success callback entirely outside the transaction
scope.  I think that would reasonably match server-side SQL use (you
either send a bare SELECT with implicit transaction, or use explicit
BEGIN/END to group things which must be consistent).
