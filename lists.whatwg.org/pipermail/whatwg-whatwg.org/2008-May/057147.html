Summary:

 * I've added a sandbox=&quot;&quot; attribute to &lt;iframe&gt;, which by default
   disables a number of features and takes a space-separated list of
   features to re-enable:

     - by default, content in sandboxed browsing contexts, and any
       browsing contexts nested in them, have a unique origin
       (independent of the origin of their URI); this can be overriden
       using the &quot;allow-same-origin&quot; keyword

     - by default, all form controls in those browsing contexts are
       disabled; this can be overriden using the &quot;allow-forms&quot;
       keyword

     - by default, script in those browsing contexts cannot run; this can
       be overriden using the &quot;allow-scripts&quot; keyword

     - content in those browsing contexts cannot navigate other
       browsing contexts outside of the sandbox (seamless=&quot;&quot; below
       overrides this)

     - content in those browsing contexts cannot create new browsing
       contexts or open modal dialogs or alerts

     - all plugins in those browsing contexts are disabled

 * I've added a seamless=&quot;&quot; boolean attribute to &lt;iframe&gt;, which, if
   the content's active document's URI has the same origin as the
   container, causes the iframe to size vertically to the bounding box
   of the contents, and horizontally to the width of the container,
   and which causes the initial containing block of the contents to be
   treated as zero height. In addition, styles on the root element of
   the content must inherit from the &lt;iframe&gt; instead of being the
   initial values, and the style sheets that apply to the &lt;iframe&gt;
   must also apply to the contents. In addition, any time the browsing
   context navigates itself, the parent browsing context gets
   navigated instead.

This is all HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. I am looking for feedback on the general 
approaches taken.

There are various things that this doesn't address yet; e.g. there's no 
way to force (or even allow) a non-seamless iframe to open links in the 
parent window.

</I>&gt;<i> With HTML 5 parsing spec, there will be one single algorithm for parsing 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML code with well-defined error recovery. So, the HTML cleaner at the 
</I>&gt;<i> server side runs the HTML 5 parser on the user-supplied text, which

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &lt;/sandbox&gt; tag is ignored as an easy parse error because there is no

</I>&gt;<i> * Welcome to my blog!
</I>&gt;<i> * A
</I>&gt;<i>     href=&quot;#&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     safe-onclick=&quot;alert(document.cookie)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   * Click here
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the final stage, the HTML cleaner re-serializes the DOM into the 
</I>&gt;<i> following code, which is saved into the database:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome to my blog!&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> safe-onclick=&quot;alert(document.cookie)&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the site renders the blog page, it puts the &quot;HTML for page top&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> inside a sandbox:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;sandbox&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome to my blog!&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; safe-onclick=&quot;alert(document.cookie)&quot;&gt;Click
</I>&gt;<i> here&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/sandbox&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each blog entry is probably also contained in its own sandbox. This is 
</I>&gt;<i> even more important on the so-called friends pages, where entries by 
</I>&gt;<i> different authors are displayed on the same page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the page is rendered in a modern user agent which supports 
</I>&gt;<i> sandboxing, the safe-onclick attribute is interpreted exactly the same 
</I>&gt;<i> as onclick. When the user clicks the link, the event handler is

</I>&gt;<i> document object, so it doesn't retrieve the cookies (I think 
</I>&gt;<i> document.cookie should just return an empty string). The visitor's 
</I>&gt;<i> session cookies are safe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the page is rendered in an older user agent which doesn't support

</I>&gt;<i> When the user clicks the link, no event handler is executed, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> cookies are safe again.
</I>
You can do this now (though it's far uglier) by taking the author's markup 
and converting it to base64, and then stuffing it into an iframe something 
like this:

   &lt;iframe seamless sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-forms&quot;
           src=&quot;data:text/html;base64,PCFET0NUWVBFIEhUTUw%2BPHRpdGxlPjwvdGl0bGU%2BV2VsY29tZSB0byBteSBibG9nITwvc2FuZGJveD48YSBocmVmPSIjIiBvbmNsaWNrPSJhbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpIj5DbGljayBoZXJlPC9hPg0K&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/iframe&gt;

This isn't very readable, I'll grant you. I'm thinking of introducing a 
new attribute. I haven't worked out what to call it yet, but definitely 
not &quot;src&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, &quot;src2&quot;, &quot;content&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, or &quot;data&quot; -- maybe 
&quot;html&quot; or &quot;doc&quot;, though neither of those are great. This attribute would 
take a string which would then be interpreted as the source document 
markup of an HTML document, much like the above; it would override src=&quot;&quot; 
if it was present, allowing src=&quot;&quot; to be used for legacy UAs:

   &lt;iframe seamless sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-forms&quot; doc=&quot;
     &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
     Welcome to my blog!
     &lt;/sandbox&gt;
     &lt;a href='#' onclick='alert(document.cookie)'&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;
   &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

(There are things we can do to make this better, e.g. make the &lt;!DOCTYPE 
HMTL&gt; and &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; bits implicit, maybe introducing type=&quot;&quot; to say 
whether it's HTML or XML instead of only supporting HTML, maybe saying 
that if src=&quot;&quot; and doc=&quot;&quot; are both specified they must have identical 
data, etc.)

Comments and suggestions on this are welcome. I haven't added it to the 
spec yet. I do agree that without this or something equivalent that we 
don't have a solution for sandboxing embedded blog comments yet.

I've basically added this to &lt;iframe&gt; using the seamless=&quot;&quot; attribute.


&gt;<i> Should the stylesheets of the outer or the inner document be used?

I went with &quot;yes&quot;.


&gt;<i> When a fragment identifier is specified, should we render that element,

I went with making that work the same as with normal &lt;iframe&gt;s (so likely 
no effect if the default shrink-wrapping-to-boundary-box behaviour is in 
effect).


&gt;<i> Should style be inherited from the parent of the &lt;include&gt;, or from the

I've made inheritance happen from &lt;iframe&gt; to root element.


&gt;<i> Should the inner DOM be rendered inside of, or in place of the &lt;include&gt;?
</I>
I've made this happen as with &lt;iframe&gt;.

Woah. That's far more radical. I have no idea how to do that. How would 
you make the parser not generate the implied elements and switch straight 
to the &quot;in table&quot; mode? How would you make the CSS model work with this? 
How would you define conformance for the document fragments?

The sandbox=&quot;&quot; attribute can be specified to change it from the former to 
the latter (and in fact, from the former to an isolated origin regardless 
of the true origin of the document).

It may be worth bringing this up with the CSSWG if it really is just a 
rendering issue.

That's pretty much what seamless=&quot;&quot; does, yes.

That seems overly complicated, but the spec says something similar in

Adding sandbox=&quot;&quot; solves this (at least for new UAs).

Degrade securely _and usefully_, or just securely (and maybe to nothing)?

The latter is handled by the doc=&quot;&quot; proposal. The former may be impossible

While simple, this wouldn't let you do things like have trusted content

In some cases the sandbox would be &quot;defence in depth&quot; -- for example, in 
all cases where user-generated content is embedded today.


&gt;<i> The key differences from &lt;iframe&gt; are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Doesn't require loading of a separate document via a separate HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> request, and without the ugliness of data: URIs. If there was some 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;inline&quot; version of &lt;iframe&gt;, such as &lt;iframe&gt;content&lt;/iframe&gt;, that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be just fine.
</I>
doc=&quot;&quot; would handle this, then...


&gt;<i> 2. Implements the security barrier even though the inner content doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> come from a different domain. &lt;iframe&gt; would require a separate domain 
</I>&gt;<i> for that.
</I>
sandbox=&quot;&quot; does this now.


&gt;<i> 3. The security barrier is asymmetric, i.e. the outer scripts have 
</I>&gt;<i> access to the inner content, but not the other way round.
</I>
What's the use case for this?


&gt;<i> All attempts to treat user-submitted HTML as a string are doomed to 
</I>&gt;<i> having such vulnerabilities. &lt;sandbox&gt; alone doesn't add much to this 
</I>&gt;<i> problem. Just look at how complex is the HTML sanitizer in LiveJournal 
</I>&gt;<i> which allows some user-submitted markup but not all.
</I>
That's one advantage of the doc=&quot;&quot; idea; it makes sanitising mostly 
trivial compared to all other ideas for this.

This relies on the author being able to reliably produce unpredictable 
content, which is a very dubious responsibility to put on many authors.

Also, it would make the XML guys have a fit. Then again, maybe that goes 
in the &quot;pro&quot; column and not the &quot;con&quot; column...

It's not enirely clear what the proposal here is; as far as I can tell 
it's an HTTP header. Is that right? Self-describing the security 
restrictions on content works for same-site serving, but not really for 
third-party content.


&gt;<i> IE has the proprietary &quot;security&quot; attribute on &lt;iframe&gt; which restricts

I tried using this, but it was tied too closely to IE's own security 
concepts to really make use of it, sadly.

I've added height/width back.
