<PRE>Numerals are written RTL in Arabic script, little-endian.  
For example, if you want to write &quot;twelve thousand three hundred and fourty-five&quot;, you start from 5 and follow up to 1.
It was easier than to start from 1____ and replace the blanks with subunits.
On the other hand, Latin script is LTR with numbers written RTL (unless Roman numerals are used, of course).
This feels kinda uncomfortable, hard to write and hard to read &#8212; but European accountants have had six centuries to get used to that.  As a result, both the ordering and the direction were reversed, resulting in LTR BE used today.
(Note: numerological Hebrew numerals are RTL BE; 
this system is mirrored in the Platonic Greek numbering scheme, 
which is LTR BE.)

Vulgar fraction characters are&#8230; er&#8230; vulgar?  I do not think the specification should endorse using them.

Did you learn anything relevant to this discussion from that weekend? (Or 
any other weekend. :-) )


&gt;<i> And how about &quot;vulgar fraction characters&quot; like &#188; (U+00BC VULGAR 
</I>&gt;<i> FRACTION ONE QUARTER) and other numeric characters from the &#65296;(U+FF10 
</I>&gt;<i> FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO) to&#65305;(U+FF19 FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE) or &#8544; (U+2160 
</I>&gt;<i> ROMAN NUMERAL ONE) to &#8578; (U+2182 ROMAN NUMERAL TEN THOUSAND) ranges?
</I>
What about them?
