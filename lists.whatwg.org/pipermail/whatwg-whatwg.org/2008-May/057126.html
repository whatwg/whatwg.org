<PRE>&gt;<i> My instinct is that if the community decides it is &quot;just kind of  
</I>&gt;<i> weird&quot;, then it is a useful shorthand that we wouldn't lose anything  
</I>&gt;<i> from standardizing on.
</I>
It is *very* weird, and therefore not a &quot;useful shorthand.&quot;

In JavaScript, &quot;delete&quot; means &quot;remove this property / interface from  
this JavaScript object.&quot; I can't think of any context in which it  
means anything else.

For example, &quot;delete node.parentNode&quot; attempts to remove the  
&quot;parentNode&quot; property from &quot;node&quot;. It does not remove &quot;parentNode&quot;  
from the document or anything like that.

&quot;delete window&quot; attempts to remove the &quot;window&quot; property from the  
global object. It does not close the window or anything like that.

In other words, you can be certain that &quot;delete&quot; is a simple operation  
with a consistent side-effect.

As a JavaScript programmer, I would find it very difficult to reason  
about objects that might or might not change the behavior of the  
&quot;delete&quot; operator. One reason i would find it very difficult is that  
operator overloading does not exist in JavaScript at all, so to  
understand this one API, I would need to understand a vast corpus of  
programming language goobery that is not at all covered in any  
JavaScript manual. Another reason I would find it very difficult is  
that the overloaded meaning of &quot;delete&quot; here (&quot;remove persistent  
storage from disk&quot;) is far afield from the original meaning (&quot;remove  
interface from temporary object in memory&quot;). To give you an analogy,  
even in C++, where you're allowed to overload operator delete, if you  
overloaded operator delete to mean &quot;do not free this object's memory,  
but do delete the file it references from the file system&quot;, well,  
let's just say that your patch would not pass code review with any of  
your four reviewers :).

I am not sure if any JS decoration or collection libraries depend on  
the canonical behavior of operator delete, but if they do, I would  
hate for them all to have to ship with the asterisk, &quot;BEWARE: do NOT  
use this decoration / collection library with that one weird DOM  
object that interprets 'delete' to mean 'remove important data from  
the user's disk'&quot;. Oy!
