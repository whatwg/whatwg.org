</I>
The spec now defines this.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no data attribute, the resource can not load or the

</I>&gt;<i> contents.
</I>
The above is somewhat what the spec says, though it is more closely 
aligned with what browsers (Mozilla in particular in this case) seem to 
do.


&gt;<i> Issues: if there is a known content-type and a data: attribute, 
</I>&gt;<i> should the UA check if the content-type sent from server also 
</I>&gt;<i> identifies the plugin? In other words, do we want to say that the 
</I>&gt;<i> type attribute on the OBJECT tag is only a hint and that the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP content-type header is the one that counts?
</I>
Right now the spec uses the Content-Type header if it is present.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure if &quot;only a hint&quot; should be speced. It sounds quite risky to 
</I>&gt;<i> meddle with the logic for embedding contents - could break many sites, 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly if we are supposed to start relying on the famously 
</I>&gt;<i> malconfigured HTTP content-type responses.
</I>
What should it be instead?


&gt;<i> Since there are use cases for plugins that do not load data at all, the 
</I>&gt;<i> UA should initialise the plugin even without data attribute if the type 
</I>&gt;<i> is known. That sort of negates the point about type being a hint because 
</I>&gt;<i> we can't initialise one plugin, look at the content-type of files that 
</I>&gt;<i> plugin decides to request and say &quot;whops, we started the wrong plugin, 
</I>&gt;<i> let's do this again&quot;. If the spec goes the &quot;hint&quot; route, it really needs 
</I>&gt;<i> to make that apply only to OBJECTs with a data attribute, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> minimise problems with malconfigured servers it should only take place 
</I>&gt;<i> if the UA doesn't know the specified type attribute IMO.
</I>
Right now if type=&quot;&quot; is present but data=&quot;&quot; isn't then the respective 
plugin is fired, otherwise the plugin to fire is taken from the 
Content-Type header.


&gt;<i> Another issue is of course if and how one should map classid to plugins.
</I>
Indeed. I don't know how to do that. I suppose it is UA-specific.

</I>
For the no-data=&quot;&quot; case, the spec now handles it.


&gt;<i> There also needs to be some specifics for the classid attribute.  If the

</I>
It appears it should fail. Do browsers do otherwise?


&gt;<i> How should data uris be handled?  Is it just up to the plug-in to handle 
</I>&gt;<i> the passed data uri or is the UA allowed to create a file from the data 
</I>&gt;<i> URI and pass the file path to the plug-in/hander (if it can do it 
</I>&gt;<i> safely)?
</I>
Isn't this up to the plugin API?


&gt;<i> What should happen when a UA encounters a codebase attribute that has a 
</I>&gt;<i> path to a cab file instead of a base URI? Should the UA always use the 
</I>&gt;<i> codebase to resolve URIs even if it has junk in it?
</I>
Right now codebase=&quot;&quot; is just ignored by the spec. What should it do?


&gt;<i> First, the UA should check for a classid attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If present and the the UA has a handler associated with the specified 
</I>&gt;<i> naming scheme, then the UA should pass all arguments to the handler in a 
</I>&gt;<i> manner that is specific to the handler.
</I>
That's what the spec says, indeed.


&gt;<i> If the classid attribute is not present or the naming scheme is not
</I>&gt;<i> supported or the handler returns an error code, then the UA must check
</I>&gt;<i> for the presence of a type attribute.
</I>
If classid=&quot;&quot; isn't supported, it just shows fallback.


&gt;<i> If it exists, the UA must check to see if it has a handler associated
</I>&gt;<i> with the Content-Type specified in the type attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the Content-Type is associated with a handler, the UA must pass all
</I>&gt;<i> arguments to the handler.
</I>
The resource is actually downloaded by the UA in this case, as far as I 
can tell. Is that wrong?


&gt;<i> If that fails and there is a data attribute, check the Content-Type
</I>&gt;<i> sent by the server for the file and determine if there's a handler
</I>&gt;<i> associated with the type.
</I>
The spec honours the Content-Type header over all else if it is present 
and classid=&quot;&quot; isn't.


&gt;<i> If there is a handler associated with the type, pass all arguments to
</I>&gt;<i> the handler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is not, the UA *should* compare the file extension to a list
</I>&gt;<i> of known Content-Types associated with that extension.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a handler is found, pass all arguments to the handler.
</I>
I do not want to add any extension-sniffing to the spec, it is too 
dangerous, highly unreliable, and as far as I can tell isn't necessary.


&gt;<i> ( URIs to files should be passed to the handler and the handler should 
</I>&gt;<i> download the files as necessary. The Ua should not download the file on 
</I>&gt;<i> its own. Only the handler should make that request to the UA.)
</I>
Really?


&gt;<i> Once the handler gets the arguments, it *must* detmermine whether it has 
</I>&gt;<i> the necessary and valid arguments to initialize. If it does not, it 
</I>&gt;<i> should return a failure code. If it does, it should try to initialize 
</I>&gt;<i> and if successful, return a success code; otherwise, return a failure 
</I>&gt;<i> code. The handler should return a failure code in every situation where 
</I>&gt;<i> there's no need to initialize in the first place.
</I>
This is out of our scope.


&gt;<i> The UA must check for this return code to determine whether to display 
</I>&gt;<i> fallback content.
</I>
It's not clear to me how to tell if a plugin failed.

I don't really see how to handle this feedback. We can't really make the

Java needs to get over itself and stop being such a drama queen and just
