The short answer is that we had to pick something, and &quot;.&quot; was consistent 
with the attribute syntax, CSS, and JS. (The idea is that CSS can be used 
(once number formatting is supported) to render the number as desired, 
though of course that won't be relevant for &lt;meter&gt; and &lt;progress&gt; since 
they are coming first.) In practice, anyway, attributes can be used to 
disambiguate.

Notice that the spec doesn't really support English either -- in English 
large numbers have thousands separated by commas, and the spec doesn't 
support that at all.

Indeed.

class=&quot;price&quot; is gone; q.v. the currency Microformat.

It actually means 2 out of 500. :-)

It's only supported as an easy way of doing fallback. In practice I would 
expect people to use integers less than 1000, so the issue doesn't even 
arise.

Yup.

That's not a bad idea... Bit complicated though...

Why would it fail for integers?

Did you learn anything relevant to this discussion from that weekend? (Or 
any other weekend. :-) )

Right.


&gt;<i> Note that the &lt;meter&gt; description reads (as an &quot;Authoring requirements&quot; !!!):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The recommended way of giving the value is to include it as contents of

</I>&gt;<i> maximum, the other number the current value), or as a percentage or 
</I>&gt;<i> similar (using one of the characters such as &quot;%&quot;), or as a fraction.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the &lt;progress&gt; description reads:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Instead of using the attributes, authors are recommended to simply 
</I>&gt;<i> include the current value and the maximum value inline as text inside 
</I>&gt;<i> the element.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fully understand the rationale behind this (ease of editing 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211;changing the value once, at a single place&#8211; means ease of 
</I>&gt;<i> adoption), but I18N is important too.
</I>
Sure, but when would &quot;12%&quot; not work for non-English cases?


&gt;<i> Having mandatory attributes also makes writing parsers easier, because 
</I>&gt;<i> you no longer need the &quot;steps for finding one or two numbers of a ratio 
</I>&gt;<i> in a string&quot; part ;-)
</I>
Are they that big a problem?


&gt;<i> And how about &quot;vulgar fraction characters&quot; like &#188; (U+00BC VULGAR 
</I>&gt;<i> FRACTION ONE QUARTER) and other numeric characters from the &#65296;(U+FF10 
</I>&gt;<i> FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO) to&#65305;(U+FF19 FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE) or &#8544; (U+2160 
</I>&gt;<i> ROMAN NUMERAL ONE) to &#8578; (U+2182 ROMAN NUMERAL TEN THOUSAND) ranges?
</I>
What about them?


&gt;<i> I don't know which is better (parsing only &quot;english-form numbers&quot; out of 
</I>&gt;<i> textContent, or having attributes mandatory), but the two 
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations towards using textContent to convey the values, 
</I>&gt;<i> preferably to using attributes, is only relevant to english 
</I>&gt;<i> documents/sections, or actually any language with the same number

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I know is that I don't want language-dependent number parsing to 
</I>&gt;<i> appear in the spec ;-)
</I>
I think for the common cases (small integers) the current text works in 
all languages. That it works in mildly more complex cases in English is a 
minor bonus.

</I>
The problem with putting values in attributes is that it breaks legacy 
UAs. I would guess the &quot;best practice&quot; recommendation would change once 
UAs that support these features are widely used.

I don't really see much point in going out of our way to support more 
complex numbers.
