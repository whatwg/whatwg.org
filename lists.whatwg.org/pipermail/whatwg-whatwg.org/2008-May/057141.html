The property was always there, though, from the JS point of view.

And there is even a plausible mapping for delete (style.removeProperty).

style.removeProperty does not remove the JS property, so from the JS point
of view it's a misnomer.

Ultimately the conclusion I question is that having obj.foo and obj.foo =
&gt;<i> ... work, but not delete obj.foo, will create confusion or is somehow
</I>&gt;<i> illogical. I don't believe it will create confusion, and I think style is a
</I>&gt;<i> relevant example of a case where it has not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
FWIW, I see &quot;style.opacity = '';&quot; far more often than removeProperty. I
don't think authors don't think of 'style' as a container to which they can
add and remove arbitrary properties, so I continue to maintain it's not
relevant to their expectations for storage.

I don't care all that much. But since it's convenience with some use, and
we've already implemented it and so has IE, I think we'd want a pretty
strong argument to remove it.
