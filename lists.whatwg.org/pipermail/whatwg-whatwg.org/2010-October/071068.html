That makes sense. However,this is removing some possibilities with the
pattern attribute. For example, the author wouldn't be able to ask for
different emails with at least one from company A and company B. In
addition, asking for &quot;at least x emails&quot;, &quot;exactly y emails&quot; or &quot;maximum
z emails&quot; wouldn't be possible.
Though, the former case doesn't sound to be important and the later
would be better with new attributes like minentries and maxentries.

&gt;<i> I also realized that @list currently is pretty useless in similar
</I>&gt;<i> situations together with &lt;input type=text&gt;. Often times text inputs
</I>&gt;<i> are used to enter a list of tokens. One example is the keyword input
</I>&gt;<i> field in bugzilla. It helps you autocomplete from the list of
</I>&gt;<i> available keywords, but also lets you enter multiple keywords in the
</I>&gt;<i> same text field. As things stand now you can't use @list to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> this as it operates on the whole value rather than each comma
</I>&gt;<i> separated token.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be possible to make this work by allowing @multiple to apply
</I>&gt;<i> to &lt;input type=text&gt;. The only effect would be that @list and @pattern
</I>&gt;<i> would operate on each comma separated token.
</I>
A more common use case would be tag/keywords list on blogs/websites.
Currently CMS must provide their own UI for that. list+multiple might be
really helpful.
