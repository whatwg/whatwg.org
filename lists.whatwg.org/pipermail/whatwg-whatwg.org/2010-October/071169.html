Philip's research earlier from this thread was as follows:

; appears at the beginning of lines in 15/10000 files and most don't look
like they're intended as comments.

# appears at the beginning of lines in 244/10000 files and most don't look
like they're intended as comments.

/* only appears in 3/10000 files, so CSS-style comments might work, but
does add some complexity

// appears at the beginning of lines in 5/10000 files and most look like
that *are* intended as comments or are garbage, so it should work.

(data from OpenSubtitles sample)

which seems to support the choice of //.

I do wonder what the lines that start with ; or # contained though.



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I agree that at least a magic header like &quot;WebSRT&quot; is needed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the horrors of legacy SRT parsing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see why we can't just consume the legacy and support it in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> WebSRT. Part of the point with WebSRT is to support the legacy. If we don't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want to support the legacy, then the format can be made a lot cleaner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Did you read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-October/028799.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-October/028799.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and look at &lt;<A HREF="http://ale5000.altervista.org/subtitles.htm">http://ale5000.altervista.org/subtitles.htm</A>&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you think it's a good idea to make WebSRT an extension of ale5000-SRT?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. :-) We could remove stuff from ale5000-SRT if there isn't interop
</I>&gt;<i> already and the relevant vendors agree to remove it from their impls.
</I>

We'd just be adding to the already existing mess. Actually, such a
choice will encourage people to invent and use whatever tags they
like, because that has been the tradition with SRT. What exists is a
mess. We add to the mess, disallowing some of the existing tags that
are in wide us. People ignore that - existing applications already
support them anyway. So, we will have to adapt with those existing
tags - eventually we end up with the ale5000-SRT mess. Honestly, not a
great idea.


&gt;&gt;<i> My opinion is that it's not a very good idea, which of course we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simplify some aspects of the format. For example, we don't need to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both , and . as the millisecond separator, and the time parsing in general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be made more sane.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think browsers will support vanilla SRT (i.e. ale5000-SRT) as well?
</I>
Not browsers - at least not at first. But other applications do, and
many support a large amount of them. So, if we want to support legacy,
we have to bite the bullet - eventually.

Cheers
Silvia.
