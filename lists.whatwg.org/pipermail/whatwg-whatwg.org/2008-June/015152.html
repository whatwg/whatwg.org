</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have changed my view on this. Only a DNS record is required:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A script by default can only connect to the server that it was
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded from.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Server A has a script that tries to connect to Server B. Server B
</I>&gt;<i> must have a record in its DNS that allows scripts originating from
</I>&gt;<i> Server A.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing more should be needed, a DDOS attack using javascript can
</I>&gt;<i> never succed unless the attacker controls the DNS servers. I think
</I>&gt;<i> this DNS method could be used for all cross site scripting security
</I>&gt;<i> policies (java applets, flash etc). Additionally, the client can have
</I>&gt;<i> policies disallowing reconnects in for example one minute, if the
</I>&gt;<i> server responds with HTTP 401 Access Denied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So what we want is a http based protocol which allow the client to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> continue communicating with the script that handles the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> request.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I absolutely agree that this would be the best way. However, couldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we use Michaels proposal for that? It seems to solve the same problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and is actually compliant HTTP (in theory at least).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should have both a pure TCPConnection, and a ServerConnection
</I>&gt;<i> object. It could possibly be based on the BEEP protocol, i dont know
</I>&gt;<i> that protocol. All I know is that HTTP has mechanisms for switching
</I>&gt;<i> protocols (HTTP 101 Switching Protocols), and is a good basis for
</I>&gt;<i> browser to webserver communications already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ServerConnection should have some mechanisms in the protocol that
</I>&gt;<i> allows transmission of events from the server and to the server - as
</I>&gt;<i> well as sending variables/structures. Example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> var data = { name: &quot;Frode B&#248;rli&quot;, address: &quot;Norway&quot; }
</I>&gt;<i> document.serverConnection.send(data)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also the client can add arbitrary event listeners to the
</I>&gt;<i> serverConnection object:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> document.serverConnection.onwhatever = function(message) {
</I>&gt;<i> alert(message.city); }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The server should be able to listen to all DOM events also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I find the SessionID header a very good idea though.What are the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoughts on that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sorry if that has already been discussed, but if we use HTTP, why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't we use the Access Control spec as an &quot;opt in mechanism&quot; that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a little easier to implement than DNS? If you modify the behaviour a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little, you could even use it against DDOS attacks:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without DNS records (or an alternative implementation) i think the
</I>&gt;<i> TCPConnection and the ServerConnection object should be restricted by
</I>&gt;<i> the same rules as XMLHttpRequest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Counter suggestion&quot;: When a WebSocket objects attempts to connect,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perform Access Control checks the way you would for POST requests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the check fails and if the server response contains an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Access-Control-Max-Age header, agents must immediately close the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection and must not open a connection to that resource again (or,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if Access-Control-Policy-Path is present, to any resource specified)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until the specified time has elapsed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That way, administrators that are hit by a DDOS can simply put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By securing with DNS records, administrators will not have to do
</I>&gt;<i> anything to prevent ddos, as it can't happen. Without DNS records, the
</I>&gt;<i> script is allowed only to connect to the same server that it was
</I>&gt;<i> fetched from. (Same as Java applets, Flash applets and XMLHttpRequest)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Access-Control: allow &lt;*&gt; exclude &lt;evilsite.example.com&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Access-Control-Policy-Path: /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the idea is good, but I do not like the exact implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the server should be able to see which script is initiating
</I>&gt;<i> the connection (header sent from the client), and then the server can
</I>&gt;<i> respond with a HTTP 401 Access Denied. No need to specify anything
</I>&gt;<i> more. No need to specify which hosts that are allowed, since the
</I>&gt;<i> script can decide that on a number of parameters (like IP-address
</I>&gt;<i> etc).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>What if the DDOS attack is on the DNS servers rather that the server 
you're supposedly connecting to? I might be wrong, but you could always 
ask for a TCPConnection for each of an unlimited amount of bogus 
subdomains which could overload the DNS server with record requests. 
Just a thought.
