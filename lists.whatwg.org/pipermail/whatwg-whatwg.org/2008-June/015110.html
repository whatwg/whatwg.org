You misunderstand; it's not the ports that are limited, it's just that the 
traffic can now pass for HTTP. This would all still work over any 
arbitrary port.

</I>
Indeed, we would need to very carefully define exactly what the server 
must send back, much like in the original protocol -- it would just look a 
lot more like HTTP. This would include at least one custom header or value 
that you wouldn't see elsewhere (e.g. the Upgrade: header with the magic 
value).


&gt;<i> Since the script author can also inject URIs into the handshake this 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a potential flaw.
</I>
Indeed, we'd have to throw if the URI wasn't a valid URI (e.g. if it 
included newlines).


&gt;<i> One last thing. Does anybody know how async communication would affect 
</I>&gt;<i> common proxies (forward and reverse)? I imagine they can handle large 
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of POST data but how do they feel about a forcibly held-open 
</I>&gt;<i> by-directional communication that never calls POST or GET?
</I>
That's basically what TLS is, right? The simple solution would be to just 
tunnel everything through TLS when you hit an uncooperative proxy.
