Implementors, please see the question at the bottom.

Done.

This will be defined when I define &quot;URI&quot; more carefully (the answer is 
yes, as the empty string is a valid URI reference, as I understand it).


&gt;<i> # User agents must use the value of the href attribute on the first base

</I>
IE7 does it. I recall doing a study on whether it was a big problem, and 
it seemed like while there were pages that relied on the multi-base 
support, there were also many pages that broke because of it. Mozilla goes 
through some weird contortions to support it. If we can get away with not 
doing it, I think it's worth it.


&gt;<i> # In a head element, before any elements that use relative URIs, and
</I>&gt;<i> # only if there are no other base elements anywhere in the document.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be simpler to just require &lt;base&gt; to be before any elements 
</I>&gt;<i> that use URIs period. It's easier to express, and there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> invalidation surprises if one changes an absolute URI to a relative one 
</I>&gt;<i> later on.
</I>
It seems we changed to this at some point already.

</I>
I think that would be a confusing requirement. As far as I can tell the 
requirement you mention on meta charset is gone now.

</I>
I agree that it's a pretty dumb thing to do.


&gt;<i> There would definitely be overhead unfortunately. First of all in lots

</I>&gt;<i> appropriate listeners to the notification, and managing the lifetime of

</I>&gt;<i> lists of who listens to what subtrees.
</I>
There's no need to keep track of that, the listeners are just all the 
descendants. Just walk the tree notifying everyone.


&gt;<i> My guess is that supporting dynamic modifications would be one of those 
</I>&gt;<i> features that someone would file a bug on early on during testing of a 
</I>&gt;<i> UA implementation, and then nobody would care about a very long time, 
</I>&gt;<i> including both web developers and UA developers. Especially given that 
</I>&gt;<i> the feature would be missing from all other UAs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But yeah, I have no real good solution either. We could either say that 
</I>&gt;<i> uris MAY not be immediately updated in the face of dynamic 
</I>&gt;<i> modifications. Which would probably suffer from some amout of 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation differences. Or we could say MUST be immediately updated 
</I>&gt;<i> and probably still suffer from implemenation differences due to lack of 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>
What we need, therefore, is a solution that everyone can agree on and can 
agree is implementable in a timely fashion, which still gives us 
interoperable behaviour. I'm not sure what that could be.

</I>
Well, we'd have to define that either way.

Indeed.

Then we need to define &quot;resolve&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; For example on a &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;, does the user hovering the node

</I>&gt;<i> changed.
</I>
What if the URL changes as you're hovering? Does the URL get resolved at 
50Hz, or does it get resolved when it is first displayed?

Same with :link vs :visited -- when do you redecide what the URL is for 
the purposes of styling? There's no clearly defined or definable time that 
this happens, as far as I can tell.

I agree with these points.

This seems like it would have more overhead than just notifying everyone 
in the subtree.

Well, right now it's implicitly defined that changing the base changes 
anything refering to that base instantly. I'm not really sure how to 
unspecify that without adding a really weird clause like &quot;in the event 
that the attribute is changed, user agents may, whenever convenient, 
pretend, for the sake of url resolution, that it has not changed&quot;.


I have made notes in the spec that this is an area that needs defining. 
Right now I'm leaning towards defining a &quot;base href change notification 
behaviour&quot; for all elements that have URI attributes or are otherwise 
sensitive to base href changes, and defining that when the base href 
changes, all the elements in the document with such behaviour defined 
should have that behaviour activated (this would, in the simple case, just 
be a walk over the document with a virtual method call per element; it 
might be a bit slow for some documents, but then this is a very rare 
occurance anyway). We would also invoke this behaviour on the entire 
subtree of an element whenever that element is inserted into a different 
document, in case it matters in any cases.

In practice I think this only actually affects :link/:visited and url() 
rules in style=&quot;&quot; attributes. I plan on making &lt;img&gt;/&lt;iframe&gt;/&lt;link 
rel=stylesheet&gt; etc not reload their content if the base href changes 
(though that does mean that .src and .href will end up pointing to URIs 
that aren't actually what was loaded). I can't think of any other cases 
that are sensitive off the top of my head, but I'll be thorough if I do 
end up specifying this.

The question is, are people ok with that plan?
