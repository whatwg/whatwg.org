Right, it is. The user-agent is free to map all property values to &quot;maximum
quality&quot;.

Ignored by who?

Neither of these apply if the property were just a hint, but now you have to
&gt;<i> think about what happens to content that uses this property in 18 months
</I>&gt;<i> time.  You've told the UA to use a low quality rendering when it may no
</I>&gt;<i> longer be necessary, so now the UA has a choice it either always obeys the
</I>&gt;<i> property meaning lower quality than is necessary so that new content
</I>&gt;<i> performs well, or it ignores the property in which case new content performs
</I>&gt;<i> badly.
</I>

If the quality knob is no longer necessary, why would new content perform
badly?

These hint properties are opt-in for UAs. If you don't like the idea, just
treat all values as &quot;auto&quot;.
