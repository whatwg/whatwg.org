This is intended to support negative arguments, hence the mention of 
&quot;absolute magnitude&quot; in the definition of what the method does. This is 
for consistency with the other methods, which work fine with negative 
dimensions.


&gt;<i> Additionally sw and sh are both floats and can therefore have a fractional

</I>
I don't think we want to make exception raising be dependent on the 
resolution of the backing store, since that's a UA decision. I think it 
makes more sense to make the height and width be always at least 1. Right 
now UAs are required to do this, though it's not explicitly stated in 
terms of rounding. I can add a note if you like.

(I've added createImageData() to the paragraph that talks about device 
rounding, by the way. This was an unintentional omission.)


&gt;<i> The other issues relate to the data member of ImageData.  Currently this 
</I>&gt;<i> is referred to as an int array, however the DOM does not define such an

</I>
I've added a CanvasPixelArray interface and used that. (The setter and 
getter are temporarily named XXX5 and XXX6 while we wait for WebIDL to 
have a way to hide members from objects.)

They don't have to. As Philip says:

The spec doesn't require roundtrip, so I'm not sure what the note would 
say.


&gt;<i> The other issue is the behaviour of NaN in ImageData.  Currently the

I believe the spec now requires this.

</I>
&quot;dangerous&quot; may be the wrong term. The real problem is that there's no 
real way to find out what the dimensions should be without calling 
createID() or getID(), and once you've done that you might as well just 
reuse the object you were handed.


&gt;<i> However, regardless of that, I don't think there's a reason to disallow 
</I>&gt;<i> custom-created data objects, perhaps with a caveat that there may be 
</I>&gt;<i> issues.. get/putImageData in Firefox 2, so adding that restriction may 
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily break existing code that uses putImageData with a hand- 
</I>&gt;<i> constructed ImageData object.
</I>
The restriction was put in because of a request from the WebKit guys to 
enable them to do order-of-magnitude performance improvements. On the long 
term, I think we're better of enabling those performance improvements than 
supporting the earliest users of the API, especially given that those uses 
only ever worked in one UA.


&gt;<i> I would amend the spec to state that if an object is passed to 
</I>&gt;<i> putImageData with the necessary properties, but without having been 
</I>&gt;<i> created by create/getImageData beforehand, that its dimensions are aways 
</I>&gt;<i> in device pixels.
</I>
We could support a conversion from custom (JS) objects to native ImageData 
objects when the method is passed a non-native object, but that seems like 
a lot of complications for little gain. After all, calling 
createImageData() isn't an onerous requirement.


&gt;<i> One problem with the desired goal of resolution independence is that it 
</I>&gt;<i> only really makes sense if the target resolution is an integer multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> of a CSS pixel.  For example, with a 144dpi output device, that's 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly 1.5 times CSS resolution.  If I call createImageData with 
</I>&gt;<i> dimensions 10,10, I would get an ImageData object with width 15 and 
</I>&gt;<i> height 15.  What do I get if I call it with 11,11 though?  That's 16.5 
</I>&gt;<i> device pixels, and you're going to lose data either way you go, because 
</I>&gt;<i> at putImageData time you're going to get seams no matter what direction 
</I>&gt;<i> you round.  This can maybe be solved with language in the spec that 
</I>&gt;<i> specifies that a canvas should use a different ratio of CSS pixels to 
</I>&gt;<i> device pixels only if one is an integer multiple of the other, but that 
</I>&gt;<i> seems like an odd limitation (and it still requires the implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> to decide what to do if a clean ratio isn't possible).
</I>
I don't understand what use cases you are expecting where this would be a 
problem. Typically the idea here is doing filters or generating patterns 
like clouds or fractals, in which case, so long as the UA follows the 
spec's rules on rounding behaviour, the seams shouldn't be a big problem. 
Could you illustrate the case you are concerned about with an example?


&gt;<i> Another approach would be to not try to solve this in canvas at all, and
</I>&gt;<i> instead specify that by default, all canvas elements are 96dpi, and provide
</I>&gt;<i> authors a way to explicitly override this -- then using a combination of CSS
</I>&gt;<i> Media Queries and other CSS, the exact dpi desired could be specified.  (You
</I>&gt;<i> can sort of do this today, given that the canvas width/height attributes are
</I>&gt;<i> in CSS pixels, and that if CSS dimensions are present a canvas is scaled like
</I>&gt;<i> an image... so canvas { width: 100px; height: 100px; } ... &lt;canvas width=&quot;200&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt; would give a 192dpi canvas today, no?)
</I>
A UA would be quite within its rights today to make that a canvas with a 
native backing store dimension of 100x100. It could also make it 
4000x4000. There's really no reason for the user to know.

Right, the resolution in &quot;resolution-dependent&quot; being the display's native 
resolution. It was always intended (at least from my point of view, and as 
I understand it from the original Apple proposal) that &lt;canvas&gt; provide a 
way to render bitmap graphics that will always be the &quot;best&quot; resolution 
for the display. Resolution-independent from the author's point of view.


[snipped a discussion about whether to change some of the current 
validation rules, since it concluded that the current spec was fine]

The request seems to be aimed at addressing the small number of existing 
sites already deployed that rely on the Firefox 2 implementation. There 
doesn't seem to be an actual use case for the feature other than that.

Given this, and given that other UAs have already made changes that are 
incompatible with these very, very early pages in order to line up with 
the needs of implementations such as Mozilla, I don't think it really 
makes sense to add this to the spec. It isn't at all clear that other UAs 
actually want to support this anyway; indeed even Mozilla implementors 
seem reluctant to continue to support it (q.v. Jonas' comment above).

Vlad: I realise that this basically consists of rejecting your feedback on 
this, but I'm not sure how else to proceed given the clear statement from 
at least one other vendor that they don't want this feature. Sorry.
