</I>&gt;<i> It isn't difficult to imagine all kinds of additional playback states.

</I>&gt;<i> with those &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; buttons) How could those states be added?
</I>
This is already supported, and is independent of the pause state. (You 
could easily imagine a UI where you could pause while fast-forwarding.)


&gt;<i> The media error state is also inconsistent, and this time for no 
</I>&gt;<i> apparent reason, although it would at least be easy to update. A more 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent design would be to have an &quot;errorState&quot; attribute that is one 
</I>&gt;<i> of: NO_ERROR, ABORTED, NETWORK_ERROR, DECODING_ERROR
</I>
We want to be able to include much more information, hence the use of an 
object for now.


&gt;<i> And why are the error state names prefixed with &quot;MEDIA_ERR&quot; when the 
</I>&gt;<i> names for the other states are not prefixed? e.g. LOADING instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> MEDIA_NET_LOADING.
</I>
The other state constants are prefixed (LOAD and CAN_ respectively) except 
for the zero state (which doesn't have a constant at all for errors).

Indeed, we're unlikely to ever add states, we're more likely to add 
orthogonal attributes.
