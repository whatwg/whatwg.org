I'm not sure what to do about this. I guess maybe we should just make 
&lt;map&gt; 'display:inline' in the default CSS?

Ok it's only on &lt;img&gt; and &lt;object&gt;.

I've changed the spec to require name=&quot;&quot; instead of requiring id=&quot;&quot;, based 
on the collective feedback on this issue.


&gt;<i> So, it seems it might have to be case-sensitive for xhtml5 (since other

</I>
I'm trying to minimise the differences, so I've left it as insensitive.

</I>
The only time this would break anything is if a page is using XML _and_ 
relying on two names different only in case to match differently. That's a 
pretty specific case and unless someone knows of a case that does this, 
I'm willing to risk breaking it to get the simplicity of fewer 
differences between the modes.

</I>
It already is inconsistent for usemap=&quot;&quot;. At least for legacy Web content 
I don't think we can do much about it. At that point, I'd rather just 
extend that to XHTML than to keep another difference.

Well, they should be using name=&quot;&quot; anyway, so it's not like they'll run 
into this much.


&gt;<i> In gecko we keep a hash for id-&gt;element which is case sensitive. This

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> What you suggest is to add a third hash for id-&gt;element which would be

</I>
I think a hash would be overkill for this, except for the rare case 
where there are a lot of &lt;map&gt;s.
