This is defined now by the way.


&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with scaling to the poster's size is that it would make

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once (300x150 blank, then poster -&gt; video).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If poster is to &lt;video&gt; what src is to &lt;img&gt;, then surely the video 
</I>&gt;<i> element should take the size of the poster image if no width/height is 
</I>&gt;<i> given? This is certainly my preference, as width/height would otherwise 
</I>&gt;<i> effectively be mandatory when poster is used, which would in turn 
</I>&gt;<i> require the poster to be of the same size as the video unless one is to 
</I>&gt;<i> be scaled.
</I>
Why? The posted would be displayed in the default 300x150 box.


&gt;<i> That the element may be resized twice is not a problem, at 
</I>&gt;<i> least not implementation-wise.
</I>
That it's resized at all is a terrible problem; that it woul resize twice 
would be a disaster, UI-wise.


&gt;<i> As some container formats allow changing the video frame size mid-stream 
</I>&gt;<i> (notably chained Ogg streams, so called sequential multiplexing) the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> could possibly resize the video element an unlimited number of times, so 
</I>&gt;<i> handling that is necessary anyway.
</I>
That's not the common case, though; a poster is.


&gt;<i> On that note, perhaps an event to notify JavaScript UIs of such changes 
</I>&gt;<i> would be useful/necessary. Perhaps reusing &quot;resize&quot; event would be the 
</I>&gt;<i> best, other names could be &quot;videochange&quot; or &quot;sizechange&quot;.
</I>
I've noted this for a v3 feature.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; HTTP 4xx and 5xx errors (and equivalents in other protocols) must 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (may?) cause the user agent to ignore the poster attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well what else are they going to do? HTTP already requires this as far 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that Safari shows a little X symbol instead, but perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> specifying this behavior is not necessary. We will likely ignore the 
</I>&gt;<i> poster attribute entirely instead.
</I>
Showing a red X seems contrary to the spec (which says that the &lt;video&gt; 
element represents the poster, the video, or nothing), but really 
rendering things are out of scope of the spec. In any case, in a few years 
we'll probably look at what implementations do and specify what the 
implementations have converged on.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure a fake button (which wouldn't actually work anyway) is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; natural interpretation of &quot;poster frame&quot;. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As long as it's mentioned somewhere there can be no misunderstanding.
</I>
Ok, added a note.
