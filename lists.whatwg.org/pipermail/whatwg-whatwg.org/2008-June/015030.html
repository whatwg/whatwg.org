How can an author know which is appropriate?


&gt;<i> This is modeled on the SVG image-rendering property, at

This seems to be something that is completely inappropriate for SVG or for 
canvas. The UA should make its own tradeoffs, likely tradeoffs that don't 
even remotely fit into the categories above (e.g. adapting to scripts that 
do animations to converge on the best quality possible at 30fps, or 
optimise for memory usage).

Why not just have the UA run in a high quality mode the first time it is 
painted on, but if the script tries to paint again within a certain amount 
of time, switch to high speed?

Trusting the author to do this right seems like a fantastically bad idea.

That neatly moves the problem away from the canvas API, and thus it 
wouldn't be my problem necessarily, but I still don't think it'd be a good 
idea. :-)

That line of reasoning seems correct to me.

That's naive, I'm afraid. In practice, sites are written and abandoned, 
and don't get fixed.

There's not much point us adding the feature if multiple UAs aren't going 
to implement it.

Also, if it's a hint, then it's untestable, and we wouldn't be able to 
prove interoperability, which again makes it something not really worth 
adding to the spec.

The point is that you have no way to know whether you need to enable the 
speed optimisation or the quality optimisation. Say you're doing something 
which runs fine on a high-end Dell machine, runs ok on a Wii, and runs 
terribly on an iPhone. What setting do you use?

The decision would have to change over time as well, indeed, something 
which is just as hard for the author to deal with as multiple platforms.

Wouldn't it be better for the platform to decide that for itself?

Why wouldn't the platform just support that natively instead of requiring 
every Web developer to do it manually?
