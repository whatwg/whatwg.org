I completely agree.  Almost any feature can be abused.  It's not our  
job to withhold features just because they can be abused.  It's also  
worth pointing out that this is a common graphical knob supported by  
Cairo and CoreGraphics.  It is a proprietary MS CSS property and an  
SVG CSS property.  In other words, it seems to be a pretty widely  
implemented feature and as such seems like it would be a worthwhile  
addition to canvas.

If we add this, we should also add support for text rendering quality  
as well, since canvas is picking up the ability to draw text.
