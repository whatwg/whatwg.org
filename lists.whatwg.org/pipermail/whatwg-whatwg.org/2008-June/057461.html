As far as I know I can't exhibit a test demonstrating IE switching from 
&quot;uninitialized&quot; to &quot;loading.&quot;  The document is normally in the &quot;loading&quot; 
state before you get your hands on it.  If testability is the top priority 
then the spec probably shouldn't change.

There is a way to get a document in the &quot;uninitialized&quot; state using 
document.createDocumentFragment().  IE erroneously creates a document in 
that case instead of a document fragment; the document has readyState 
&quot;uninitialized&quot;.  However, there is no way to take that document and get 
it into a &quot;loading&quot; state as far as I know (obvious methods like .open() 
just throw errors instead).

Furthermore, MSDN *does* claim that &quot;the states through which an object 
passes are determined by that object; an object can skip certain states 
(for example, interactive) if the state does not apply to that object.&quot;

So, the current state of the spec is certainly defensible.

However, I note that it would be legal under the terms of the MSDN 
specification if some future version of IE *did* expose a way to make an 
uninitialized document on which you could later call .open(), and the 
HTML5 spec as-is would make that illegal.

It's tempting to say that the readyState can start with either 
&quot;uninitialized&quot; or &quot;loading&quot;; certainly it's odd that we'd just hike it up 
to &quot;loading&quot; because our test mechanisms are usually too coarse-grained to 
detect a readyState in its &quot;uninitialized&quot; state.

But, oddity is par for the course in DOM, so I guess we'll just follow the 
HTML 5 spec as-is, initialize readyState to &quot;loading&quot; in the object 
constructor, and keep our fingers crossed.
