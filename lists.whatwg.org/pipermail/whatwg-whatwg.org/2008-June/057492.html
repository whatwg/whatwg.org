I've done a huge rewrite of everything URL-related now which should 
resolve all these issues and make everything consistent and (hopefully) 
realistic.

</I>&gt;<i> percent-encoded byte-by-byte, by encoding the URI based on the
</I>&gt;<i> encoding of the document.
</I>
It's mildly more complicated than that, it seems, since path components 
always seem to use UTF-8 and query components use the doc encoding, but in 
any case, the spec now specified this.

Please let me know if the spec, as it stands, is acceptable.
