&gt;<i> I have been reading up on past discussions on sandboxing content, and
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that it is generally agreed on that there should be some
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for marking content as &quot;user generated&quot;. The discussion
</I>&gt;<i> mainly appears to be focused on implementation. Please read my
</I>&gt;<i> implementation notes at the end of this message on how we can include
</I>&gt;<i> this function safely for both HTML 4 and HTML 5 browsers, and still
</I>&gt;<i> allow HTML 4 browsers to function properly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main arguments for having this feature (in one form or another) in
</I>&gt;<i> the browser is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It is future proof. Changes to browsers (for example adding
</I>&gt;<i> expression support to css) will never again require old sanitizers to
</I>&gt;<i> be updated.
</I>
If the sanitiser uses a whitelist based approach that forbids everything 
by default, and then only allows known elements and attributes; and in 
the case of the style attribute, known properties and values that are 
safe, then that would also be the case.

&gt;<i> - It does not require much skill and effort from the web developer to
</I>&gt;<i> safely sanitize user content.
</I>&gt;<i> - Security bugs are fixed by browser vendors, and not by each web developer.
</I>
Note that sandboxing doesn't entirely remove the need for sanitising 
user generated content on the server, it's just an extra line of defence 
in case something slips through.

&gt;<i> The suggested solution of using an attribute on an &lt;iframe&gt; element
</I>&gt;<i> for storing the user generated content has several problems;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1: The use of src= as a fallback means that style information will be
</I>&gt;<i> lost and stylesheets must be loaded again.
</I>
This is not a major problem.  If it uses the same stylesheet, which can 
be cached by the browser, then at worst it results in a 304 Not Modified 
response.

&gt;<i> 2: The use of src= yields problems with iframe heights (since the
</I>&gt;<i> src-url must be hosted on another server javascript cannot fix this)
</I>&gt;<i> and HTML 4 browsers have no other method of adjusting the iframe
</I>&gt;<i> height according to the content.
</I>
In recent browsers that support cross-document messaging (Opera 9, 
Safari 3, Firefox 3 and IE 8), you could include a script within the 
comment page that calculates its own height and sends a message to the 
parent page with the info.  In older browsers, just set the height to a 
reasonable minimum and let the user scroll.  Sure, it's not perfect, but 
it's called graceul degradation.

&gt;<i> 3: If you have a page that lists 60 comments on a blog, then the user
</I>&gt;<i> agent would have to contact the server 60 times to fetch each comment.
</I>&gt;<i> This again means that perl/php scripts have to be invoked 60 times for
</I>&gt;<i> one page view - that is 61 separate database connections and session
</I>&gt;<i> initializations.
</I>
You could always concatenate all of the comments into a single file, 
reducing it down to 1 request.

&gt;<i> 4: For the fallback method of using src= for HTML 4 browsers to
</I>&gt;<i> actually work, the fallback documents must be hosted on a separate
</I>&gt;<i> domain name. This again means that a website using HTTPS must purchase
</I>&gt;<i> and maintain two certificates.
</I>
I don't see that as a show stopper.

&gt;<i> My solution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we add a new element &lt;htmlarea&gt;&lt;/htmlarea&gt;, old browsers will run
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, while new browsers will stop scripts and this is a major
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If HTML 5 browsers require everything between &lt;htmlarea&gt;&lt;/htmlarea&gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> be html entity escaped, that is &lt; and &gt; must be replaced with &lt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; respectively. If this is not done, HTML 5 browsers will issue a
</I>&gt;<i> severe warning and refuse to display the page. Developers will quickly
</I>&gt;<i> learn.
</I>
Draconian error handling is something we really want to avoid, 
particularly when the such an error can be triggered by failing to 
handle user generated content properly.

&gt;<i> HTML 4 browsers will never run scripts (since it will only see plain
</I>&gt;<i> text). HTML 5 browsers will display rich text. It would be completely
</I>&gt;<i> secure for both HTML 4 and HTML 5 browsers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A simple Javascript could clean up the HTML markup for HTML 4 browsers..
</I>
In a separate mail, you wrote:
&gt;<i> &lt;data&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;user supplied input&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/data&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then this will be secure both for HTML 4 and HTML 5 browsers. HTML 4
</I>&gt;<i> browsers will display html, while HTML 5 browsers will display
</I>&gt;<i> correctly formatted code. A simple javascript like this (untested)
</I>&gt;<i> would make the data tags readable for HTML 4 browsers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> var els = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;DATA&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> for(e in els) els[e].innerHTML =
</I>&gt;<i> els[e].innerHTML.replace(/&lt;&#91;^&gt;&#93;*&gt;/g, &quot;&quot;).replace(/\n/g,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;);
</I>
At first, I had no idea what that script was trying to do.  But AFAICT, 
you were trying to use this regex: /&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/g, which would theoretically 
match &quot;&lt;foo&gt;&quot;.  But, in this context, even with the corrected regex, the 
script is entirely useless.

It wouldn't work, for example, with &lt;foo bar=&quot;&gt;&quot; baz=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;.  But also 
because the inner HTML that you're running the regex on is supposed to 
have all &lt; and &gt; escaped, and so nothing would be matched anyway.

&gt;<i> A problem with this approach is that developers might forget to escape
</I>&gt;<i> tags, therefore I think browsers should display a security warning
</I>&gt;<i> message if the character &lt; or &gt; is encountered inside a &lt;data&gt; tag.
</I>
If a developer forgot to escape the markup at all, then a user could 
enter &quot;&lt;/data&gt;&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;&quot; and do anything they wanted.
