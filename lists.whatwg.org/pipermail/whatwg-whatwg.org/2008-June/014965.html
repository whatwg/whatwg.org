Given a few years all UA's as the majority of content saying &quot;low  
quality&quot; will be old, and therefore targeting slower UAs and platforms  
(given moore's law, and the fact that all UAs are currently getting  
faster this seems a reasonable assertion) so respecting it would mean  
the majority of sites using low quality mode would not need to.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither of these apply if the property were just a hint, but now you  
</I>&gt;<i> have to think about what happens to content that uses this property  
</I>&gt;<i> in 18 months time.  You've told the UA to use a low quality  
</I>&gt;<i> rendering when it may no longer be necessary, so now the UA has a  
</I>&gt;<i> choice it either always obeys the property meaning lower quality  
</I>&gt;<i> than is necessary so that new content performs well, or it ignores  
</I>&gt;<i> the property in which case new content performs badly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the quality knob is no longer necessary, why would new content  
</I>&gt;<i> perform badly?
</I>The issue is not that certain operations are slower than others, the  
issue is that anything that requires the developer to choose between  
performance/quality is going to become obsolete as the performance  
trade offs are constantly moving and are not the same from UA to UA,  
from platform to platform.  I think the issue of performance is a  
complex one that will not benefit in the long term from a simple on  
off switch.  Conceivably we could introduce new rendering primitives,  
such as CanvasSprite, CanvasLayer, or some such which would, i  
suspect, provide a similar benefit, but be more resilient in the face  
of changing performance characteristics.
