-- Section 6.3.4  ------
If either:

    * the target host is not a valid host name, or
    * the port argument is neither equal to 80, nor equal to 443, nor 
greater than or equal to 1024 and less than or equal to 65535,

...then the UA must raise a security exception.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I agree. Since the aim of  the URI injection is to get an echo of a 
valid header it is important that the server response include illegal 
URI components that a server would not otherwise send. Newline could be 
part of a legitimate response from a confused server or one that echos 
commands automatically, eg:

tcp = new 
TCPConnection('<A HREF="http://mail.domain.ext/Upgrade:TCPConnection/1.0'">http://mail.domain.ext/Upgrade:TCPConnection/1.0'</A> )

server&gt;&gt;
Upgrade:TCPConnection/1.0
Error: Unrecognized command.

Unlike my previous example this is a perfectly valid URI. Whatever the 
magic ends up being it should aim to include illegal URI characters, ie: 
angle-brackets, white-space, control characters, etc.. in an arrangement 
that couldn't happen accidentally or through clever tricks. ie:

Magic: &lt;tcp allow&gt;\r\n

This example magic includes at least three characters that cannot be 
sent in a valid URI (space, left angle bracket, right angle-bracket) in 
addition to the newline and carriage returns.


&gt;&gt;<i> One last thing. Does anybody know how async communication would affect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common proxies (forward and reverse)? I imagine they can handle large 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amounts of POST data but how do they feel about a forcibly held-open 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by-directional communication that never calls POST or GET?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's basically what TLS is, right? The simple solution would be to just 
</I>&gt;<i> tunnel everything through TLS when you hit an uncooperative proxy.

Not with a few lines of perl you don't.
