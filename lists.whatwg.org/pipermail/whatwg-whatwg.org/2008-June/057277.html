<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently implementing more of &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; (in Opera) and
will probably have quite a lot of questions/comments during the coming
months. If this is not the best place for such discussion, please point
out where I need to be.

Today's issue:

The name of the buffered/bufferedBytes attributes imply that these
ranges are buffered on disk or in memory, so that they will not have to
be re-downloaded. However, the description reads &quot;the ranges of the
media resource, if any, that the user agent has downloaded, at the time
the attribute is evaluated.&quot;

This is not the same things, as we will not be able to buffer large
files on memory-limited devices. Instead, we might only buffer 1 MB of
data around the current playback point, or some other scheme.

I would suggest that buffered/bufferedBytes be taken to mean exactly
what they sound like by changing the description to something like:
(differences marked *like this*)

The buffered attribute must return a static normalized TimeRanges object
that represents the ranges of the media resource, if any, that the user
agent has *buffered*, at the time the attribute is evaluated.

Note: Typically this will be a single range anchored at the zero point,
but if, e.g. the user agent uses HTTP range requests in response to
seeking, then there could be multiple ranges. *There is no guarantee
that all buffered ranges will remain buffered, due to storage/memory
constraints or other reasons.*

The intention is that only ranges which are actually internally buffered
should be exposed in the buffered/bufferedBytes ranges, whereas the
current phrasing implies that all ranges which have at some point been
downloaded/buffered should be included.

Admittedly, this makes the attributes useless for determining how much
of the resource has been downloaded, but if this is needed I might
suggest the attributes downloaded/downloadedBytes instead. The
usefulness of the buffered attribute (in my current interpretation) is
not obvious to me at all, I would appreciate some use cases if possible.
