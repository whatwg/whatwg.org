I agree, but what I was using an html document for - when using JS 
innerHTML it has closing tags so the only issue would be tags that html 
itself does not close (e.g. br) but those are not applicable with a 
WebVTT cue - which is only suppose to support a very small number of 
tags, all which have closing tags.

The problem is WebVTT does not require tags be closed in a cue, e.g.

04:05.000 --&gt; 04:07.250
&lt;c.foo&gt;This is a cue.

That's allowed in WebVTT

I convert c.foo into

&lt;span class=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;This is a cue.

and when I add that to the html document and use innerHTML it then has 
the closing &lt;/span&gt; on it.

While it seems to work with some html entities, it breaks with others 
like &#160;

So for now I have to just make sure all my WebVTT are closed and not use 
the hack that adds closing tags - but since WebVTT cues do not have to 
have closing tags, but the cues need to work in XML documents, a 
built-in parser in JS that can add missing closing tags I think would be 
a good thing.


&gt;<i> And if XML and HTML is giving you issues then use JSON instead.
</I>&gt;<i> I did not see JSON mentioned in the W3C spec though.
</I>
I think the JSON in WebVTT cues is not spec but some are using it.

Basically the textrack API seems to allow almost any string, it really 
has to as WebVTT is not static and the spec changes. I wouldn't mind 
JSON being added to WebVTT as it would be a handy way to encode metadata 
about the media but that's another topic.

A built in JS HTML parser may also be of benefit in preventing code 
injection, e.g. stripping out tags from a WebVTT cue that a website does 
not allow.

The TextTrack API doesn't filter out things like script or other tags 
that aren't part of WebVTT which means any site that allows users to 
upload WebVTT files is creating a potential code injection vulnerability.

Server-side code should filter it on upload, but it would be nice to 
*someday* be able to pass a string through a native JS filter much the 
same way we can with htmltidy server-side and remove all but 
white-listed tags and attributes and get back a cleaned string with all 
tags closed.

It looks like Google has a library that does that but it isn't intended 
for client-side JS and may not be fast enough for things like phones to 
process time-sensitive cues (I don't know).

I might be wrong but it looked like the google library I found was 
intended for server-side Node.js use.
