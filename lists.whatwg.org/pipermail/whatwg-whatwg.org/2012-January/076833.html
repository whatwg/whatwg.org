<PRE>Hey Ian,

&quot;What kind of app are you considering that needs 700MB at once?&quot;

I'm considering videogames that the user would like to play offline (plane
flight, subway, etc), as well as massive software packages like Adobe CS.
A good application designer would allow the user to choose portions of the
app that they would like to cache long-term, but suppose the user needs the
entire thing?  In that case, 700MB could likely lowballing by quite a bit.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems simple, almost superfluous, but it is of staggering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; importance. An &quot;online only&quot; stigma is of greatly growing impedance to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the web platform's reputation as a software platform, and it persists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; among the vast majority of users.  The latest versions of all major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsers will support features like DOM Storage and Application Cache
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very soon, but these features are largely ambiguous, even amongst the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technically savvy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition to implementation of offline technologies, app authors are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently individually responsible for informing their users that an app
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be used offline. This is not an adequate solution, and a universal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notification that is UA-native would be far more effective at enhancing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awareness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because mere utilization of appcache and localStorage do not always make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an application &quot;offline capable&quot;, offering a manual flag to authors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allows a UA to complement, or override, its heuristic detections of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Web must become known as a full software platform, instead of just a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lite version of the &quot;native&quot; App Store experiences out there.  In order
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do so, its features must be more discoverable by users, and in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standardized fashion.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this is a very interesting proposition.  I would like to add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that there should also be UA-native indication to the user that an app
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can become offline-capable upon request, along with a mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requesting offline capability, and for triggering app data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronization.  The motivation being that there should be a universal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to manage the state of all offline capable apps at the browser/OS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These seem like reasonable problems to try to address. I recomend
</I>&gt;<i> approaching the browser vendors and asking if they would be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> these features. Browser vendor experience, and seeing what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> adoption these features get, is key to determining whether it's worth
</I>&gt;<i> adding this or not.
