This is only a transient problem for a few years, and a minor one at that 
-- you can always add CSS to make them work in CSS-capable browsers, and 
it doesn't matter so much if they do nohting in non-CSS browsers.


&gt;<i> So if you want to use &lt;nav&gt;, then - unless you're using it for purely 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic reasons with no idea of styling - you need to use some special 
</I>&gt;<i> trick to make old browsers recognize it or assign your styles to some 
</I>&gt;<i> logically redundant &lt;div&gt; markup that you use in addition to &lt;nav&gt;.
</I>
Old IEs need a special trick. Other browsers really don't, unless you 
consider setting the element's 'display' property a &quot;trick&quot;.


&gt;<i> Therefore, it would be much simpler, for compatibility with existing 
</I>&gt;<i> user agents, to use just &lt;div type=nav&gt; and &lt;div type=footer&gt;.
</I>
I think the ugliness of that solution far outweighs any temporary 
transition issue.


&gt;<i> I understand that this should have been suggested years ago. But I 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't think of the issue, and it seems that neither did anyone else, 
</I>&gt;<i> aloud.
</I>
Actually this topic was discussed in depth.


&gt;<i> Nobody needs new elements with no required functionality, really. The idea of
</I>&gt;<i> more compact markup is pointless.
</I>
This view is not shared by all. Personally, for example, I find the 
terseness of different element names to be of much help in writing more 
maintainable documents.

Specific elements have specific purposes, e.g. &lt;nav&gt; allows ATs to jump to 
or past site navigation blocks, and &lt;section&gt; allows table of contents 
outlines to be created (as do h1-h6, but section allows you to do it 
without having to renumber all your headings when moving stuff around).

But in general, the main purpose is easier authoring.
