The use case is that you want to serve the same image (same content) to all
users, but you want to serve it in different resolutions depending on their
context to avoid wasting bandwidth and killing performance (especially on
mobile devices where performance is key - you don't want to download a
1000px-wide image when you're scaling it down to 320px wide to display it).

Karl's example is on dangerous ground, IMO. The different sizes of the
image could be slightly cropped/zoomed as appropriate, but should still
clearly represent the same thing - in other words, the same alt text should
correctly describe all of them.

I agree: this needs to be done in markup, not on the server with headers.
Not that users resize their browsers all that much (except orientation
changes on phones and tablets). But, yeah.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're right - all pixels are not equal. The solution I'm going to propose
involves media queries, so things like device-pixel-ratio can be used to
address that issue.

I'm proposing this (adapted from Bruce Lawson's &lt;picture&gt; idea, and similar
to how the &lt;video&gt; element works):

&lt;adaptiveimg&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;sweater-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blue v-neck sweater in soft wool&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;sweater-medium.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 300px) and
(max-width: 450px)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;sweater-large.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 451px) and
(max-width: 600px)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;sweater-huge.jpg&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 601px)&quot;&gt;
&lt;/adaptiveimg&gt;

Yep, another new element: &lt;adaptiveimg&gt;. It doesn't have any attributes of
its own (except the standard ones). It must contain one &lt;img&gt; element,
which the author will furnish with an alt attribute and whatever else as
normal. It then contains one or more &lt;source&gt; elements, each with a media
attribute containing a valid media query.

The user agent should cycle through each &lt;source&gt; element in order,
updating the src of the &lt;img&gt; accordingly if the media query is matched. If
there are no &lt;source&gt; elements, or none of the media queries are matched,
the original src on the &lt;img&gt; is used. Only after this logic has completed
should the HTTP request for the image file take place (so there are no
wasted downloads). The media queries I've used in the example are very
simple, using just min-width and max-width, but in reality authors would
often include other things such as device-pixel-ratio and color/monochrome.

Non-supporting UAs would simply ignore the new elements and render the
&lt;img&gt; as normal, but the structure would allow authors to implement a
JavaScript polyfill if desired.

To be clear, all the &lt;source&gt;s should point to different sizes of the same
image &#8212; otherwise the content is being changed, which isn't what we're
looking to do here. In other words, the same alt attribute should correctly
describe all the &lt;source&gt;s.

I'm sure there's a lot I haven't thought of, but hopefully this is a good
start. Thoughts?
