</I>&gt;<i> an &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; autocompletetype=&quot;email&quot;&gt; field.
</I>
Orthogonality of validation and autofill sounds nice, but is it useful in  
practice?

The only use case I can think of for a field autocompleted like an e-mail  
field, but not validated like an e-mail field would be login form with a  
username field that accepts either username or e-mail.

However, login forms are better served by login-specific autofill that is  
in current browsers (saving opaque login field and password field  
together), since you don't want to enter arbitrary e-mail address from  
your addressbook, but a specific e-mail/login and a matching password at  
the same time.

Are there any other cases where you'd like field that is autocompleted,  
but doesn't otherwise behave like the autocompleted type?


But even if single-mixed-login-field autocomplete was desired, then  
perhaps a mixed type would work too:

  &lt;input type=&quot;username email&quot;&gt;

It could be defined to mean that either of the two types is accepted, and  
autocomplete works for both.


Also orthogonal type and autocompletetype allows nonsense combinations  
like &lt;input type=number autocompletetype=email&gt;, while a precise type  
attribute would ensure that rendering and autocomplete always make sense  
together.


&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;tel&quot;&gt; is actually a little more subtle, in that it is
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguous between what type of phone number is expected: a regular phone
</I>&gt;<i> number, a fax number, etc.?
</I>
Which is why I've suggested extending type attribute to take a token list:  
&lt;input type=&quot;tel fax&quot;&gt;

(my expected rendering for this field would be &quot;[ are you serious? fax in  
the 21st century!? ]&quot; ;)

&gt;<i>  Briefly, I think the type attribute is designed to describe slightly
</I>&gt;<i> broader types, just detailed enough to enable user agents to properly
</I>&gt;<i> render or format or validate form fields and their data.  The
</I>&gt;<i> autocompletetype attribute, on the other hand, tries to achieve a higher
</I>&gt;<i> level of precision.  I anticipate that merging these two use cases into a
</I>&gt;<i> single attribute is undesirable, but I'd love to hear from those more
</I>&gt;<i> deeply familiar with the design decisions behind the type attribute.
</I>
In the thread you've pointed to I saw suggestion to make registration of  
new types open for anybody, and that could cause difficulty introducing  
new kids of validation/UI under names formerly used only for autocomplete.

How about merging autocompletetype with autocomplete then?

It looks sensible to me:

&lt;input autocomplete=off&gt; &lt;input autocomplete=email&gt;

In case of &lt;form autocomplete=off&gt;&lt;input autocomplete=email&gt;&lt;/form&gt; I'd  
expect autocomplete=email to override form's &quot;off&quot; value.

&gt;&gt;<i> Having all of type, autocomplete and autocompletetype looks quite messy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One small saving grace here: Since autocomplete defaults to &quot;on&quot;, it  
</I>&gt;<i> should be rare to need to specify both autocomplete and autocompletetype.
</I>
I can't imagine usefulness of this:

&lt;input autocomplete=off autocompletetype=email&gt;

and if that case is left out, then I don't see a reason to keep both  
attributes.


I really like the idea of more specific autocomplete types and use of list  
of tokens for this, but the proposed attribute in its current form is  
overlapping/conflicting with existing attributes, and even the name  
'autocompletetype' itself gives me an impression of a forced extension,  
rather than integral part of the language.
