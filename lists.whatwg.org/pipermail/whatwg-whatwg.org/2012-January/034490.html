You can do adaptive sites using media queries.

   &lt;!-- HTML --&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;My Site&lt;/h1&gt;

   // CSS
   @media (min-width: 320px and max-width: 640px) {
     h1::before { content: url(<A HREF="http://cdn.url.com/img/myimage_xs.jpg">http://cdn.url.com/img/myimage_xs.jpg</A>) }
   }
   @media (min-width: 640px and max-width: 1024px) {
     h1::before { content: url(<A HREF="http://cdn.url.com/img/myimage_m.jpg">http://cdn.url.com/img/myimage_m.jpg</A>) }
   }
   @media (min-width: 1024px) {
     h1::before { content: url(<A HREF="http://cdn.url.com/img/myimage_xsl.jpg">http://cdn.url.com/img/myimage_xsl.jpg</A>) }
   }

What's the use case for doing it for images in &lt;img&gt; elements? Typically 
&lt;img&gt; elements are for content images, where you don't usually want to 
adapt anything.

</I>
I don't understand the use case. For something like a user profile icon 
surely it would be rather bad UI to use a different icon on different 
devices. I presume you don't mean a profile icon though, since 1024x250 is 
a bit excessive for an icon these days, and I'm not aware of any site that 
lets users pick different icons for different size contexts.

I don't think that really works. You wouldn't want to get different 
results if I started with a small window vs starting with a big window and 
narrowing it. It should adapt in realtime.

Note that &quot;resolution&quot; and &quot;number of pixels on the screen&quot; are orthogonal 
issues. Also, note that the number of pixels on the screen is irrelevant, 
it's the number of pixels on the viewport that matters.

My phone has a far higher resolution than my TV, but has the same number 
of pixels. My phone also has a higher resolution than my desktop, but 
windows on my desktop typically have far more pixels.

</I>
I don't really understand the use case here. Could you elaborate, ideally 
with an example showing the alternative text you had in mind?
