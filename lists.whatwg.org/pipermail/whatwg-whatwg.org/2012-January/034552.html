These seem like reasonable problems to try to address. I recomend 
approaching the browser vendors and asking if they would be interested in 
these features. Browser vendor experience, and seeing what kind of 
adoption these features get, is key to determining whether it's worth 
adding this or not.

What kind of app are you considering that needs 700MB at once?

For such apps I would recommend using the appcache feature and structuring 
the app so that it doesn't need to be fully cached before it'll work.
