</I>&gt;<i> added to the initial proposal because a nontrivial number of existing forms

</I>&gt;<i> specifically for discussion of the specific choice of tokens, so that this
</I>&gt;<i> thread can remain focused on the more high-level details of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the address lines, I don't think it's practical to encourage authors to
</I>&gt;<i> use a textarea rather than separate fields.  To the best of my knowledge,
</I>&gt;<i> almost no website currently uses textareas for this purpose, so textareas
</I>&gt;<i> are only a theoretical best practice -- users and developers both tend to

</I>&gt;<i> from separate fields to a single textarea would require backend migrations
</I>&gt;<i> (in the parsing code, the database, or both) in order to store the data
</I>&gt;<i> entered in this new format.  That would negate one of the key advantages of
</I>&gt;<i> this proposal, i.e. the lack of need for backend migrations, relative to
</I>&gt;<i> ECML.
</I>

I don't see how requiring forms to lump the address together is going to
help -- if the database stores the fields separately, other APIs that the
backend needs to give the address to (such as shipping carriers, address
cleanup/geocoding, etc) expects separate fields then all you are doing is
pushing the parsing of the address off to the backend rather than letting
the user see it.  Also, I think a properly localized (ie, fields dependent
on the country given) address form is much more likely to get the correct
data from the user than just asking them to enter a blob of text.

One question -- how does this fit with, say, a &lt;select&gt; element for country
that shows localized country names?  Can it be &quot;autocompleted&quot; as well?  If
so, does it match on the localized names, the value (which might be an ISO
2 or 3-digit code, or something unique to the app), or what?
