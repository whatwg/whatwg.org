</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the intent is to help authors to avoid pitfalls, it would suffice to

</I>&gt;<i> or just explicitly define the meaning by saying that the time of

</I>
That's what conformance errors are.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There's a fundamental compatibility issue with&lt;style scoped&gt;. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Existing browsers simply ignore the scoped attribute and apply the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; styles to the entire document. This is surely not what an author 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; means when he uses &lt;style scoped&gt; as per HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's trivial to work around that using ID selectors in the interim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid few things if any are trivial when playing with selectors in 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS. For one thing, ID selectors have drastic effect on specificity. 
</I>&gt;<i> More fundamentally, if you want to use a piece of a document in another 
</I>&gt;<i> and copy part or all of the original style sheet, it shouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to modify the style sheet by throwing in ID selectors at 
</I>&gt;<i> different places.
</I>
Sure, that's why we're adding the feature. The ID thing is just a 
temporary inconvenience while we are in the transition.


&gt;<i> The compatibility issue is rather serious when an author using a new 
</I>&gt;<i> construct strictly the way it has been defined (and gets no complaint 
</I>&gt;<i> from a validator) sees _all_ existing browsers do something global when 
</I>&gt;<i> it was specifically defined to apply to a small part only.
</I>
In practice, authors test with browsers long before they test with a 
validator, so the validator part of this isn't really relevant.

Authors are generally quite familiar with the concept of graceful fallback 
and how to make things work in legacy UAs. I don't think there's any 
serious trouble here. There is a workaround that's trivial to implement, 
as described above.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Suggestion: Drop&lt;style scoped&gt;. Instead, introduce a new attribute, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; say styleref, which is permitted for elements that allow flow 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; content, or for any element (whichever is easier). The attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would specify a space-separated list of CSS stylesheet URLs, to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; applied inside the element.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That wouldn't solve the main use case: syndication. In that scenario, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; referencing external files is often a non-starter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An external CSS file can do anything an embedded one can, but if the 
</I>&gt;<i> pragmatic issue is that too many separate files would be needed, then we 
</I>&gt;<i> could define a new media type for &quot;scoped style sheet&quot; and use
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;style type=&quot;text/css-scoped&quot;&gt;...&lt;/style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Existing user agents would ignore the elements, which is probably better 
</I>&gt;<i> than misapplying them (globally). Admittedly, this is somewhat hackish, 
</I>&gt;<i> since media types and their parameters are supposed to describe the 
</I>&gt;<i> data, not its usage, but this wouldn't be the first or worst deviation 
</I>&gt;<i> from that principle.
</I>
Indeed. A scoped=&quot;&quot; attribute does the same thing but better -- it can be 
made to work in legacy UAs, and doesn't do anything hackish with MIME 
types.


&gt;<i> &gt; A system that cannot do this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;/head&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but can do this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;/head&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seems artificially limited and really should just be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's still a reality in which many people live, with no way to fix it.
</I>
Can you elaborate on which systems you are referring to?


&gt;<i> But unless I'm missing something, the current version allows the old 
</I>&gt;<i> method of starting &lt;body&gt; with &lt;style&gt;, just provided that you write 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;style scoped&gt;. It would not matter whether browsers recognize the 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute scoped or not, as the scope would be the entire document, 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't it?
</I>
Sure.


&gt;<i> Well what _am_ I missing now, when testing with validator.w3.org, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt;&lt;style scoped&gt; causes this: [...]
</I>
Please file validator bugs with the validators.


&gt;<i> &gt; If you can only affect some parts of the&lt;body&gt;, the site probably 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would also rather you didn't affect parts outside those parts by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fiddling with them via CSS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe. Maybe nobody thought of it. Maybe it's just a limitation caused 
</I>&gt;<i> by technicalities. Anyway, when I _can_ fiddle with presentation using 
</I>&gt;<i> the style=&quot;...&quot; attribute or with presentational markup, formally 
</I>&gt;<i> disallowing &lt;style&gt; doesn't help anyone.
</I>
On the contrary, I think it makes maintenance a lot easier by pushing 
authors towards a better authoring style.
