</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The goal of Exhibit is to make it easy for non-programmers to embed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interactive data visualizations in their web pages.
</I>&gt;<i> HTML has a number of features intended for such things. The class
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, for example, could be used to flag a table as something that
</I>&gt;<i> should get a graph:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;table class=&quot;graph-me&quot;&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specific annotations for the graphing script can be included in data-*=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attributes; for example, this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;table class=&quot;graph-me&quot; data-graphs-type=&quot;xy&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;thead&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;th data-graphs-series-kind=&quot;x time-series&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;th data-graphs-series-kind=&quot;y log&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...might be how you mark up the top of a table that's going to be drawn as
</I>&gt;<i> an X-Y plot with a time-based x axis and a logarithmic y axis.
</I>yes, this is exactly how we do it, currently using an ex: prefix on the 
attributes to make sure we don't collide with anything else
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can use&lt;meta&gt;  to include page-wide information. You can link to other
</I>&gt;<i> resources using&lt;link rel&gt;  or&lt;a rel&gt;. You can embed raw data using
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script type&gt;, for example, assuming the type was registered:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;script type=&quot;text/graph-data&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      { type: 'xy', x: 'time-series', y: 'log',
</I>&gt;<i>        data: [...] }
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the data structure is more like nested name-value lists than tabular,
</I>&gt;<i> you could use microdata to mark it up, with the script then using the
</I>&gt;<i> microdata DOM API to present the data.
</I>again, this is in fact what we do (both link and embed methods).  but 
these aren't the parts that we are struggling to address properly via html5
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, there are a huge number of ways to approach this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are also working on further options. The component work in the Web Apps
</I>&gt;<i> working group is developing mechanisms for encapsulating widget
</I>&gt;<i> definitions, so that your script could bind directly to the data in the
</I>&gt;<i> page. This same work will likely involve introducing author-extensible CSS
</I>&gt;<i> properties for styling purposes, as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another approach would be to use the catchall html5 data- prefix for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attributes.  We could certainly prefix all of our specialized attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the data- prefix, which would turn those attributes valid for html.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This solution is unsatisfactory for two reasons.  The first is that our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attributes are not data attributes----we are not using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microformat-oriented data attributes; rather, we are using attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that describe visualizations. data- seems a poor choice of prefix.
</I>&gt;<i> Treat the five characters &quot;data-&quot; as an opaque string. data-* attributes
</I>&gt;<i> are for use by scripts for any purposes that the script wants.
</I>Perhaps this is hair-splitting, but I agree completely if we are talking 
about a script running and, for example, binding temporary data to a 
particular node.

However, in our use case, it is in a sense &quot;coincidence&quot; that our tags 
are being examined by a script.  The _purpose_ of our tags is to provide 
the same kind of semantic structuring as &lt;img&gt; or &lt;author&gt; or &lt;navbar&gt; 
tags: specifying that certain elements, such as a map or a facet, should 
appear on the page.  It is conceivable that there might be several 
different scripts, and perhaps some native extensions, that are all able 
to interpret these tags and do something useful with them on the page.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I would recommend against putting presentational information in
</I>&gt;<i> the markup -- whether you use XML namespaces, data-* attributes, or
</I>&gt;<i> non-conforming attributes of your own invention. The right place for
</I>&gt;<i> styling information is CSS. On the long run, as mentioned above, I expect
</I>&gt;<i> we'll provide explicit hooks in CSS for authors to put custom style
</I>&gt;<i> information for this purpose (the equivalent of data-* attributes but for
</I>&gt;<i> properties). Unfortunately we're not there yet.
</I>I don't think of &lt;map&gt; as presentational information, any more than I 
think of &lt;img&gt;.  I agree that certain _attributes_ of the map, such as 
marker colors, should ultimately be put in css.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second problem that concerns me is attribute collisions.  If we use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an attribute like data-role=&quot;view&quot;, how long will it be before an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exhibit author runs into a situation where a different javascript
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library is using the same data-role attribute for a different purpose,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which would make the two libraries incompatible with one another?
</I>&gt;<i> Just use the format data-exhibit-foo=&quot;&quot;.
</I>Yes, and what happens when someone else decides that exhibit is a neat 
name and they want to use it too?  This is the biggest problem I see. 
I'd be happy to use any technical solution, and find it worrisome that 
instead the spec is relying on a &quot;good behavior&quot; solution.

I could hack it myself, by putting a namespace argument to the script 
&lt;script src=&quot;script.js?namespace=exhibit&quot;&gt; that would tell the script to 
look for tags prefixed with the given namespace.  That way someone 
encountering a collision could change the namespace.  But it seems a 
horrible hack to implement this script by script.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no specific loyalty to namespaces, but I am really hopeful that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> html5 will offer us a solution that reflects the issues I outlined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above, namely:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * allow extension of them html5 vocabulary with attributes Exhibit will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use to anchor visualizations,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * such that the resulting html will validate,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * without requiring rigid obedience to the challenging html polyglot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> syntax, which is beyond the capabilities of our target novice web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * and protecting us from a future in which collisions on choice of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute names make our library/vocabulary incompatible with others'
</I>&gt;<i> That's what data-library-name=&quot;value&quot; attributes are for. They exactly fit
</I>&gt;<i> the described requirements.
</I>I agree that they technically solve the first three, although I'm 
skeptical that was the original intent (if the data- prefix just means 
&quot;anything we want to add outside the html spec&quot; then why not just allow 
any tag, without a prefix, which accomplishes the same thing?).  I 
disagree about bullet 4; I don't think relying on people to politely 
avoid choosing the same library name is an effective long-term solution.
