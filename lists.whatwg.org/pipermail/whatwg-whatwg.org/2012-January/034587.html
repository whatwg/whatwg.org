</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been trying to optimise my site (as a test case) for mobile usage 
</I>&gt;<i> and one area where I found issues was with the media queries used to 
</I>&gt;<i> link CSS files. I noticed that despite each &lt;link&gt; tag including the 
</I>&gt;<i> maximum and minimum screen widths (which is about the minimum that is 
</I>&gt;<i> supported across every majority browser) the browsers (IE, Opera, 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox, Chrome) all seemed to download every CSS file. These days, when 
</I>&gt;<i> it's recommended to use sprites to reduce bandwidth on multiple images, 
</I>&gt;<i> it seems crazy that there's no contingency to reduce bandwidth on CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> files that the browser should know it doesn't need. Is there a 
</I>&gt;<i> particular reason for this? I can understand for devices like a tablet 
</I>&gt;<i> where the orientation is expected to change often and it might want to 
</I>&gt;<i> download multiple CSS files to reduce the latency that downloading as 
</I>&gt;<i> required would bring, but that doesn't explain why a desktop browser 
</I>&gt;<i> would still need to grab CSS that is clearly labelled as being for a 
</I>&gt;<i> maximum screen width of 300px.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From a usage point of view, I wouldn't be too unhappy at having my 
</I>&gt;<i> browser download extra CSS found in a media queried &lt;link&gt; if I decide 
</I>&gt;<i> to resize my browser, as that is not what I'd call typical browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, but I would expect a tablet or mobile to be more responsive as 
</I>&gt;<i> they are types of devices that are prone to be moved around and tilted.

</I>&gt;<i> The reason for this is so that, if the document width later changes such 
</I>&gt;<i> that one of the excluded stylesheets is now valid, we don't want to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a noticeable delay while we fire off a network request and retrieve the 
</I>&gt;<i> new stylesheet.  Remember that widths refer to the browser window, not 
</I>&gt;<i> the monitor, so small widths *can* (and do) occur on desktop browsers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This delay is potentially bad for usability, but more importantly, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> bad for scripts, as there's a substantial window in which a &lt;link&gt;'s 
</I>&gt;<i> media query resolves to true, but it either doesn't have an associated 
</I>&gt;<i> Stylesheet object, or the Stylesheet is a &quot;dummy&quot; that doesn't yet 
</I>&gt;<i> contain the real values.  Stylesheet access is synchronous, so we'd have 
</I>&gt;<i> to block the entire JS thread while waiting for it to come in.

</I>&gt;<i> There are several separate problems here.  Below I focus on the Gecko 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, which is what I'm familiar with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, the code was written originally before mobile started 
</I>&gt;<i> being a concern.  And in the desktop space, there are very few media 
</I>&gt;<i> queries which are guaranteed to never match.  For example, the size of 
</I>&gt;<i> the CSS viewport is not fixed on desktop.  Furthermore, until the recent 
</I>&gt;<i> media query implementation all that you could filter on was the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> medium, and in the common cases you wanted to download both the print 
</I>&gt;<i> and screen sheets and other media were unused.  So there wasn't much 
</I>&gt;<i> need to optimize away stylesheets whose media queries did not match.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, there is a slight problem of spec collision.  While sheets whose 
</I>&gt;<i> media queries do not match should not affect rendering, there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> provisions for not exposing their object model, which of course requires 
</I>&gt;<i> downloading the stylesheet.  I agree it might be good to add such 
</I>&gt;<i> provisions, because there are some media queries we really _do_ know 
</I>&gt;<i> statically will never match in Gecko.  They're just a much smaller set 
</I>&gt;<i> than most people think.  And of course there may be page compat 
</I>&gt;<i> concerns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Screen widths in media queries are in CSS pixels, not in device pixels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are operating system settings, that can even be changed 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically, that change the screen width in CSS pixels.  There are even 
</I>&gt;<i> browser settings that change the screen width in CSS pixels.  Try this 
</I>&gt;<i> in Firefox:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;alert(window.screen.width)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>          value=&quot;click me&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Load that page, click the button, zoom in as much as you can using the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser's zoom function, and click the button again.  Over here, the two 
</I>&gt;<i> alerts show 1920 and 640 respectively.
</I>
I haven't changed the HTML specification in response to the above. It 
isn't clear to me what we should do, if anything.
