</I>This is of no use to content images - which are the real problem. CSS
supplied images are not an issue.

Sorry, you couldn't be more wrong. Content images need to adapt because of
the performance problems with mobile. Huge effort has been expended in the
community to answer this problem - mobiles should not be delivered the same
sized images as desktop, even though the semantic value of the images are
the same. What we are talking here is device-appropriate re-scaled versions
of the same image. This saves bandwidth and allows phones with weak
hardware to perform acceptably. For more on the issue please read

With retina displays, don't be surprised to see icons around this size very
soon.

</I>
By re-requesting image resources after re-scale? That's not performant. But
I do agree that it'd be nicer to getreal-time resource re-requests, if only
the penalty didn't involve page layout jumps. The fact os, it's rare anyone
resizes the browser. The adaptive image agenda is mostly about supporting
massively differing viewport sizes and device configurations. Dynamic
rescaling is a side-agenda.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but the point is, the alternative images you may want to display

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes and no. It depends on how the image request happens. For example, AI
(linked above) cares only about the number of pixels on the screen. Why?
Because given HTML at the moment you can't re-request an image when you
grow the window - meaning if you start with a small viewport and AI only
went by the viewport size, you'd get a small image cached on your device.
As soon as you grew the window the imag ewould be too small and there's no
way to know the cached version is no longer fit for purpose &amp; re-request.

</I>&gt;<i> windows on my desktop typically have far more pixels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ergo, you lose the accessibility because you now can't textually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; represent it in the alt tag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really understand the use case here. Could you elaborate, ideally
