<PRE>Sounds like what you want is flex box. Have you looked at that yet?

&gt;<i> As I understand it, the main reason for rejecting &lt;di&gt; was that it
</I>&gt;<i> solves a problem that is allegedly CSS's job, but as an author who
</I>&gt;<i> uses &lt;dl&gt;s quite extensively, adding a grouping element would really
</I>&gt;<i> make my life a lot easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, my most common problem with &lt;dl&gt;s is styling them, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> hardly CSS's fault. What kind of styling am I attempting to do?
</I>&gt;<i> Mostly, to arrange them in columns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not use &lt;table&gt;? Because the data is at most two-dimensional
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., serial, not tabular) and consists of definitions rather than
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary data. Why would I want to to arrange the data in this way?
</I>&gt;<i> The same reason I would want to arrange most things in columns: to use
</I>&gt;<i> vertical space efficiently when I have it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried, and as far as I can tell, this can't be achieved with
</I>&gt;<i> floats. Even if it can, it's prohibitively unintuitive enough to
</I>&gt;<i> someone with considerable CSS experience. The only way I have done it
</I>&gt;<i> is with absolute positioning, which of course takes you out of normal
</I>&gt;<i> flow and into fixed coordinate positioning; hardly tenable considering
</I>&gt;<i> the flexibility requirements of fluid, and now responsive designs.
</I>&gt;<i> Even recent additions like CSS3 columns are a blunt instrument in this
</I>&gt;<i> regard, which often result in widows/orphans unless height is
</I>&gt;<i> manipulated manually to force everything into place (a nonstarter for
</I>&gt;<i> separation of concerns).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, I can achieve this easily with &lt;ul&gt;s and with &lt;table&gt;s, with
</I>&gt;<i> headings and paragraphs inside of various containers; I can do it with
</I>&gt;<i> essentially every other data structure but &lt;dl&gt;, and that's no
</I>&gt;<i> coincidence: &lt;dl&gt;s are notoriously hard to style specifically because
</I>&gt;<i> they're loosely-structured; they lack the grouping semantics which are
</I>&gt;<i> paradoxically abundant in other content models. Because of this, I
</I>&gt;<i> have in the past resorted to either: A.) choosing a
</I>&gt;<i> less-semantically-accurate, but more flexible structure; or B.)
</I>&gt;<i> splitting the &lt;dl&gt; into two &lt;dl&gt;s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tend to opt for B. simply because I want to retain the &lt;dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> semantics, but it's still less-than-desirable because the motivation
</I>&gt;<i> for doing so is purely presentational. Sibling &lt;dl&gt;s are as silly as
</I>&gt;<i> sibling &lt;ul&gt;/&lt;ol&gt;s: if there's no reason to have other content between
</I>&gt;<i> them (such as an explanation about what the second list represents),
</I>&gt;<i> there's no reason not to enumerate them all in the same list. Yet,
</I>&gt;<i> it's the only practical way to achieve this effect. I have a feeling
</I>&gt;<i> most authors would opt for A., however, which diminishes the utility
</I>&gt;<i> of &lt;dl&gt; by making it even more rarely used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The way I see it, &lt;di&gt; has more or less identical use cases to
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;. Despite the fact that we have an outlining algorithm that
</I>&gt;<i> will automatically determine the structure of your content without
</I>&gt;<i> using &lt;section&gt; at all, authors are still free to use grouping
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to make sectioning explicit, which is necessary to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity. Take this for example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;h3&gt;foo&lt;/h3&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;h3&gt;baz&lt;/h3&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;p&gt;qux&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;quux&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230;where the absence of &lt;section&gt;s would result in two titled sections,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than the desired: three sections, two of which are titled and
</I>&gt;<i> one of which is untitled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is in no way different from the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;di&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;dt&gt;foo&lt;/dt&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;dd&gt;bar&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/di&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;di&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;dt&gt;baz&lt;/dt&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;dd&gt;qux&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/di&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dd&gt;quux&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230;where the absence of &lt;di&gt;s would result in two named values, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the desired: three values, two of which are named and one of
</I>&gt;<i> which is unnamed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Simply put: just because the parsing algorithm is well-defined and we
</I>&gt;<i> can imply association sans-container, that doesn't mean authors (like
</I>&gt;<i> myself) won't want finer-grained control over grouping.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a compelling reason why, given the current &lt;dl&gt; content
</I>&gt;<i> model, it is possible to create a list of: nothing but unnamed values,
</I>&gt;<i> nothing but valueless names, an unnamed value followed by a named
</I>&gt;<i> value, a named value followed by a valueless name, but NOT a named
</I>&gt;<i> value followed by an unnamed value&#8212;what makes that last scenario any
</I>&gt;<i> less useful than all of the others? If anything it's probably the
</I>&gt;<i> *most* useful, since valueless names and nameless values can already
</I>&gt;<i> be represented by &lt;ul&gt;/&lt;ol&gt;.
