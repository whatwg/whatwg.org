What are examples of when you want this behavior, that aren't handled
as easily with the current spec?

&gt;<i> In order to get the wrapping behavior, we should add a new command, e.g.

What are some examples of things Closure needs to do with blockquotes
that aren't easily supported by the current spec?  (indent/outdent is
intended to be the way to change blockquote level, not formatBlock.)

&gt;<i> Having both commands and having them both be simple in what they do lets

</I>
That's debatable.  In any event, I'd like to hear concrete use-cases
before changing the spec.  Real-world experience is valuable, but it's
also often based on having to work around browser bugs, which isn't as
important when writing a spec.  E.g., if you're using formatBlock to
handle blockquote because some browsers don't support indent/outdent
the way you want, but indent/outdent as specced will work fine for
your use-case, that's not a reason to change the spec.
