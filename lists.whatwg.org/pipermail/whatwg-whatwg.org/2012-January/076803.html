I think of the distinction here as follows:

Imagine the various values forms might want.  For example, first name, last
name, home address, work address, home phone, mobile phone, fax.

Now classify these by kind.  (For an object-oriented programmer like me,
this would be &quot;enumerate the different classes/types required to hold the
above values&quot;.)  You might come up with &quot;name&quot;, &quot;address&quot;, &quot;phone number&quot;.
 All phone numbers share some set of properties, such as consisting of
digits, as do all names, all addresses, etc.

The distinction between what kind of a value something is and what precise
instance of that kind it is is a valuable distinction.  As you noted
already, the former can be used to do structural validation or provide
helpful UI for entry without needing to understand the latter.

I see &quot;type&quot; versus &quot;autocompletetype&quot; in this same way.  &quot;type&quot; allows the
UA to understand the structure of a form value while &quot;autocompletetype&quot;
allows it to understand which particular values might commonly go there.
 Certainly we could eliminate the former and just use the latter, but there
is a major downside.

Imagine my UA has support for all the above example specific types I gave.
 Now a web author wants to write a form with a new value, e.g. &quot;maiden
name&quot; or &quot;pager number&quot;.  It would be wrong to use any of the above
autocompletetype values, since this field doesn't mean any of those things.
 But that means I can't get the UA to do validation or UI assistance for me
either.

We could try to solve this by allowing our unified &quot;type&quot; attribute to take
on the union of all &quot;type&quot; and &quot;autocompletetype&quot; values.  But this is
confusing.  When I can have type &quot;phone number&quot; or &quot;home phone number&quot;,
which do I use?  It's not necessarily clear to a web author what the
practical ramifications of this choice are.

Therefore, I think leaving these fields separate makes sense even if
sometimes one could imply the &quot;type&quot; from the &quot;autocompletetype&quot;.
