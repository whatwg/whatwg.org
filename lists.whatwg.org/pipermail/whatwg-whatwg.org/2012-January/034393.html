There is no difference. It's only a matter of what you want the fallback 
to look like in older browsers.


&gt;<i> 1.1. When marking up a menu specifically with *multiple* menu items, is 
</I>&gt;<i> menu/li the only way to do it or would menu/menu also be appropriate?
</I>
Nested menus means submenus.


&gt;<i> 2. What is the difference between a menu containing command elements and 
</I>&gt;<i> a menu containing form controls? Do they merely favor future and legacy 
</I>&gt;<i> UAs respectively?
</I>
There's no difference except &lt;command&gt; doesn't show in old browsers. 
(Which might be good or might be bad depending on what you want.)


&gt;<i> 3. The spec should provide examples demonstrating when it is better to 
</I>&gt;<i> use context vs. toolbar vs. list, as these are very similar in concept. 
</I>&gt;<i> I could easily see them being misappropriated.
</I>
Well you'd use a context menu when you want a context menu, and a toolbar 
when you want a toolbar... those seem pretty clear. :-)

The &quot;list&quot; feature is just for backwards-compatibility, it's not really 
needed.


&gt;<i> 4. In the first example, what renders the button UI? Is it
</I>&gt;<i> menu[@type=toolbar]/li, or li/menu? Or is it implied CSS?
</I>
Not sure what you mean.


&gt;<i> 4.1. Furthermore, should this example even depict a button UI, given 
</I>&gt;<i> that most graphical interfaces display top-level toolbars as text/icons 
</I>&gt;<i> against a [mostly] solid background Were a UA to render the example as 
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated, would designers not have to style away the button 
</I>&gt;<i> appearance in order to achieve a look &amp; feel that matches user 
</I>&gt;<i> expectation?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, this would not be the case in &quot;secondary&quot; (or n-ary) 
</I>&gt;<i> toolbars, for instance as in word processors, where everything below the 
</I>&gt;<i> initial row are usually buttons. Could there be a way, then, whether in 
</I>&gt;<i> markup or CSS, to denote whether a toolbar is displayed as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;primary&quot;/&quot;top-level&quot; toolbar or not?
</I>
Theoretically, the styling here is expected to be done via CSS 
pseudo-elements.


&gt;<i> 5. Provide more/graphical/clearer examples, to aid both browser vendors 
</I>&gt;<i> in deciding how to implement the elements, and authors in having an idea 
</I>&gt;<i> of what result they can expect from using them. The NPC form, for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance, does not say exactly what it is or does, nor does it represent 
</I>&gt;<i> a common UI convention. The only thing I can think of that comes close 
</I>&gt;<i> is Spotlight in OS X (if I'm interpreting it correctly), which I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think I've ever seen in a [presumed] game before.
</I>
Adding items to context menus seems like a pretty well-understood 
convention; could you elaborate on why this example is confusing?


&gt;<i> 6. How is the command element rendered within a menu context when 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript is disabled? Is it meant only for non-essential actions? If 
</I>&gt;<i> it isn't, shouldn't it be able to be non-empty, so it can fallback to 
</I>&gt;<i> links or buttons? Or is the only possible fallback replicating every 
</I>&gt;<i> command with form controls that aren't direct children of the parent 
</I>&gt;<i> menu?
</I>
You can use form controls (no &lt;command&gt; at all) when you want fallback.


&gt;<i> 6.1 On that note, why is the spec enabling the use of unstyled spans to 
</I>&gt;<i> achieve alternative rendering? Doesn't this give meaning (however 
</I>&gt;<i> contextual) to an element that is supposed to be semantically neutral?
</I>
Not sure what you mean.


&gt;<i> 7. Is the menu element always to be rendered in-page or could it be 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed within the OS itself? Kroc Camen 
</I>&gt;<i> (suggests)[<A HREF="http://camendesign.com/blog/stop_this_madness">http://camendesign.com/blog/stop_this_madness</A>] the latter but 
</I>&gt;<i> at present there is nothing in the spec about such an implementation. If 
</I>&gt;<i> this is left up to the UA how will developers know how/if to style it 
</I>&gt;<i> without using browser detection?
</I>
The goal for toolbars is for them to be in-page.

Indeed.
