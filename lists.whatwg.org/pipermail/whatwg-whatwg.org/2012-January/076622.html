If true, this should be simple to fix.  But I would think that there was 
a way to detect this via the readyState or error properties.  In 
particular, if the error.code is MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED that would 
seem to be a strong indication that the format could not be played, right?

&gt;<i> Even here I have a problem. In which order does the user-agent check the
</I>&gt;<i> source files (in Chrome it seems to be in the order in which they are
</I>&gt;<i> written, but there is no guidance here in the spec.

<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#concept-media-load-algorithm">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-video-element.html#concept-media-load-algorithm</A> 
step 3 says:

   Otherwise, if the media element does not have a src attribute but has
   a source element child, then let mode be children and let candidate
   be the first such source element child in tree order.

and same section starting at &quot;Otherwise, the source elements will be 
used; run these substeps:&quot; explicitly talks about trying the &lt;source&gt; 
elements in document order.

So what Chrome is doing is exactly what the spec requires.

&gt;<i> Also will my user agent down-load the file that it cannot play, thus using
</I>&gt;<i> up band-width?
</I>
That's up to the to some extent UA, but I'd think that if you list a 
type=&quot;whatever&quot; and the UA doesn't support the type, any sane UA would 
skip the download.  Specifically, see substep 5 of the &quot;run these 
substeps&quot; section mentioned above:

   5. If candidate has a type attribute whose value, when parsed as a
   MIME type (including any codecs described by the codecs parameter,
   for types that define that parameter), represents a type that the
   user agent knows it cannot render, then end the synchronous section,
   and jump down to the failed step below.

So the only way for a UA to not skip the &lt;source&gt; is if it doesn't know 
it can't render the type.
