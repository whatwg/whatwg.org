</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And these safely systems and regulations are imposed upon drivers in

Thank you for making my point... twice... FileApi... I simply cannot 
ride that car... fine, there's no direct access to whole disc, I hate 
the idea, but I can live with that, can I at least have full access to 
directory of user's choice? No. Sockets? Can I run this car? no, I have 
to put a horse ahead to have a feeling that car is actually going 
somewhere etc, etc...
And we are not discussing forbidding people to letting themselves being 
slaves (or sell their souls), we are discussing here forbidding knife, 
because who cares how useful in might be for so many people, some people 
might get hurt by violence of others or incompetence of themselves.
No one is questioning some line being drawn somewhere, I'm discussing 
where it's being drawn...

Web technologies are the holy grail of programming language, the 
ultimate answer to eternal question: &quot;easy multiplatform language&quot;.

My dream is to actually have a high level application platform being 
able to run &quot;anywhere&quot;. Yeah, I know about Java, .NET/Mono, Object 
Pascal... I actually do write multiplatform applications in .NET/Mono, 
and Object Pascal... fine as languages, but considering the 
multiplatform feature... all pretty much a failure (do not get me wrong, 
it can be done in those platforms, but given the potential here)... 
Still I'm being drawn to this little language called ECMAScript, 
presentation/definition potentials of CSS/HTML... Imagine how much fun 
this could be with web technologies... you just run browser of your 
choice anywhere you want, you run an application of your choosing (and 
anywhere you are, always the same), you can manage your remote data,  if 
you want them remote, you can manage local data, if you want them local 
(that is the very point of everything I wrote so far)... It would be so 
easy and we are so close.... Java Applets suck it :).
Why do I need to turn on Delphi or Visual Studio to program desktop 
application? Why can't I just use web technologies within browser and 
then only wrap data interface around some store/retrieve mechanism 
(local, remote)? Well, it can be done locally, sure... all you need to 
do is install web / web socket server on local computer itself, write 
server side of that application...
Just imagine it... no platform porting, changing desktop application to 
remote application in a matter of hours, having remote servers only when 
you need them...

Web technologies are the holy grail of programming language, the 
ultimate answer to eternal question: &quot;easy multiplatform language&quot;.
