<PRE>Hi,

For &quot;what should not be auto completed&quot;, I think &quot;autocomplete=off&quot; is
sufficient.

As far as I understand, the issue comes when you want different fields to
be auto completed and only related suggestions should be shown. With the
approach mentioned in this proposal, we can easily differentiate fields.
But problem is the never ending list of field type tokens. Even the list
mentioned here looks a small subset. Is it not sufficient to have just
generic types like name, address, contact, etc? I understand user would
always like to see more specific auto complete suggestions but then it
looks hard to standardize huge list of tokens like name, surname, cc-name,
etc. and also it may not support internationalization properly.

Have you considered just having autocompletetype attribute on form?
autocompletetype=registration/private(banking, etc)/personal/login, etc.

Having such attribute attribute on form also make it easy to control what
kind of forms should be auto completed. For example, not many user would
want their banking details like cc-name,cc-exp-year to be auto completed on
a desktop browser. Probably only users with personal electronic
devices(mobile/other) would like to have banking details auto completed.

Regards
Arun

</I>&gt;<i> We believe that website authors have strong incentive to facilitate

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To that end we would like to propose adding an autocompletetype attribute
</I>&gt;<i> [1] to the HTML5 specification, as a complement to the existing

</I>&gt;<i> looking forward to feedback and suggestions from the broader community.
