</I>&gt;<i> No, I don&#8217;t want to use them, since only about one person in a million

</I>&gt;<i> the absence of those characters in fonts&#8212;the only commonly available

</I>&gt;<i> code2001, and it does not seem to be distributed by its author any more.
</I>
Well, any new feature will take time to get adopted. We live in the future 
here. That it doesn't work yet isn't a valid argument against it. :-)


&gt;<i> Comparing this with how well &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&#178; works, I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think anyone who understands the implications will give a second 
</I>&gt;<i> though to using such Plane 1 characters in HTML documents.
</I>
If it works well, I think we're good. Problem solved.


&gt;<i> &gt; Alternatively, you can use MathML to mark up the equation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or I could use LaTeX and get a presentation of acceptable quality. Or an 
</I>&gt;<i> image, as people still widely use. The question was about markup of 
</I>&gt;<i> physical quantities in HTML. Using other tools just to present a casual 
</I>&gt;<i> equation in running text would be disproportionate.
</I>
MathML is merely one of several options available to HTML authors that I 
was enumerating. It is obviously not the only one. For more complicated 
cases, it may be the preferred option (e.g. if you have fractions, 
calculus, etc). For simpler cases, e.g. a single variable, it's obviously 
not simpler than just using &lt;var&gt;.



&gt;<i> &gt; Whether you want something in italics or not is more a matter for CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than a matter for HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In many contexts, by long traditions and conventions, the use of italics 
</I>&gt;<i> is a matter of content, not casual presentation.
</I>
Well, kinda. The content is &quot;variable&quot;, or &quot;planck constant&quot;, or &quot;pi&quot;; the 
presentation as a set of pixels representing an italics /i/ vs an audio 
sample that says &quot;eye&quot; vs a set of raised dots in Nemeth Braille is the 
presentational aspect. As such I think it's fair to say that the italics 
is a mapping of the &lt;var&gt; semantic to display presentation via CSS.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Should we consider the var element as covering physical quantities 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; too? After all, they can be regarded as variables in a broad sense, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as symbols that denote different values in different situations. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, &lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt; would be odd, wouldn't it, since the symbol 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; denotes a universal constant of nature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can look at it as being a variable whose value is a constant of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nature. I've clarified the spec to indicate that this is fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t think you have clarified whether &lt;var&gt; is suitable for 
</I>&gt;<i> physical quantities, but I guess you meant to imply it&#8212;even though 
</I>&gt;<i> there is not a single example about markup for physical quantities.
</I>
Given that the spec contains the exact example you gave (E=mc^2), and 
given that the definition explicitly includes &quot;an identifier representing 
a constant&quot; as one of the uses for the element, I have to disagree with 
your assessment.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, it seems that it doesn&#8217;t really matter. The &lt;var&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element has now been defined to have such a wide and vague meaning that 
</I>&gt;<i> it is pointless to use it. There is little reason to expect that any 
</I>&gt;<i> software will ever pay attention to &lt;var&gt; markup on any semantic basis.
</I>
You seem to imply that there was reason to expect so before, which is 
certainly news to me! I would not really expect these elements to be used 
for anything other than styling hooks.


&gt;<i> So authors will use &lt;i&gt; if they think italics is semantically essential, 
</I>&gt;<i> and &lt;var&gt; won&#8217;t be used much.
</I>
That seems to be the status quo.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A programming language variable is something that is _not_ 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; conventionally rendered in italics. Rather, they are usually (though 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for no really good reason) rendered in a monospace font, like any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; other expressions in computer languages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed. And vectors are usually bold.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So why should authors be told to use markup that by default (and always 
</I>&gt;<i> when CSS is off) results in programming language constructs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> italicized? Flagging &#8220;placeholders&#8221; with italics (as in &#8220;issue the 
</I>&gt;<i> command &lt;kbd&gt;rm &lt;i&gt;filename&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt; to delete a file) is a widely used 
</I>&gt;<i> and understood style, but programming language variables are a 
</I>&gt;<i> completely different issue.
</I>
Well it's entirely up to the authors, of course; if they would rather only 
use &lt;div&gt;s and &lt;span&gt;s then there's not much we can do to stop them. 
However, some authors like the ease of maintenance that comes from using 
elements as a general classification mechanism and classes to provide 
fine-grained control, and it is mostly for them that HTML provides a 
variety of more specific elements like &lt;var&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Too bad there's no example of&lt;var&gt; used in programming context. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; current wording suggests that it would be normal, when discussing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; programming, to write, say, &quot;Then we define the variable 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;var&gt;myFoo&lt;/var&gt; of type&lt;code&gt;fooType&lt;/code&gt; with initial value 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/code&gt; - -&quot;, which really makes no sense, even if we use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; both&lt;var&gt; and&lt;code&gt; for myFoo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why does it make no sense?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because it implies that in default rendering, identifiers of variables 
</I>&gt;<i> appear in italics whereas identifiers of types or classes do not. Why 
</I>&gt;<i> would anyone use extra &lt;var&gt; markup when it has no other implications 
</I>&gt;<i> than requiring extra CSS code to remove (when possible) italics?
</I>
To enable easier maintenance of the markup and easy self-documenting 
styling, same as pretty much all of HTML.
