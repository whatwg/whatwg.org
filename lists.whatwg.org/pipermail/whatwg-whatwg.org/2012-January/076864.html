imagine a car being built
with this constant paranoia in mind. It would take 3 hours to start an 
engine... Or maybe it would be impossible
all together... because, well, you might get killed in car... so no one 
will ever drive in a car anymore...
Let people have their own responsibility for what they do! This is like 
the lamest reasoning ever,
the approach of &quot;we will protect you even against your will&quot;... man this 
sounds like really scary politicians out there...
I understand the need for protecting users... fine by me, but by 
limiting developers?
The fact, that people are giving permission to operation they do not 
care to find information about to some program/site
they know nothing about... Well it's their choice...
Android? Fine for consumption devices (phone, tablet) but who would want 
that on desktop? On computer you want to work on.
And ChromeOS? I thing the commercial results of this products speak for 
themselves: do I need a terminal for my computer at home?
Maybe a choice (well at least theoretical, in reality I have no idea why 
would I do that)...
Am I a paranoid company administrator... maybe a choice... do I want a 
computer? Hell no! No ChomeOs, I want to use my computer.

Just a though :)
