</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether there are any other such a IME but I think many non

</I>&gt;<i> So should we add &quot;native&quot; attribute?
</I>
I think we need to separate the use case for controlling IME mode and hinting UA as to which type of text/script will be entered as Mounir suggested in the original email.

And I agree that we need to address Chinese and Korean IME use cases if we're adding Japanese IME use cases.  Also, IME behavior is very different depending on whether you're using pinyin or zhuyin/bopomofo in Chinese IME so we might need to differentiate those two as well.

</I>
On the other hand, inputmode is supposedly only a hint, right?   It doesn't affect the validation state of input elements.  Given that, how does it address such a use case?

</I>
But isn't type=email also a text field with autocompletion, no?  I agree that the UI might be similar on desktop browsers, but it could be completely different on mobile operating systems where UA could show a custom keyboard suitable to type in human names as opposed to arbitrary text.

How is that different from type=email where UA is supposed to assist user type in an email address?  It's not like we do a rigorous pattern matching to validate email addresses either.
