</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;video&gt; elements. There are commercial products that have been developed

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> events that occur on the &lt;video controls&gt; as part of reach and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engagement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data collection, eg. Did the user click the Play button on the video and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watch it all the way through? Did they click Pause? Did they drag to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seek?
</I>
Just listen for the 'play', 'paused', 'seeked', 'ended' etc events for  
this. The change doesn't cripple the &lt;video&gt; API at all. Listening for  
'click' doesn't tell you whether the user clicked play or pause or seeked  
or none of those, so it's quite useless for that purpose.

</I>&gt;<i> Rick makes some good points. It seems there is a clear cost to this  
</I>&gt;<i> change,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm afraid that there is little benefit, since it won't prevent the
</I>&gt;<i> proposed control-breaking scenario anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that danger of Mr. J&#228;genstedt's proposed scenario is that
</I>&gt;<i> the user is annoyed by being forced to watch and/or listen to a piece of
</I>&gt;<i> media against his/her will.
</I>
That's not what the change is solving.

&gt;<i> (As for preventing them from playing something
</I>&gt;<i> they want to play, if the creator of a web page didn't want you to watch
</I>&gt;<i> something, they wouldn't put it on a web page.) But even if click events
</I>&gt;<i> are blocked, there are many similarly annoying workarounds. For  
</I>&gt;<i> example...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Play video or audio with no controls at all, or even unattached to the
</I>&gt;<i> DOM tree
</I>&gt;<i> - Show the controls but block them with an absolute-positioned,  
</I>&gt;<i> transparent
</I>&gt;<i> div or image
</I>&gt;<i> - Play a video (with element in memory only, not on document) and draw it
</I>&gt;<i> to a canvas. The user will have no way to make controls show up at all.
</I>&gt;<i> - Render fake media controls using images or a canvas on top of the video
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think a more effective and useful approach, which does not require
</I>&gt;<i> removing existing API features, would be for browsers to indicate which
</I>&gt;<i> tabs are currently playing media and provide a UI for tab-wide mute that  
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> outside of the actual web content. Or you can just close the offending
</I>&gt;<i> tab/window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please consider reverting this change.
</I>
It appears to me that you and Rick don't understand what the change does  
or what problem it was solving.

The problem was this: if you want to do something when a user clicks on a  
video but not when the user interacts with the native controls, you're  
basically out of luck.

&lt;video controls onclick=&quot;if (paused) play(); else pause()&quot;  
src=foobar&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

If the user clicks on the video's rendering area (i.e. outside the  
controls), this works as intended. However, if the user clicks on the  
native play/pause button, the video plays and then immediately pauses  
again. The change fixes this.

You are still notified by a 'play' event when the user clicks play on the  
native controls, so you can do something when the user clicks play on the  
native controls.
