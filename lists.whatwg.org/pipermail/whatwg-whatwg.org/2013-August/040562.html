I don't really think this makes any sense. For example, it wouldn't handle 
viewport video changes as it's currently described.

The way the spec is defined now, it's the static position that is set -- 
the 'top' property is unaffected except indirectly by its dependency on 
the static position. What's wrong with that?


&gt;<i> It's important that this centering happen exactly once, at the moment 
</I>&gt;<i> the dialog is shown.  Whatever mechanism we come up with for this has to 
</I>&gt;<i> fit this constraint, so that authors can manipulate the offset 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves afterwards.
</I>
As soon as the authors sets the top explicitly, the static position is no 
longer used, so it just works.


&gt;<i> &gt; It's true that for seamless iframes we could change that, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usual use case for seamless iframes is something like blog comments, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so it's not clear that there's a use case for dialogs there. If there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was to be one, we could consider it. It sounds like a lot of work to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do if there's not a compelling need though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, I was given to understand that it *was* intended that dialogs be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to escape iframes through some mechanism.
</I>
That isn't specced currently. I'm not 100% I understand how it would work 
(I guess it would need a lot of infrastructure from CSS?), but I'm happy 
to do it if there's demand and if the CSS side is figured out.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The horizontal centering is done via the default CSS. The vertical

</I>&gt;<i> 'auto' and then the dialog be centered horizontally? Or is that not a

</I>
Hm, yeah, what I really meant was width:shrink-to-wrap. Is there a CSS 
value to explicitly select that yet?
