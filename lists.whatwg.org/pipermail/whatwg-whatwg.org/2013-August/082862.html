IE10 passes all test cases but WebKit and Gecko fails 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th test cases.

&gt;&gt;<i> It's strange for elements to linger around forever in the past names map after the element get associated with a new form element.

I think we overlooked it when we added the support for dynamically changing the owner form element.

&gt;&gt;<i> Since IE didn't support form attribute for a long time (or maybe still hasn't?), I don't think there is any compatibility concern.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what this sentence is saying.
</I>
What I mean is the form content attribute of a form control element used as in: myInputInput.setAttribute('form', 'myForm');

&gt;<i> form.foo works in IE last I checked.  So what are you saying IE didn't or doesn't support?
</I>
Yes. IE does have that behavior.  What IE doesn't is keeping a form control element in the past names map of a form element once the control got disassociated with the form element.

I think IE's behavior is much saner than what we've implemented in WebKit and Gecko.
