First, let's get down to use cases. Kyle did a great job of describing 
some key use cases:

</I>
&gt;<i> [Use-case S:] One CMS plugin wants to load &quot;A.js&quot; and &quot;B.js&quot;, where B

</I>&gt;<i> don't want there to be any big network-loading delay visible to the user 
</I>&gt;<i> between their click of the button and the running of that plugin's code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another CMS plugin on this same page wants to load &quot;A.js&quot;, &quot;C.js&quot;, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;D.js&quot;. This plugin doesn't know or care that the other plugin also 
</I>&gt;<i> requests &quot;A.js&quot;. It doesn't know if there is a script element in the

</I>&gt;<i> just wants to ask for A as a pre-requisite to C and D. But C and D have 
</I>&gt;<i> no dependency on each other, only a shared dependency on A. C and D 
</I>&gt;<i> should be free to run ASAP (in whichever order), assuming that A has 
</I>&gt;<i> already run [once] some user-interaction that initiates the load of A, 
</I>&gt;<i> C, and D. This user interaction may be before the other plugin requested 
</I>&gt;<i> A, or after it requested A.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A.js&quot; can be requested relatively (via a &lt;base&gt; tag or just relative to 
</I>&gt;<i> document root) or absolutely, or it might be requested with the 
</I>&gt;<i> leading-// protocol-relative from, taking on whatever http or https 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol the page has, whereas other references to it may specify the 
</I>&gt;<i> prototcol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These plugins can't guarantee what ID's or classes they use are reliably 
</I>&gt;<i> unique without undue processing burden.
</I>
[I've trimmed the text Kyle wrote here, but also implicit in his 
description, as I understood it, was that A.js should only run once even 
if both plugins tried to load it.]

&gt;<i> [Use-case T:] I have two different calendar widgets. I want to pop one 
</I>&gt;<i> of them up when a user clicks a button. The user may never click the 
</I>&gt;<i> button, in which case I don't want the calendar widget to have ever 
</I>&gt;<i> executed to render. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It'd be nice if both calendar widgets were built sensibly so that

</I>&gt;<i> is unfortunately mis-behaving, and it will render itself as soon as its 
</I>&gt;<i> code is run. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, these two widgets are not &quot;equal&quot;. Perhaps one is better 
</I>&gt;<i> for smaller browser window sizes, and the other is better for larger 
</I>&gt;<i> browser windows. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, the point is, there's run-time conditions which are going to 
</I>&gt;<i> determine if I want to execute calendar widget A or B, or maybe I never 
</I>&gt;<i> execute either. But I want them both preloaded and ready to go, just in 
</I>&gt;<i> case, so that if the user DOES need one, it's free and ready to execute 
</I>&gt;<i> with nearly no delay, instead of having to wait to request as I would 
</I>&gt;<i> with only on-demand techniques.
</I>
&gt;<i> [Use-case U:] I have a set of script &quot;A.js&quot;, &quot;B.js&quot;, and &quot;C.js&quot;. B 
</I>&gt;<i> relies on A, and C relies on B. So they need to execute strictly in that 
</I>&gt;<i> order. [Now], imagine they progressively render different parts of a

</I>&gt;<i> and ready to go. It's [...] about minimizing delays between them, for 
</I>&gt;<i> performance PERCEPTION.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [For example, one of them might start playing a video, and another might 
</I>&gt;<i> introduce the &lt;canvas&gt; slides for that video. You want all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant scripts to be run at once, so there's no point where the page 
</I>&gt;<i> has a &lt;video&gt; element but doesn't have the &lt;canvas&gt;.]

These use cases are all very helpful. Thanks.

Jake also mentioned these requirements:

</I>|<i>   execution)
</I>|<i> - Is discoverable by pre-parsers (so async=false and old-IE's

</I>
And Kyle mentioned this scenario that we need to handle as well (not
strictly a use case, more a variant on the above use cases):

&gt;<i> I want to preload a script which is hosted somewhere that I don't
</I>&gt;<i> control caching headers, and to my dismay, I discover that they are
</I>&gt;<i> serving the script with incorrect/busted/missing caching headers.

</I>
The primary motivation is running scripts. Performance is just something 
we want all features to have, like security, accessibility, usability, 
support for all locales, etc.

Incidentally, I don't think the use case is or should be &quot;make it possible 
to write a performant script loading library&quot;. I think the use case should 
be more like &quot;make it unnecessary to ever write a script loading library&quot;.

</I>
I don't know about that. It makes for rather verbose script just to load 
scripts, which seems like a loss. Surely script loading should just happen 
without having to write extra script to do it.


All of the solutions proposed so far either entirely fail to handle some 
of the use cases, or only support them to the extent that they provide 
some tools with which you can implement scripts that handle the use cases.

IMHO, if you have to write a script to solve use cases like these, you 
haven't really solved the use cases. It seems that the opportunity we have 
here is to provide a feature or set of features that addresses these use 
cases directly, so that anyone can use them without much work.

How common are media-specific scripts?

Fundamentally the problem is that they're often not exactly the very same 
scripts, so the wins aren't as great as you might think.

But there's nothing stopping browsers from doing this today. File bugs 
with browsers. :-)

The article you cite basically answers your question: the problem isn't 
downloading and compiling the scripts, the problem is garbage collection 
and other intrinsic aspects of the JavaScript language and the rest of the 
Web platform.

This doesn't seem like it handles all the use cases (e.g. T and U).

The ES6 module doesn't address some of the use cases above, as far as I 
can tell (e.g. Q, U) and require a lot of work to handle some of the 
others. But it seems important that anything we add to HTML be designed to 
work with ES6 modules on the long run.

(I'm assuming the current state of this is:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules</A>
   <A HREF="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:module_loaders">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:module_loaders</A>

This doesn't seem like it would address many of the use cases, at least 
not without a bunch more supporting code. It also doesn't seem like it 
would really coordinate well with ES6 modules (unless there was some way 
to say &quot;by the way, this script implement that module&quot; or something, with 
'import' being able to essentially automatically invoke &quot;execute()&quot;).

It's not clear to me how script execution in the ES6 Module Loader world 
works when it's asynchronous. As in, if you document.appendChild() an 
inline script that has a dependency, does the calling script resume 
executing before the inner script? Or does it block on the network like a 
synchronous XHR?

(I spoke with wycats and he tells me there'll be spec hooks I use in HTML 
to invoke JS' loading logic so that in this case we'd use evalAsync and it 
would throw SyntaxError. Similar hooks will be available to make sure we 
use fetch.spec.whatwg.org for the loading logic.)

That's somewhat backwards from normal programming practices, though.



Here's a proposal that attempts to address all the use cases:

High-level overview:

  &lt;script&gt; elements get a new whenneeded=&quot;&quot; attribute, which delays the 
  execution of the script until the &lt;script&gt; element's execute() method is 
  called. (This essentially provides the same as the &quot;preload&quot; 
  suggestions.)

  &lt;script&gt; elements also get a new needs=&quot;&quot; attribute, which takes a list 
  of URLs. A &lt;script&gt; won't run (even if you call execute()) until all the 
  &lt;script src=&quot;&quot;&gt; elements referenced by its needs=&quot;&quot; attribute are 
  themselves ready to run. For example:

     &lt;script src=&quot;b.js&quot; needs=&quot;a.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
     &lt;script src=&quot;a.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

 ...will execute a.js when it's ready, and only then execute b.js. &quot;needs&quot; 
 basically implies &quot;async&quot; if its needs aren't met when it first tries to run.

 &lt;script whenneeded=&quot;jit&quot;&gt; is a special mode where instead of running once 
 the script's dependencies are met, it additionally waits until all the 
 scripts that depend on _it_ are ready to run. (&quot;Just in time&quot; exection.) 
 (The default is whenneeded=asap, &quot;as soon as possible&quot; exection.)

 You can manually increase or decrease a dependency count on &lt;script&gt; 
 elements by calling incDependencies() and decDependencies().


Details (tersely):

  scripts have a &quot;whenneeded&quot; mode, initially &quot;none&quot;, can also be &quot;asap&quot;, &quot;jit&quot;.
  scripts have a &quot;ready&quot; flag, initially false
  scripts have a &quot;needed&quot; flag, initially false.
  scripts have an &quot;already ran&quot; flag, initially false.
  scripts have an external dependency count, initially zero.
  documents have the following registries:
     url -&gt; script element (script registry)
     script element -&gt; scripts that this script depends on (dependencies)
  when a script element is removed from the document, it's removed from the 
  registries (ES6 module registry also).

  &lt;script&gt; gets attributes:
     whenneeded=&quot;&quot;: enumerated attribute, &quot;asap&quot; (invalid), &quot;jit&quot;, none (missing)
     needs=&quot;&quot;: space-separated list of URLs
     module=&quot;&quot;: name of module for ES6

  definitions:
    a script elemen tA &quot;depends&quot; on a script element B with URL C if B is 
      the &lt;script&gt; element registered as the &lt;script&gt; for URL C
    &quot;a script element's dependencies have been met&quot; when:
      - each script element that it depends on also matches this, and
      - there are no entries in the dependency registry for the element 
        that don't correspond to &lt;script&gt;s in the script registry
      - this script is &quot;ready&quot; and
      - this script's external dependency count is zero
    &quot;a script is ready to run&quot; when:
      - it's dependencies have been met, and
      - it's &quot;whenneeded&quot; mode is &quot;asap&quot; or missing,
        or, it's &quot;jit&quot; and all of the scripts that depend on it are
           either ready to run, or not needed

  &quot;prepare a script&quot; modifications:
     immediately before the step that today invokes fetch, add these steps:
      0. look up the resolved url in the document's registry. if there's an 
         entry already, abort these steps otherwise, add this script element 
         with this resolved url
     immediately before the final step, add:
      0. if there's a module=&quot;&quot; attribute, add this script as a module
         to the ES6 module registry, and make the logic that imports the
         module call execute() on the &lt;script&gt; block
      0. if the element has a &quot;whenneeded&quot; attribute:
           - set &quot;whenneeded&quot; mode to state of attribute (asap/jit)
      0. if the element has a &quot;needs&quot; attribute, split it on spaces, and
         for each value:
           0. resolve it relative to the element
           0. add an entry to the dependencies registry, this script 
              is dependant on that one
               - use the order of the entries in the needs=&quot;&quot; attribute

  &quot;execute a script block&quot; modifications:
     Change the &quot;If the load was successful&quot; branch to do this instead:
      0. mark self as &quot;ready&quot;
      0. check if we need to run
     ...and move the current steps into a separate &quot;run&quot; algorithm.

  &quot;check if we need to run&quot;:
    0. if &quot;whenneeded&quot; is not &quot;none&quot; and &quot;needed&quot; is not true, abort
    0. if the script is not ready to run, abort
    0. if the script did not already run:
        0. mark this script as &quot;already ran&quot;
        0. for each script that this one depends on and whose &quot;whenneeded&quot; 
           mode is &quot;jit&quot;, check if it needs to run
        0. run
    0. if we're still ready to run:
       for each script that depends on this one, check if it needs to run

  &lt;script&gt; gets a method, execute():
    0. mark as needed
    0. call execute() on each script we depend on  
    0. if we didn't depend on any, check if we need to run

  &lt;script&gt; gets a pair of methods, incDependencies() and decDependencies(), 
  that increase and decrease the dependency count by one, respectively
  decDependencies() throws if called when the count is zero. If 
  decDependencies() is called and it reduces the number to zero,


Here's what the use cases would look like (the function E() returns an 
element with the given attributes):

   Q:
   &lt;script id=&quot;social&quot; src=&quot;social-button.js&quot; whenneeded&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;button onmouseover=&quot;document.scripts.social.execute()&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/button&gt;

   S:
   // CMS plugin 1
   var A = E('script', { src: 'A.js', whenneeded: true });
   var B = E('script', { src: 'B.js', needs: 'A.js', whenneeded: true });
   document.body.append(A, B);
   function sawUserInteraction() {
     B.execute();
   };
   // CMS plugin 2
   var A = E('script', { src: 'A.js', whenneeded: true });
   var C = E('script', { src: 'C.js', needs: 'A.js', whenneeded: true });
   var D = E('script', { src: 'D.js', needs: 'A.js', whenneeded: true });
   document.body.append(A, C, D);
   function sawUserInteraction() {
     C.execute();
     D.execute();
   };

   T:
   &lt;script id=calA src=&quot;a.js&quot; whenneeded&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script id=calB src=&quot;b.js&quot; whenneeded&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
    function showCalendar(which) {
      if (which == 'a')
        document.scripts.calA.execute();
      else
        document.scripts.calB.execute();
    }
   &lt;/script&gt;

   U:
   &lt;script src=&quot;A.js&quot; whenneeded=jit&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;B.js&quot; whenneeded=jit needs=&quot;A.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script id=c src=&quot;C.js&quot; whenneeded=jit needs=&quot;B.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
    // when we need it...
    document.scripts.c.execute();
   &lt;/script&gt;

   V:
   &lt;script src=&quot;A.js&quot; whenneeded&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;B.js&quot; whenneeded needs=&quot;A.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script id=c src=&quot;C.js&quot; whenneeded needs=&quot;B.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
    onerror = function (message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
      // report error
    }
    // when we need it...
    document.scripts.c.execute();
   &lt;/script&gt;

   W:
   &lt;script src=&quot;A.js&quot; whenneeded&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;B.js&quot; whenneeded needs=&quot;A.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script id=c src=&quot;C.js&quot; whenneeded needs=&quot;B.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
    // when we need it...
    onerror = function (message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
      document.currentScript.incDependencies();
      // since the dependency count is never reduced, the script blocks
      // all the scripts that depend on it forever
    }
    document.scripts.c.execute();
    onerror = null;
   &lt;/script&gt;

   X:
   &lt;script src=&quot;deps.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;build.js&quot; needs=&quot;deps.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   // in deps.js:
   var me = document.currentScript;
   me.incDependencies();
   var image = new Image();
   image.src = 'image.png';
   image.onload = function () {
     me.decDependencies();
   };

   Y: 
   &lt;script src=&quot;slowLoad.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;script src=&quot;next.js&quot; needs=&quot;slowLoad.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   // in slowLoad.js:
   var me = document.currentScript;
   me.incDependencies();
   setTimeout(init, 1000);
   function init() {
     // ok, we're ready
     me.decDependencies();
   }

   Z:
   The easiest way to do that one would just be to put the &lt;script&gt; after 
   the &lt;nav id=&quot;menu&quot;&gt; element in the DOM.


Looking at the other requirements:

 - Fallback: the fallback is just to execute the scripts in document 
   order. This doesn't work when &quot;async&quot; is used, unfortunately, but it 
   does work when whenneeded=&quot;&quot; is used.

 - Pre-parsers should discover these fine if they're in markup. OBviously, 
   for script-generated scripts, that won't work.

 - As far as caching goes, the headers shouldn't affect this mechanism, so 
   it'll work fine even with broken headers. (Obviously it'll work better 
   across sessions if the headers aren't broken.)


Any comments on this proposal?

Unfortunately, since you are so verbose in your e-mails, it is impractical 
to go back and read everything you've written. Just this brief thread had 
something like 1300 lines from you alone (out of 2500 lines and a dozen 
participants). The reality of this is that we can't remember everything 
you've ever written. Sorry.

I read everything.


&gt;<i> That was way more than I wanted to write, and probably way more than

I encourage you to work on editing. It's possible to express the same 
ideas in much shorter text. For example, use case U above is adequately 
expressed in the one paragraph I edited it down to, but you had it spread 
over many paragraphs. The key is to notice when what you are saying merely 
repeats something you've already said, and to just pick the expression of 
the idea that says it best, and remove the other one. Another example 
would be saying &quot;X doesn't want A, it wants not-A&quot;. You don't have to say 
the first part -- if it wants not-A, then it usually obviously doesn't 
want A. So you can just say &quot;X wants not-A&quot;. Similarly, if you ever start 
a sentence with &quot;Again&quot; (or indeed &quot;similarly&quot;!), you have a good 
candidate for something being redundant. :-)

Well they don't address the use cases directly. They provide APIs that can 
then be used to write script to address the use cases.


&gt;<i> How does standardizing that suggestion (turning it from a MAY into a 
</I>&gt;<i> MUST) further complicate the loading algorithm, especially since there's 
</I>&gt;<i> over a decade of proof in IE that it works and works fine, and it's 
</I>&gt;<i> already detailed as a suggestion in the spec?
</I>
I disagree with the premise of the question (that IE proves it works 
fine), since IE didn't implement exactly what the spec wrote plus that, it 
implemented variants that are hard to distinguish. But in any case, that 
didn't address the use cases directly either.


&gt;<i> In neither case do I see how this unduly complicates the loading 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm? It ONLY pauses it between load and execute, under certain 
</I>&gt;<i> conditions. It doesn't change any of the order of the algorithm.
</I>
One can complicate by adding as well as reordering. The question is 
whether it's &quot;unduly&quot;. In practice my proposal above is much more 
complicated than that, but it does so to address the use cases.


&gt;<i> For instance, content-management-systems (through plugins) load 
</I>&gt;<i> different items into a page independently of other plugins. Those 
</I>&gt;<i> plugins have no knowledge of the complete content/markup-structure of 
</I>&gt;<i> the page, and so they would be unable to reliably create &lt;script&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> elements with unique ID's, without just guessing by creating really 
</I>&gt;<i> obscure ID's. Not perfect/perfectly reliable, and certainly ugly and 
</I>&gt;<i> more work for them to do. Every plugin would have to come up with its 
</I>&gt;<i> own ID-generation mechanisms. Asking for inconsistencies/problems.
</I>
This seems like a generic problem with every mechanism that uses IDs.
