Just set the max=&quot;&quot; attribute instead.

If you have a numeric code (i.e. &quot;0000&quot; is different than &quot;0&quot;) then 
type=number is the wrong type; you should instead use:

   &lt;input type=text pattern=&quot;[0-9]{4}&quot; maxlength=4 inputmode=numeric&gt;


&gt;<i> Using input[type=text] is not desirable because (e.g.) it pops up a 
</I>&gt;<i> alphabetical keyboard on iOS instead of a numeric keyboard.
</I>
That's fixed by inputmode=numeric.

That will work, yes. It's not conforming, because that way validators will 
warn you that what you're doing isn't going to work going forward.

Generally speaking, though, even with legacy browsers, if you're asking 
for a _number_ then maxlength=&quot;&quot; isn't useful. Supposed you want a number 
between 0 and 9999. Well, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;00000.0000000000&quot; are the same number, 
even though one is longer than 4 digits.

</I>
That's either what most browsers seemed to do when I tested it, or it was 
the most consistent thing to specify based on other things that were 
consistently implemented (e.g. the &quot;.textLength&quot; attribute's behaviour).


&gt;<i> This is counter intuitive for users and authors who typically intend to 
</I>&gt;<i> restrict the length by the number of composed character sequences.
</I>
There's actually a number of possible things people might intuitively 
expect it to do -- count graphemes, count Unicode code points, count 
composed characters, count monospace width, count bytes, etc. It's not 
clear to me that there's one answer, nor that, in fact, most authors have 
any idea that there are so many answers to the question &quot;how long is my 
string&quot;.

That's authoring conformance criteria, not implementation conformance 
criteria.

Specifically, UTF-16 code units.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In fact, this is the current shipping behavior of Safari and Chrome.

Which version of IE? I wonder if this changed at some point.


&gt;<i> Interestingly, an attempt like &lt;input pattern=.{0,42}&gt; to limit the

</I>&gt;<i> units.) The reason is apparently that &quot;.&quot; means &quot;any character&quot; in the 
</I>&gt;<i> sense &quot;any code point&quot;, counting a non-BMP character as two.
</I>
This is inherited from JavaScript.

Because it's a likely authoring mistake.

Right.

&quot;Clearly&quot; is not the word I would use, at least from the user's 
perspective. Why is pressing alt+a on the keyboard two characters? Or is 
it one? How can you tell, as a user? Why is it different than alt+i i? Or 
is it not? How can you tell, as a user?

(It's equally unclear if you use UTF-16 code units, of course.)

These arguments are pretty strong, I think.

Fundamentally I don't think there's much to argue for one way or the other 
here. Every answer is unintuitive or bad to someone.

There's a consistency argument -- everything in HTML and JS operates on 
UTF-16 code units, so this should too -- but it's not very strong.

&gt;<i>From testing, it seems to me that browsers vary in what they do. For 
</I>example, I can enter &quot;&#252;&#252;&quot; in Chrome and Firefox (U+00FC), but &quot;o&#7640;o&#7640;&quot; in 
Chrome and only &quot;o&#7640;&quot; in Firefox (&quot;o&quot; with U+1DD8). Similarly, I can enter 
&quot;&#65834;&#65834;&quot; in Chrome but only &quot;&#65834;&quot; in Firefox (U+1012A). However, I can only 
enter one &quot;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2367;&quot; in Chrome, and can only enter half of it in Firefox 
(U+0915 U+094D U+0937 U+093F, Devanagari kshi), and I can enter any number 
of &quot;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&#2367;&quot;s in Chrome, but only two in Firefox (U+093Fs). And could 
only enter &quot;&#2359;&#2359;&quot; in Chrome, not any number of those (U+0937). And weirdly, 
while I can paste each part of &quot;&#127464;&#127469;&quot; as a separate character, I can only 
backspace it as one, but it counts as two for maxlength=&quot;&quot; purposes 
(U+1F1E8 U+1F1ED). Safari seems to behave the same as Chrome, 
unsurprisingly. I couldn't test IE today.

I can't work out what this means for WebKit and Blink -- what are they 
doing? Some sort of old grapheme cluster definition that isn't quite the 
legacy grapheme cluster definition? Why doesn't it match what the cursor 
code is doing? If we're going to go with a user-friendly definition, it 
seems that matching user behaviour makes the most sense.

The current definition (UTF-16 code units) has the benefit of being very 
clear, if odd from any other perspective.

I don't mind using some other definition, if the browsers are going to 
implement it. But it's not clear to me what the definition should be. What 
Chrome and Safari are doing today isn't a sane answer, IMHO.
