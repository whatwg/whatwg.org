That's anything but simple. :-)

The CSS text-decoration model is actually quite complex. Also, there have 
been many proposals to split 'text-decoration' into sub-properties, so it 
is only going to get more complicated from there.

What's your use case? That is, when do you need to underline text?

Or, indeed, HTML.

</I>
That's not quite how it went down.

There are times where you really need text in your canvas, e.g. if you 
want to label things in your Mandelbrot set viewer.

You cannot (same as with text in a PNG).

They're mostly just DOMStrings because I haven't gotten around to changing 
them. Changing strings to enums is risky (I could introduce bugs when 
doing so), so I tend to avoid doing so unless someone makes a specific 
explicit request for a specific property to be converted.

Unfortunately, &quot;just&quot; is not really the right word here. The CSS inline 
box model, including the text-decoration part, are non-trivial. CSS has to 
deal with all kinds of things that we don't have to deal with in &lt;canvas&gt;, 
e.g. multiple baselines, multiple lines, etc.


&gt;<i> FWIW, some of the other properties have good reasons for being

</I>&gt;<i> very differently in CSS vs. 2D canvas.
</I>
Right. Underlining may fall into this bucket too.


But before we can determine this, we need to determine what your use case 
is. What are you trying to do? Why?
