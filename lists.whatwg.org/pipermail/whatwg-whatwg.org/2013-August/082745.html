&gt;<i> To recap history: early iterations of the Encoding API proposal did have

</I>
I thought about suggesting something like &quot;StringToBytes&quot;, but that seems
less obvious for the (probably) more common usage of encoding/decoding a
String, and it's still a bit off (though not *strictly* wrong) for
converting to UTF-16, UTF-32, etc.  I tend to think the slightly
unintuitive names of TextEncoder and TextDecoder aren't bad enough that
it's worth renaming them.


&gt;<i> While we're re-opening this can of worms, there's been a request to add a

I think you only need to say encode() and decode(), which is less of a win,
especially since creating two ways of doing the same thing means that
people have to learn both ways.  Otherwise, they'll see code end with
&quot;.encode()&quot; and not realize that it's the same as the &quot;.finish()&quot; they've
been using.

The names are the only things that are opposite.  TextEncoder is just a
streaming String-to-binary-blob conversion API, and TextDecoder is just a
streaming binary-blob-to-String API, and that's precisely what base64
encoding and decoding are.  That's the same whether you're converting
String-to-base64 or String-to-UTF-8.  The only difference is that the names
we've given to those ideas are reversed here.

One thing that might need special attention is that U+FFFD error handling
doesn't make sense for base64; errors should probably always be fatal.
