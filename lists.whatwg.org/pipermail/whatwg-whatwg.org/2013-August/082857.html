</I>
Can you elaborate on what viewport video changes are and what the
problem is?

It may not be a strong reason to change the spec, but in my experience,
implementing this in terms of static position in WebKit/Blink was very
challenging. As an example of the challenge, normally static position
is computed for a box during its layout, which is too early for dialog:
the dialog's dimensions must be known in order to center it, so it must
have been laid out already. Changing the static position after layout
breaks much assumptions in the code and would seem to require invasive
work across the render tree, layer tree, possibly painting, etc. In
contrast, if CSS is manipulated after the first layout pass, the layout
engine just works. So I found it convenient and stable to mutate CSS
'top' directly.

That said there have been some spec changes since my last attempt
that may make this easier, such as the dialog's cb is the icb. That
also means you can just use offsetTop/Left to implement dragging
so perhaps it's no longer helpful for getComputedStyle to return the
centered top.
