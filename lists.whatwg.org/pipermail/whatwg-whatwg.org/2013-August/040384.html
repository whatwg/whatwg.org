</I>
I think there are other invariants that make them equivalent that are 
relevant here. In particular:

D) When a Window is a script's global object, that script is always going 
   to be same-origin with the Window, so it will always pass the security 
   checks. (So, it's ok to not do the checks on Window and do them on 
   WindowProxy instead.)

I think actually invariants A and B are mooted by invariant D. That is, if 
they weren't true, we'd still be ok, because the security check is always 
going to be safe given D.

But if invariant D was broken, then it seems like A and B would become 
problematic if we moved the security checks to the WindowProxy rather than 
to the Window.

If invariant C is broken, e.g. because in some new language we don't have 
a WindowProxy and instead return the real Window for the current Document, 
or whatnot, whenever you access the Window object, it seems like we'd also 
actually want the security checks on Window.

Do these last two points affect your conclusions?


&gt;<i> I believe the model that puts all the magic in the WindowProxy, which

</I>&gt;<i> ES spec, and of making it clear exactly where the magic is, as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> the small but tangible side benefit of making the global (in the ES

</I>&gt;<i> the likelihood that future ES changes to how the global behaves will in 
</I>&gt;<i> any way affect the behavior of &quot;window&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The drawback is that it needs a bit more prose defining the behavior of 
</I>&gt;<i> WindowProxy....
</I>
It doesn't seem like that much more prose, at least, not if we're keeping 
the same level of precision. (If we want more, that's a different matter.)


What do other vendors think? This is in principle a purely editorial 
change. It would be cool if there was a WebIDL way to define WindowProxy, 
so that it could be unambiguously defined for all languages, but since 
it's a one-off object, maybe it's not worth it.
