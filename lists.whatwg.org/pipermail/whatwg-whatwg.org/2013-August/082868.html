</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> IE10 passes all test cases but WebKit and Gecko fails 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th test cases.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You must be testing Firefox 23 or earlier?  Firefox 24 or later passes all these tests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I was testing on Firefox 23 .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any case, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th tests are about properties not disappearing when they should, so those are not relevant here as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, looking at this more closely, it seems like you and I may be in violent agreement.  Right now the spec says:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If an element listed in the form element's past names map is removed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  from the Document, then its entries must be removed from the map.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is all the testcase above tests as far as I can tell, since it removes the control from the DOM after setting its @form.  The testcase doesn't test what happens when @form is set on a control without removing it from the DOM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for pointing that out.  I somehow missed that statement.  I didn't test the case of explicitly setting the form content attribute because IE10 doesn't seem to support the form content attribute on input elements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What happens in Firefox 24 and above is that when an element stops being form-associated with a form it is in fact removed from the past names map for that form.  I asked for a spec bug to be filed to that effect in <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879319#c4">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=879319#c4</A> but I'm not sure that ever happened....  :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's good to hear.  So we're definitely in agreement with respect to this new behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What I mean is the form content attribute of a form control element used as in: myInputInput.setAttribute('form', 'myForm');
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah, I see.  Yes, ok.  So in particular, the spec already requires that elements be removed from the past names map when removed from the DOM, so the only issue is with @form changes, and there is not likely to be much content relying on @form changes _not_ removing from the past names map.  I wholeheartedly agree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I'm particularly concerned about the case where form is explicitly changed.  With that, we can have an input element containing its owner form element, along with all other crazy edge cases.
</I>
Oops, an input element containing its owner element is fine.  What's not fine is the case where an input element contains a form element whose past names map points back to the input element and the input element's owner isn't the same form element.
