I don't know what &quot;a platform with meaningful filename extensions&quot;
mean. But other than that, &quot;yes&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Content-Disposition: inline

I assume that you realize that there is a problem if you think the
spec is clear, yet people don't understand what the spec intends to
say, or that implementations do different things, that there still is
a problem, right?

&gt;&gt;<i> People generally seem to have a harder time with getting header data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right, than getting markup right, and so I think that in all cases we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should display the &quot;save as&quot; dialog (or display equivalent download UI)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and suggest the filename &quot;A.txt&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that people fail to set headers. But do we have reason to believe
</I>&gt;<i> that people are setting their content-attachment headers with a filename
</I>&gt;<i> incorrectly in the wild?
</I>
Yes. Generally speaking people get headers wrong all the time. Even
when they send the headers.

&gt;<i> The problem with ignoring the server in the cross-origin case is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> a security risk (imagine a page trying to cause someone to download a
</I>&gt;<i> sensitive file, but claiming it's a local file with some filename specific
</I>&gt;<i> to the site, and then later asking for it to be uploaded again).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that, it seems sane to try to be consistent between cross-origin and
</I>&gt;<i> same-origin cases where possible, which means trusting the server over the
</I>&gt;<i> markup if there's a filename. It seems to me that if a filename is given
</I>&gt;<i> by the server, it's more likely to be right than wrong. (I agree that it's
</I>&gt;<i> more likely that there won't be a filename at all.)
</I>
I agree that having cross-origin and same-origin behave differently is
a problem. It's unclear to me if it's a bigger problem than that
people can't override the headers that a same-origin server is
sending.

Note that in this case the problem wasn't with the filename, but
rather with &quot;inline&quot; vs. &quot;attachment&quot;. At least if I recall correctly.
It's been a while.

</I>
IIRC, the problem here was that the server was always sending
Content-disposition: inline, which made it impossible to use &lt;a
download&gt;.
