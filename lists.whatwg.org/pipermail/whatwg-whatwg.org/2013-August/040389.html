</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The item types must all be types defined in applicable specifications
</I>&gt;<i> and must all be defined to use the same vocabulary.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, does this mean that I can't say:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div itemscope itemtype=&quot;<A HREF="http://acme.com/Foo">http://acme.com/Foo</A> <A HREF="http://zenith.com/Bar">http://zenith.com/Bar</A>&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
</I>
It depends on what <A HREF="http://acme.com/Foo">http://acme.com/Foo</A> and <A HREF="http://zenith.com/Bar">http://zenith.com/Bar</A> are. If 
they use the same vocabulary, then you can do it. If they're separate 
vocabularies, then no.


&gt;<i> The reason I ask is that there is some desire over in the schema.org 
</I>&gt;<i> community [2] to provide a mechanism for schema.org to be specialized. 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, in the case of an audiobook:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div itemscope itemtype=&quot;<A HREF="http://schema.org/Book">http://schema.org/Book</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.productontology.org/id/Audiobook">http://www.productontology.org/id/Audiobook</A>&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea being not to overload schema.org with more vocabulary, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> let vocabularies grow a bit more organically.
</I>
If they're the same vocabulary -- that is, the properties on this .../Book 
vocabulary and this .../Audiobook vocabulary don't clash -- properties 
mean the same thing in both -- then it's fine.


&gt;<i> This schema.org group is currently thinking of using a one off property 
</I>&gt;<i> additionalType that would be used like so:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div itemscope itemtype=&quot;<A HREF="http://schema.org/Book">http://schema.org/Book</A>&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;link itemprop=&quot;additionalType&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.productontology.org/id/Audiobook">http://www.productontology.org/id/Audiobook</A>&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally find this to be kind of distasteful since it replicates the 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanics that microdata's itemtype already offers.
</I>
It's essentially equivalent, yes.


&gt;<i> So, my question: is it the case that itemtype cannot reference types in 
</I>&gt;<i> different vocabularies like the example above? If so, I'm curious to 
</I>&gt;<i> know what the rationale was, and if perhaps it could be relaxed.
</I>
If they're different vocabularies (i.e. the same terms are used to mean 
different things), then you wouldn't know which was meant, so it would be 
ambiguous. There's an open bug about this topic with an open question:

</I>
&quot;Vocabulary&quot; means the set of properties that are defined. There's some 
non-normative text in the HTML spec that talks about this:

# The type gives the context for the properties, thus selecting a
# vocabulary: a property named &quot;class&quot; given for an item with the type
# &quot;<A HREF="http://census.example/person">http://census.example/person</A>&quot; might refer to the economic class of
# an individual, while a property named &quot;class&quot; given for an item with
# the type &quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/school/teacher">http://example.com/school/teacher</A>&quot; might refer to the
# classroom a teacher has been assigned. Several types can share a
# vocabulary. For example, the types
# &quot;<A HREF="http://example.org/people/teacher">http://example.org/people/teacher</A>&quot; and
# &quot;<A HREF="http://example.org/people/engineer">http://example.org/people/engineer</A>&quot; could be defined to use the
# same vocabulary (though maybe some properties would not be
# especially useful in both cases, e.g. maybe the
# &quot;<A HREF="http://example.org/people/engineer">http://example.org/people/engineer</A>&quot; type might not typically be
# used with the &quot;classroom&quot; property). Multiple types defined to use

There's been some discussion of this on this bug:

I haven't yet been able to understand what problem this would really 
solve, though. Could you elaborate on what you are doing that would 
benefit from doing this?

</I>&gt;<i> That said, it doesn't seem like anybody in the discussion other than

There's are actually cases where live NodeLists can be faster (e.g. 
because they can be lazily evaluated), so it's not immediately obvious 
which is better.

Since this has been implemented in Firefox already, I haven't changed the 
spec: <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=2431">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=2431</A>

Yeah, the real question is whether the underlying use cases are compelling 
enough for more browser vendors to care.

RDFa, microdata, and data-* have quite different data models. I don't 
think it would make sense to have one API for all three; at best two of 
them would have to be shoe-horned into something that didn't fit their 
model. (Also, it's not clear what the use case would be.)
