I would imagine most languages other than JavaScript would break that 
invariant. What other problems would it break?


&gt;<i> Because the current spec effectively calls for the global to be a

</I>
No, the global object is the Window, at least per the spec today. Why is 
this not accurate?

<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#script">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#script</A>'s-global-object


&gt;<i> That's not actually compatible with ES because of how &quot;var&quot; needs to 
</I>&gt;<i> behave in global scope.
</I>
Could you elaborate on this?


&gt;<i> So it seems to me that any implementor trying to implement this spec 
</I>&gt;<i> will go to their favorite ES implementation and discover that the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be implemented as written and must instead be mapped to some 
</I>&gt;<i> other conceptual model.  After thinking about it for a bit, the only 
</I>&gt;<i> obvious way to avoid having proxy-like behavior on the Window is to put 
</I>&gt;<i> it all on WindowProxy, which _already_ has proxy-like behavior no matter 
</I>&gt;<i> what.
</I>
I don't understand what mapping behaviour you think is conceptually needed 
on Window.


&gt;<i> At which point, I think we should spec it that way, for two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  It reduces the burden on implementors trying to understand this part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the spec and map it to what ES will let them do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2)  It reduces the likelihood that some modification to ES or the 
</I>&gt;<i> Window/WindowProxy specs will in fact make things unimplementable 
</I>&gt;<i> altogether in the future.
</I>
I agree that these are good goals.


&gt;<i> &gt; The difficulty with moving just the indexed properties are that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;length&quot; would now be on a different object than what it describes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that's a problem, honestly.  &quot;length&quot; on a Window returns 
</I>&gt;<i> the number of child windows.  An indexed access on a WindowProxy returns 
</I>&gt;<i> the corresponding child of its current Window.  It seems fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward...
</I>
Straightforward isn't the word I would use, but ok.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, it would complicate the WindowProxy magic -- now, instead of it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just being a proxy, it would be a proxy except for certain properties.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.  Of course WindowProxy is already not &quot;just a proxy&quot;: it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> transparently proxy enumeration or getOwnPropertyNames, for example.
</I>
It should act _exactly_ like Window. As far as I can tell, that means it 
_should_ proxy &quot;proxy enumeration&quot; and getOwnPropertyNames, whatever those 
are. Why do you think this is not the case?


&gt;<i> That's just not very clearly specified...  Again, I think we should just 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly define the behavior of WindowProxy using the ES MOP primitives.
</I>
I have no idea what that means, but I'm certainly happy to do so if it 
makes sense.
