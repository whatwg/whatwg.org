</I>
Could you elaborate on the use case? Why do you use them / want to use 
them? What are they for?

That certainly is a solid way of approaching things.

Right.


&gt;<i> It might be useful to mention explicitly in the spec that browsers do 
</I>&gt;<i> not generally allow non-script to be specified via the src attribute. 
</I>
The spec seems pretty clear about this:

# When used to include data blocks (as opposed to scripts), the data must 
# be embedded inline, the format of the data must be given using the type 
# attribute, the src attribute must not be specified, and the contents of 
# the script element must conform to the requirements defined for the 
# format used.

(This paragraph of &lt;script&gt; section.)


&gt;<i> And perhaps the spec should say that this is implementation-dependent 
</I>&gt;<i> and recommend that such references should be allowed, with due security 
</I>&gt;<i> considerations.
</I>
Implementation-dependent behaviour is, on the whole, just a source of 
confusion for authors, so I'd rather not do that.

You can just use XHR, instead.


&gt;<i> It's a bit odd that if you wish to set up a standalone application 
</I>&gt;<i> running in a browser (often called &quot;HTML5 application&quot;, without implying 
</I>&gt;<i> any particular version of HTML5), you can include e.g. scripts and 
</I>&gt;<i> images in separate files but not plain text or XML data
</I>
Why can't you put plain text or XML data in other files? So long as 
everything is same origin, you can read anything you want via XHR.
