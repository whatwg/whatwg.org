Thanks Mark, I had not fully explored this one yet!


&gt;<i> If I wanted to link *within* the HTML, it could still be &lt;a href=&quot;#test&quot;&gt;, correct?
</I>
That would be ideal, yes.


&gt;<i> Couldn't that be done by saying that for URIs inside a ZIP file, the base URI is effectively an authority-less scheme?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E.g., for &quot;foo.html&quot; the base uri would be &quot;<A HREF="zip://foo.html">zip://foo.html</A>&quot;.
</I>
Having thought about this some I think this would require pretty
invasive model changes, probably prohibitively so.

* Resources that can contain subresources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
workers, ...) would need to have an outer and inner location. If you
have e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;#test&quot;&gt; updating the address bar to
#path=test.html&amp;id=test is somewhat magic. For &lt;a href=&quot;other.html&quot;&gt;
it'd be pretty magic too.
*  For origin comparison you'd have to look at the outer location.

Either a sub-scheme or zip-path is a lot simpler as the changes are
limited to URL and Fetch rather than most end points, URL, and Fetch.


&gt;<i> I *think* the end effect here would be that from the inside, HTML, CSS and JS wouldn't have to be changed to be zipped.
</I>
Given the above I think that's not true. Unless you mean resources,
not specifications, in which case that could probably be correct.


&gt;<i> From the outside, if you want to link *into* a zip file, you have to be aware of its structure, but that's really always going to be the case, isn't it?
</I>
Yes, that's correct.
