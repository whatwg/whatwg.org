Why are we suddenly worrying about languages other than JavaScript?

&gt;<i> What other problems would it break?
</I>
Let me think about this; it's been a while...

&gt;&gt;<i> Because the current spec effectively calls for the global to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proxy-like object (or some sort of object that's not describable in ES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec terms at all, of course, but the idea of ES proxies is to be able

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the global object is the Window, at least per the spec today. Why is
</I>&gt;<i> this not accurate?
</I>
The current spec calls for the Window to be a proxy-like object, because 
that's the only way to implement the spec's indexed getter behavior.

&gt;&gt;<i> That's not actually compatible with ES because of how &quot;var&quot; needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behave in global scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on this?
</I>
&quot;var&quot; needs to be able to define non-configurable properties.  Proxies 
don't necessarily offer useful guarantees about being able to define 
such properties on them, and in particular the behavior for index/named 
getters in WebIDL precludes definition of non-configurable properties of 
the corresponding kind on the relevant object.

&gt;&gt;<i> So it seems to me that any implementor trying to implement this spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will go to their favorite ES implementation and discover that the spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot be implemented as written and must instead be mapped to some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other conceptual model.  After thinking about it for a bit, the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obvious way to avoid having proxy-like behavior on the Window is to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it all on WindowProxy, which _already_ has proxy-like behavior no matter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what mapping behaviour you think is conceptually needed
</I>&gt;<i> on Window.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean.  The &quot;mapping&quot; that needs to happen is &quot;how 
do I have a global that's not a magic proxy while being black-box 
compatible with the spec?&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think that's a problem, honestly.  &quot;length&quot; on a Window returns
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the number of child windows.  An indexed access on a WindowProxy returns
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the corresponding child of its current Window.  It seems fairly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straightforward...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Straightforward isn't the word I would use, but ok.
</I>
It's a lot more straightforward than what we have now, in terms of 
interactions with ES...

&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed.  Of course WindowProxy is already not &quot;just a proxy&quot;: it doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transparently proxy enumeration or getOwnPropertyNames, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should act _exactly_ like Window. As far as I can tell, that means it
</I>&gt;<i> _should_ proxy &quot;proxy enumeration&quot; and getOwnPropertyNames, whatever those
</I>&gt;<i> are. Why do you think this is not the case?
</I>
Because getOwnPropertyNames should return the own properties of the 
object, but doing that on a WindowProxy for a cross-origin window should 
not in fact return the Window's own properties.

Or another similar issue: getting a property descriptor from a 
WindowProxy (for a same-origin window) should probably never claim to 
have a non-configurable property, because on navigation the property 
will in fact disappear and non-configurable properties are not allowed 
to do that in ES.  See 
<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-script-coord/2012OctDec/0386.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-script-coord/2012OctDec/0386.html</A> 
and the threads it references.  But of course Window is required to be 
able to have non-configurable properties (see &quot;var&quot;).  So WindowProxy 
can't just forward [[GetOwnProperty]] on to the Window.

That link above also talks about how WindowProxy should probably reject 
attempts to define non-configurable properties on it altogether, which 
is an obvious non-starter for Window because &quot;var&quot; needs to work...

&gt;&gt;<i> That's just not very clearly specified...  Again, I think we should just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearly define the behavior of WindowProxy using the ES MOP primitives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea what that means
</I>
How objects behave in ES are defined in terms of various internal 
operations.  The set of operations ... keeps changing.  It used to be 
there were [[Get]], [[Set]], etc.  Now, with property descriptors, there 
are lower-level primitives like [[GetOwnProperty]], [[DefineProperty]], 
[[Delete]].  For example, WebIDL defines the behavior of all its objects 
in terms of those three primitives.  These low-level primitivies and how 
they interact define the meta-object protocol (MOP) for the abstract ES 
virtual machine.
