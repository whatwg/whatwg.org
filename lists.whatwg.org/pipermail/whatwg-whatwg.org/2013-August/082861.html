Are you sure this doesn't break web pages?  What do UAs do here?  What 
did they use to do?

&gt;<i> It's strange for elements to linger around forever in the past names map after the element get associated with a new form element.

I agree, though it's an obvious consequence of certain past 
implementation strategies.

&gt;<i>  Since IE didn't support form attribute for a long time (or maybe still hasn't?), I don't think there is any compatibility concern.

I'm not sure what this sentence is saying.

form.foo works in IE last I checked.  So what are you saying IE didn't 
or doesn't support?
