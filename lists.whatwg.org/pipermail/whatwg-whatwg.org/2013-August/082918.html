This seems to be dangerous in that it makes it really easy for the user to 
select a single item that expands into tens of thousands if not millions 
of files on a remote disk, which then all have to be synchronously 
enumerated to get the count so that code can then itself enumerate through 
the entire list.


&gt;<i> The advantage of avoiding the need for the 'directory' attribute would 
</I>&gt;<i> be that directory picking would work for existing content with &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=file multiple&gt; without needing to be changed. One disadvantage 
</I>&gt;<i> would be that existing content may depend on the file names in the 
</I>&gt;<i> FileList being unique.
</I>
I would have liked the file names to still be unique, by prefixing the 
names with the relevant parts of the subpaths (that is, if I select 
foo.txt and bar/ which contains another foo.txt, .files would contain 
&quot;foo.txt&quot; and &quot;bar/foo.txt&quot;), but I think that ship sailed (and now the 
spec explicitly requires otherwise).


&gt;<i> We would change the File interface to add a 'path' property, which would 
</I>&gt;<i> be the path (without the file name) of the file relative to the 
</I>&gt;<i> directory that was picked.
</I>
That might work.


&gt;<i> Currently authors can use HTMLInputElement.click() to open a system file 
</I>&gt;<i> picker. To give content the ability to open a system directory picker 
</I>&gt;<i> we'd add a corresponding .openDirectoryPicker() function.
</I>
So you wouldn't be able to pick a file and a directory as in the example 
above? That seems unfortunate...


&gt;<i> In my prototype implementation it took around 30 seconds to build the 
</I>&gt;<i> FileList for a directory of 200,000 files with a top end SSD
</I>
Wow. That's... not great in a UI.


&gt;<i> so depending on what the page is doing, directory picking could take 
</I>&gt;<i> some time. To allow content authors with styled &lt;input&gt; to provide 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback to users during scans of large directory trees we plan to have 
</I>&gt;<i> openDirectoryPicker return a ProgressPromise:
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/slightlyoff/Promises/blob/master/ProgressFuture.idl">https://github.com/slightlyoff/Promises/blob/master/ProgressFuture.idl</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'd then fire progress events at the promise specifying how many files 
</I>&gt;<i> had been processed so far.
</I>
I feel very uncomfortable with the idea that we'd intentionally have an 
expensive API like this. But I guess I don't really know what the use 
cases are, so it's hard to evaluate.



Anyway, I don't have a better suggestion right now. What has the 
implementation experience been like so far?
