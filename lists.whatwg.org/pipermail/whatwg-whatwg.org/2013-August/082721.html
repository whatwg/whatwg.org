</I>
One in which a file's name decides its processing.

So for example, Windows is such a platform. When you tell Windows to 
invoke a file, it examines the part of the name after the final dot, looks 
that string up in a registry, and uses the information there to decide how 
to invoke the file.

Most Unix shells are examples of platforms that are not extension-based. 
If you tell Bash to execute a file, it examines the file's contents to 
determine how to invoke it (e.g. looking for hash-bangs).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1) Content-Disposition: inline
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems unambiguous. Where's the problem?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) Content-Disposition: inline; filename=&quot;B.txt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, this seems unambiguous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3) Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;B.txt&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, seems clear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I assume that you realize that there is a problem if you think the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> is clear, yet people don't understand what the spec intends to say, or 
</I>&gt;<i> that implementations do different things, that there still is a problem, 
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>
Yes, that's why I asked &quot;where's the problem&quot;. :-)

I don't understand why the spec is ambiguous. Can you elaborate?


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; People generally seem to have a harder time with getting header data 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; right, than getting markup right, and so I think that in all cases we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; should display the &quot;save as&quot; dialog (or display equivalent download 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; UI) and suggest the filename &quot;A.txt&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that people fail to set headers. But do we have reason to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe that people are setting their content-attachment headers with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a filename incorrectly in the wild?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Generally speaking people get headers wrong all the time. Even when 
</I>&gt;<i> they send the headers.
</I>
Fair enough. (I would feel more comfortable with this if we had data 
specifically for this header, but let's move on.)


&gt;<i> I agree that having cross-origin and same-origin behave differently is a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem. It's unclear to me if it's a bigger problem than that people 
</I>&gt;<i> can't override the headers that a same-origin server is sending.
</I>
I don't know.


&gt;<i> Note that in this case the problem wasn't with the filename, but rather 
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;inline&quot; vs. &quot;attachment&quot;. At least if I recall correctly. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> been a while.
</I>
I'm not sure I know what problem you're referring to here.


&gt;<i> &gt; Well, this is a Mozilla site. Why is a filename set if you don't want 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it? Why would you want that video.ogg file downloaded as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;with-target.txt&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC, the problem here was that the server was always sending 
</I>&gt;<i> Content-disposition: inline, which made it impossible to use &lt;a 
</I>&gt;<i> download&gt;.
</I>
Content-disposition: inline doesn't make it impossible to use download=&quot;&quot; 
according to the spec as far as I can see.
