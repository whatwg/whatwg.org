</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think adding information to the click event is a great approach.
</I>&gt;<i> Event objects often have additional information, like mouse coordinates or

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although, how would you handle the case where a user clicks the mouse down

</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen button before letting go?
</I>
The click event doesn't fire until the mouseup occurs, and then it
fires on the element at that time.  This matches OS conventions, which
let you drag a mistaken click somewhere safe before releasing.

The problem with trying to use click, even with additional
information, is that *the UA-defined controls are unknown*.  Maybe
they have a play-pause button.  Maybe they've only got a scrubber, and
rely on clicking on the face to play/pause.  Maybe they do something
quite different.  The HTML spec makes *zero* guarantees about what's
inside of that, which is *intentional*.

The correct thing to do is listen for the defined events which
indicate that a particular state has changed.  I can't think of a
reasonable use-case for wanting to know which button was clicked that
isn't solved at least as well by just listening for the event for the
state change.

&gt;<i> What about an enum-esque integer constant instead of a string? Like
</I>&gt;<i> HTMLMediaElement.PLAY_BUTTON, etc.
</I>
Strings are how the web platform does enums - WebIDL even has support
for this in its syntax now.  Integer-based enums are broken legacy
horribleness.

&gt;<i> It's worth thinking about whether this can/should be generalized to all
</I>&gt;<i> elements that have sub-controls. For example, a number input has those
</I>&gt;<i> little up and down buttons.
</I>
Again, no, there's no guarantee whatsoever that a number input has
little up and down buttons.  On a mobile device, it might have no
particular controls, and when you click on it, it exposes a modal
thing with a flickable wheel.  In particular, my phone (an Android
running latest stock OS) exposes it as a plain text control, and when
you click on it, it brings up a number-pad virtual keyboard rather
than a qwerty one.
