</I> &gt;&gt; Why is the maxlength attribute of the input element specified to
 &gt;&gt; restrict the length of the value by the code-unit length?

Apparently because in the DOM, &quot;character&quot; effectively means &quot;code 
unit&quot;. In particular, the .value.length property gives the length in 
code units.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is counter intuitive for users and authors who typically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intend to restrict the length by the number of composed character
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sequences.
</I>
That is true. We should not expect end users to know whether a character 
they enter occupies one code unit or two, i.e. whether it is a BMP 
character or not. Then again, I don't expect most users to enter non-BMP 
characters, though this might be changing as e.g. emoticons become more 
popular.

&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, this is the current shipping behavior of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Safari and Chrome.
</I>
And IE, but not Firefox. Here's a simple test:

&lt;input maxlength=2 value=&quot;&amp;#x10400;&quot;&gt;

On Firefox, you cannot add a character to the value, since the length is 
already 2. On Chrome and IE, you can add even a second non-BMP 
character, even though the length then becomes 4. I don't see this as 
particularly logical, though I'm looking this from the programming point 
of view, not end user view.

&gt;&gt;<i> Can the specification be changed to use the number of composed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> character sequences instead of the code-unit length?
</I>
In contexts where you want to set maxlength in the first place, your 
reasons might well be related to limitations that apply to the code unit 
length. It's a different thing if the intent is to limit the amount of 
visible characters.

Interestingly, an attempt like
&lt;input pattern=.{0,42}&gt;
to limit the amount of *characters* to at most 42 seems to fail. 
(Browsers won't prevent from typing more, but the control starts 
matching the :invalid selector if you enter characters that correspond 
to more than 42 code units.) The reason is apparently that &quot;.&quot; means 
&quot;any character&quot; in the sense &quot;any code point&quot;, counting a non-BMP 
character as two.

&gt;<i> Also,

</I>&gt;<i> the code-unit length of the value of the element's value attribute

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't seem to match the behaviors of existing Web browsers or

</I>&gt;<i> unless I'm misreading something.  Namely, the value attribute set in

</I>
There seems to be a conflict here indeed. It is different from the 
character vs. code unit issue, however.

Definitions in 4.10.21.1 clearly imply that the length of the value of a 
control may exceed the limit set by maxlength. The &quot;Constraints&quot; part 
deals with the question what happens then (in form submission).
