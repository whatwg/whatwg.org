I think it would make sense to have a Promise-based API for JSON parsing. 
This probably belongs either in the JS spec or the DOM spec; Anne, Ms2ger, 
and any JS people, is anyone interested in taking this?

I don't understand why there'd be any difficulty in sending large objects 
between workers or from a worker to the main thread. It's possible this is 
not well-implemented today, but isn't that just an implementation detail?

One could imagine an implementation strategy where the cloning is done on 
the sending side, or even on a third thread altogether, and just passed 
straight to the receiving side in one go.

That was my initial reaction as well, I must admit.

Serialising is hard to do async, since you fundamentally have to walk the 
data structure, and the actual serialisation at that point is not 
especially more expensive than a copy.


&gt;<i> The natural course of action would be to do the following:

I'm not sure what you mean by JSON object. JSON is a string format. Do you 
mean a JS object data structure?

&gt;<i> 2. send the object to a worker;
</I>&gt;<i> 3. apply some post-treatment to the object (possibly a noop);
</I>&gt;<i> 4. write/upload the object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having an asynchronous JSON serialization to some Transferable form 
</I>&gt;<i> would considerably the task of implement step 2. without janking if data 
</I>&gt;<i> ends up very heavy.
</I>
I don't understand what JSON has to do with sending data to a worker. You 
can just send the actual JS object; MessagePorts and postMessage() support 
&quot;raw&quot; JS objects.


&gt;<i> So far, I have discussed serializing JSON, not deserializing it, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe that the symmetric scenarios also hold.
</I>
No, they are quite asymetric. Serialising requires stalling the code that 
is interacting with the data structure, to guarantee integrity. Parsing is 
easy to do on a separate worker, because it has no dependencies -- you can 
do it all in isolation.

</I>
I don't understand what this means. Transferable is about neutering 
objects on one side and creating new versions on the other. It's the 
equivalent of a &quot;move&quot;. Your use cases were about making copies, as far as 
I can tell (saving and backing up).

As a general rule, JSON has nothing to do with Transferable objects, as 
far as I can tell.

I really don't understand this. Are you asking for a way to move a JS 
object from one thread to another, killing references to it in the first 
thread? What's the use case? (What would this have to do with JSON?)

</I>
It's not clear to me what the use case is, but if the desire is to move a 
batch of data from one thread to another, then this is certainly one way 
to do it. Another would be to just copy the data in the first place, no 
need to move it -- since you have to pay the cost of reading all the data 
in the first place, why not do it as part of the postMessage(), rather 
than first building a binary data representation that you'll have to 
reparse on the other side?

</I>&gt;<i>    // Length of the list is unpredictable
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
Why serialise it? If you want to post this across a MessagePort to a 
worker, or back from a worker, why not just post it?

   var a = { ... }; // from above
   port.postMessage(a);


&gt;<i> &gt; What are the data you want to collect? Is it all at once or are you

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the suggestion. I am effectively working on refactoring

</I>
Assuming by &quot;Firefox Desktop&quot; you mean the browser for desktop OSes called 
Firefox, then, why not just do this in C++? I don't understand why you 
would constrain yourself to using Web APIs in JavaScript to write a browser.

Hear hear.

This isn't a particularly new idea, FWIW. See, for example, protocol 
buffers, or ASN.1's BER. Those are even self-describing to some extent, 
like JSON; protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP don't even do that, they just 
encode their data in a well-defined order with no delimiters at all.
