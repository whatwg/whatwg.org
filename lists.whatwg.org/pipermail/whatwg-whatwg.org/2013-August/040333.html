I've deferred to the as-yet non-existent CSS Scoped Style Sheets 
specification on these matters.

My concern with @font-face is that if we allow it and treat it as a global 
rule, it lets a scoped sheet mess around quite dramatically with the rest 
of the page, and if we disallow it, it prevents a pretty useful feature -- 
if people find type face control useful outside of scoped sheets, then why 
would they not want it just as much when syndicating the same content?

Same with the @-rules for animation. Can we just not do good animations in 
scoped style sheets?

Or indeed with components. Telling authors they can't do good typography 
with their components, or can't define keyframes for animation, etc, seems 
like a losing proposition.

I would be concerned about namespace collisions. We've made that mistake
with JS, where different libraries would stop on each other, to the point 
where we're now adding modules, and JS actually has scoping built-in, so 
it'd be even more dire with CSS, as far as I can tell.
