This is on my radar, but note that in the meantime you can use:

   &lt;style&gt;@import &quot;my.css&quot;;&lt;/style&gt;

At some point I plan to see how common it is for &lt;style&gt; elements to have 
@import rules; if it's common, then it would make sense to allow &lt;link&gt; in 
&lt;body&gt; for scoped style sheets as well. I hesitate to do it without a body 
of evidence showing it would be used a lot, because it's difficult to 
convey that &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet scoped&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt; would be allowed, while 
still having &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt; and &lt;link rel=&quot;next&quot; href=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
non-conforming. I think authors would have more difficulty with the idea 
that certain rel=&quot;&quot; values are ok in certain places, than they would with 
the idea that certain attributes are ok there and others aren't. (With 
microdata, it's easier, because we just don't allow rel=&quot;&quot; at all.)
