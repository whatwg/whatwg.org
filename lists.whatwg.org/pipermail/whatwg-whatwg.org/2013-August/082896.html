It matters a lot when you only have GSM wireless connection, and barely loading anything at all.

</I>
Exactly.  I'd to make sure whatever API we come up gives enough flexibility for the UAs to decide whether a given resource needs to be loaded immediatley.

&gt;<i> My scope (as it always has been) put simply: I want (for all the reasons here and before) to have a &quot;silver bullet&quot; in script loading, which lets me load any number of scripts in parallel, and to the extent that is reasonable, be fully in control of what order they run in, if at all, responding to conditions AS THE SCRIPTS EXECUTE, not merely as they might have existed at the time of initial request. I want such a facility because I want to continue to have LABjs be a best-in-class fully-capable script loader that sets the standard for best-practice on-demand script loading.
</I>

Because of the different network conditions and constraints various devices have, I'm wary of any solution that gives the full control over when each script is loaded.  While I'm sure large corporations with lots of resources will get this right, I don't want to provide a preloading API that's hard to use for ordinary Web developers.

</I>

Yes, we should definitely consider how this preloading API works with ES6 modules.

I don't think it'll be confusing if the script had noexecute.  We can even call it noautoexecute if we wanted.

&gt;<i> But I'm fine either way here. The same question and risk of confusion

</I>
I like the simplicity of noexecute and excute().  However, I'm a little worried that it doesn't provide any information as to how important a given script is.  So Web browsers have no choice but to request all scripts immediately.

I'd like to eventually provide APIs that allow authors to codify which scripts are &quot;vital&quot; so that Web browsers can properly prioritize each script request.

Implementation wise, noexecute/execute() will be extremely easy to implement in WebKit.

&gt;<i> I.e. something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script src=&quot;script1.js&quot; id=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script src=&quot;script2.js&quot; dependencies=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would run correctly in downlevel browsers, but would force the scripts
</I>&gt;<i> to be blocking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script src=&quot;script1.js&quot; id=&quot;s1&quot; async&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script src=&quot;script2.js&quot; async dependencies=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would give you performant non-blocking behavior in downlevel browsers,
</I>&gt;<i> but at the expense of the scripts not always running in scripts in the
</I>&gt;<i> right order.
</I>
Use defer instead?
