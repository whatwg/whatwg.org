Why would shops be ok with having additional material around their page? 
That seems like a supremely bad idea from a security perspective.

There's no way we can get to the point where you're overlaying content on 
other sites with their URL appearing in the URL bar. That would let people 
do things like overlay their UI on top of Amazon's shopping cart UI and 
get people to give them their credit card details.


&gt;<i> say, when I enter <A HREF="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITCC.2005.129,">http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITCC.2005.129,</A> it'd be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful if the URL stays in the location bar, until I navigate away from 
</I>&gt;<i> the page that is ultimately loaded.
</I>
Would your UI disappear at this time too?

The pages can do this today by just having &lt;base target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt; in their 
markup. Is that insufficient?


&gt;<i> Or, with a higher z-index, there might also be other navigation, e.g. a 
</I>&gt;<i> link to <A HREF="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ITCC.2005.129,">http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ITCC.2005.129,</A> which 
</I>&gt;<i> is a separate resource from the main IEEE Xplore that gets linked from 
</I>&gt;<i> dx.doi.org, without such alternative ieeecomputersociety link being in 
</I>&gt;<i> IEEE Xplore itself.
</I>
I don't follow.

I think this request makes sense. It's just not clear that there's a 
compelling enough use case for it. How common is it for people to want to 
provide sites such as you describe?
