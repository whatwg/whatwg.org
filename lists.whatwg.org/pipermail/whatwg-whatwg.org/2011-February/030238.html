That's maybe a bit vaguer than I was hoping for when asking the question. :-)

Why does it have to be a single file? Would multipart MIME be acceptable?

A single file is a solution, not a problem. What is the problem?

Now that's a problem. :-)

It seems like what you need is a package mechanism, not necessarily a way 
to run workers without an external script.

I expect we'll add these in due course, probably around the same time we 
add cross-origin workers. (We didn't add them before because exactly how 
we do them depends on how we determine origins.)

That's not a Web problem. I recommend contacting your browser vendor about 
it. (It's probably security-related.)

How can you tell the difference between &quot;the thread takes 3 seconds to 
start&quot; and &quot;the thread waits for the user to close a thread&quot;, if it takes 
3 seconds for the user to close a thread?

My point is from a black-box perspective, one can never firmly say that 
it's not just the browser being slow to start the thread. And we can't 
disallow the browser from being slow.


&gt;<i> That doesn't mean it needs to start immediately, but if I start a thread 
</I>&gt;<i> and then do nothing, it's very bad for the thread to sit in limbo 
</I>&gt;<i> forever because the browser expects me to take some action, without 
</I>&gt;<i> anything to tell me so.
</I>
I don't disagree that it's bad. Hopefully browser vendors will agree and 
this problem will go away.

</I>
It's queued if you asked it to start and it hasn't yet started.

We can't, because it depends on the hardware. For example, we can't say 
&quot;you must be able to allocate a 1GB string&quot; because the system might only 
have 500MB of storage.

</I>
It's not much of a standardised limit if there's still an escape clause.

I'm happy to put recommendations in if we have data showing certain 
specific limits are needed for interop with real content.

</I>&gt;<i> Failure to return an error should mean that the worker can be run soon,

</I>
All workers should run soon, not maybe in the future. Not running a 
worker should be an unusual circumstance. Errors that occur in unusual 
circumstances aren't errors that authors will check for.

This dicussion comes from Chrome having a very small limit currently. It 
is my understanding that this limit is temporary and not representative 
of what the API will be like once widely implemented.

</I>
It's basically due to limitations in how browsers are built. The DOM 
implementations have shared global state that isn't thread-safe.

It's the API itself that isn't thread-safe, unfortunately.

</I>
You can't currently do anything with audio or video in a worker. Image 
data from canvas can be passed along, though. How fast the throughput is 
depends on the browser.


&gt;<i> 3) Introduce a set of &quot;shared&quot; objects, which are re-entrancy save

Not sure what this means.

</I>
The spec doesn't preclude browsers from implementing copy-on-write 
semantics, which essentially gives you by-reference. (We can't do actual 
by-reference without freezing values on both sides somehow, since 
otherwise you'd have race conditions.)

The reason the spec requires a 4ms clamp is that if you implement a 0ms 
clamp, pages break. (Note: the spec only clamps if the setTimeout() is 
called from another setTimeout().)


&gt;<i> Non-looping 0ms timers are common, to run code when the current call

Yeah, spec allows those fine.

</I>
Keeping the timers the same everywhere is good for sanity.

The idea being that if you have scheduled two timers to fire two seconds 
apart, and the user happens to leave the page and return, you don't want 
them all to fire at once.
