Given Anne's point (that this is already different in other contexts), and 
given the current deployed interop on this issue, I'm reluctant to change 
this. I agree that it's unfortunate that we needlessly differ from CSS 
here. It's another example of why it's important for us to define 
everything, and that we never leave anything up to UAs to decide. :-)

I'm happy to do either of these, but I'm very relunctant to change the 
spec away from what browsers do. Currently, browsers pretty much agree on 
how shadows work in composition, they just disagree over what gets 
composited (and even then it's only really WebKit that disagrees).

If there is interest in changing this, I think the best thing would be for 
browser vendors to indicate a commitment to change it, so that I can make 
sure I'm not changing the spec away from what browsers want to implement.

</I>&gt;<i> A nice benefit of this, though, is that tracing a straight line between

Looking at that demo, it seems that premultiplied removes possible options 
from the author. How do you go from red to actually transparent black, 
getting darker as you transition? Do you have to give a nearly-transparent 
black (alpha=0.01) to get around it or some such? That seems weird.

</I>
Can you elaborate on that? I'm interested in seeing the cases that you 
can't do in one or the other of the colour spaces we're discussing. If one 
is a strict superset of the other, then it would make sense to specify 
that we use that one. If you can do the same gradients in both, then 
interoperability seems more important.

The canvas gradient spec is pretty uniformly and interoperably implemented 
on this front:

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480</A>)%3B%0Ac.save()%3B%0Avar%20gradient%20%3D%20c.createLinearGradient(0%2C0%2C640%2C480)%3B%0Agradient.addColorStop(0%2C%20'rgba(255%2C255%2C255%2C1)')%3B%0Agradient.addColorStop(1%2C%20'rgba(0%2C0%2C0%2C0)')%3B%0Ac.fillStyle%20%3D%20gradient%3B%0Ac.fillRect(0%2C0%2C640%2C480)%3B%0Ac.restore()%3B%0A

It's easy to work around this issue:

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480</A>)%3B%0Ac.save()%3B%0Avar%20gradient%20%3D%20c.createLinearGradient(0%2C0%2C640%2C480)%3B%0Agradient.addColorStop(0%2C%20'rgba(255%2C255%2C255%2C1)')%3B%0Agradient.addColorStop(1%2C%20'rgba(255%2C255%2C255%2C0)')%3B%0Ac.fillStyle%20%3D%20gradient%3B%0Ac.fillRect(0%2C0%2C640%2C480)%3B%0Ac.restore()%3B%0A

I'm happy to change the spec on this, but I'm not going to change it ahead 
of the implementations. If you want this changed, I recommend getting the 
browser vendors to change this.

The data storage for ImageData need not be much bigger, since the browser

Yeah, this is actually already on the list of things to add to the next

Unfortunately pretty much nothing we can do here will get implemented and

you can't work around lack of implementations of specs by adding features 
to specs.

I understand. I agree that we should support this in due course. As I said 
before:

&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that anytime we add anything to canvas, implementors 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get so excited that they drop what they're doing and implement it (in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some cases, overnight!). This takes resources away from other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features. If we're to get the whole platform to improve, we need to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make sure that everything gets a chance to be implemented. This means 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we can't just be adding stuff to canvas all the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're making a slippery slope argument, I don't think it fits: I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> asked for one property to be added to the specs document; as an 
</I>&gt;<i> extension of the textBaseline attribute already in the document.
</I>
Lots of people are asking for just one property. Why is yours a higher 
priority than theirs?


&gt;<i> Currently, I can't use fillText with two separate font sizes, and 
</I>&gt;<i> underline them.
</I>
Sure you can:

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/?c.clearRect(0%2C%200%2C%20640%2C%20480</A>)%3B%0Ac.save()%3B%0Avar%20x%20%3D%2020%3B%0Avar%20y%20%3D%20200%3B%0Ac.textBaseline%20%3D%20'baseline'%3B%0Ac.font%20%3D%20'80px%20Verdana'%3B%0Ac.fillText('Hello'%2C%20x%2C%20y)%3B%0Avar%20dx%20%3D%20c.measureText('Hello%20').width%3B%0Ac.font%20%3D%20'40px%20Zapfino'%3B%0Ac.fillText('World'%2C%20x%2Bdx%2C%20y)%3B%0Adx%20%2B%3D%20c.measureText('World').width%3B%0Ac.fillRect(x%2C%20y%2B5%2C%20x%2Bdx%2C%202)%0Ac.restore()%3B%0A

But I agree that there are other things you can't do, like put a 
background colour behind the text that covers all the text (Zapfino in 
particular goes way outside its em box, for instance). It's something that 
we will address, we're just waiting for browser vendors to have 
implemented more of the current spec before adding more features. It's a 
prioritisation issue, that's all.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Nobody wants to see another vendor-specific extension; can we try to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; form an agreement on this, so we can avoid that?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the contrary, we _do_ want to see vendor-specific extensions. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's how we get implementation experience and how the Web improves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Standardisation is the penultimate stage in a feature's development, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after studying author practices, experimental implementations in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vendor-specific features, and studying use cases, and ahead only of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the final convergence of browser implementations
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your enthusiasm for the &quot;final convergence&quot; is charming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I made a poor generalization. Most of us do not want to see vendor-specific
</I>&gt;<i> extensions which stick.
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i> moz..transform = webkit..transform = transform = ...;
</I>
Sure, extensions should be a short-term thing.

I've noted in the spec that we should have an asynchronous canvas.toBlob() 
in a future version. I haven't added it yet because -- at the risk of 
sounding like a broken record -- we're waiting for browsers to catch up 
with implementing a lot of the other features in HTML first.

I agree that it would make a lot of sense, though.

Intentional. Images for &lt;img&gt; elements are always loaded, even if they're 
not in the document at all (e.g. just in script), because people 
historically used them for &quot;image overs&quot;.



(Over the past couple of months there have been a number of e-mails and 
threads about CSS issues and asking questions of implementators but not 
suggesting changes to the specs I edit. I have not responded to those 
e-mails. If you sent an e-mail on &lt;canvas&gt; to the WHATWG list before this 
week and haven't received a reply from me but wanted one, let me know.)
