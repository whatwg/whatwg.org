</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execute in a sandbox, as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, interesting. For &lt;object&gt;, this seems to be a unique feature of

</I>&gt;<i> to support javascript: in data=&quot;&quot; at all.
</I>
For the record, I removed Opera's &quot;support&quot; (I assume it was an unintended  
side-effect) for &lt;object data=&quot;javascript:...&quot;&gt; along with the rest at the  
time when I wrote my previous mail in this thread. This intentionally  
doesn't match what the spec says. (Disclaimer: this is only my opinion on  
something that isn't really my area of expertise, so others at Opera might  
decide that the spec is great and push in the opposite direction. It seems  
unlikely at this point, though.)

</I>
Even if there's no harm, it's unneeded complexity that so far doesn't seem  
to be needed for web compat, since it currently would only work in Firefox.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'll keep you posted if there are any compatibility issues that come up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with this. Assuming (boldly) there is not, would there be support from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other browsers to move in this direction and change the spec to match?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What the spec currently specs seems to be a reasonable compromise between
</I>&gt;<i> security, compatibility needs based on what browsers do today, use cases,
</I>&gt;<i> and consistency across the platform (usability), in that order.
</I>
What compatibility needs? The only thing I'm aware of is using &lt;img  
src=&quot;javascript:...&quot;&gt; to generate X BitMap images.[1][2] However, the  
examples would break if the execution was sandboxed as per the spec.

&gt;<i> Obviously if browsers implement something different, then I'll happily
</I>&gt;<i> move the spec to match, but it would be sad to just close off these
</I>&gt;<i> features without good reason.
</I>
Of what has been brought up so far, javascript: as an inline resource is  
not very useful at all, so IMO the only reason to keep it would be for  
legacy compat. I'll follow up on this again once the change to block  
inline javascript: URLs in Opera has been in the wild for a while,  
hopefully reporting that no compat issues have arisen.
