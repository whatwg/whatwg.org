<PRE>Hi Rich,

&gt;<i> We are also trying a different approach but we're not really coming up

none of which are suitable for different reasons. One option that works is,
on &lt;device&gt; click, presenting some kind of async authorization request.
However, if we're going to do that then we might as well just implement a
Javascript API to call the async authorization request in the first place
(in the process saving one user click).


I agree that clicking on the &lt;device&gt; element to bring up an
async authorisation request works well because it corresponds strongly
to the user's will to start and stop access to the device. However, I think
that we should not be trying to save the user a click, because that would
risk bothering the user with a dialog before they have made their intention
to grant access to the device explicit. The principal application of
&lt;device&gt; is to grant access to webcam devices which, I think, is sensitive
enough to warrant the user having to initiate the authorisation process.


&gt;<i> The &lt;device&gt; element requires JavaScript to do anything useful. Without
</I>Javascript all the authorization interfaces will still work and users will
still go through them to authorize access to their device but then...nothing
will happen if the page is not running JavaScript. That's not great.

&gt;<i> There's no fallback or interaction within non-scripted environments so a
</I>HTML element seems to be the wrong level for integration.


Since the primary use cases for this element are applications that require
scripting, I'm not sure that it make sense to worry about &lt;device&gt; when JS
is turned off or unavailable. Indeed, the applications that will use
&lt;device&gt; will probably require JavaScript for other purposes anyway. if JS
is disabled, I would expect those applications to render the usual, &quot;This
page requires JS&quot; message.


By &quot;fallback&quot; do you mean fallback content (if the device is unavailable)?
If so, doesn't section 3.2.5.1.6 of HTML5:
<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#embedded-content-0">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#embedded-content-0</A> cover this?


If the user agent doesn't understand the &lt;device&gt; tag, it should behave in
the same way as an HTML 4 user agent behaves when it encounters any HTML5
element, e.g. &lt;video&gt;. I think it may be worth revisiting the intention to
make &lt;device&gt; a

void element, so that some inner content can be rendered instead (like
&lt;video&gt;).


&gt;<i> As also mentioned above, in-page UI is harder if we force a particular
</I>style for &lt;device&gt; elements (a button or otherwise) on to developers.


We could make UI design easier by supporting a small set of CSS rules to
skin the &lt;device&gt; element.


&gt;<i> We've been looking at usability and user interface for &lt;device&gt; vs an
</I>async JS API and are finding better ways to make multiple async JS APIs work
in our interfaces than we are for &lt;device&gt; element-based authorizations.

&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> It would also be easier for prototyping if we didn't make assumptions on a
</I>&lt;device&gt; element. We can always jump to implementing a &lt;device&gt; element
later on but initially it might be good to prototype in JavaScript with
vendor API prefixes in preparation for a final standard approach.


The big strength of the &lt;device&gt; element, just like &lt;input type=file&gt;, is
that it requires a user click to bring up the authorisation dialog. I think
that it's a better approach to start with this tried-and-tested security
model and fix problems such as skinning, rather than to start with the a
Javascript API and add in a security model later.


Cheers


John

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I thought we were all trying to avoid asynchronous UI (dialogs,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This also removes the need for the&lt;device&gt;  element as has been mentioned

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you mean exactly by this? The usecases are pretty clear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It makes custom in-page UI harder, it does not prevent the need for

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was never under the impression we need to prevent the need for

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed. And, as I said earlier, I thought the goal was to try
