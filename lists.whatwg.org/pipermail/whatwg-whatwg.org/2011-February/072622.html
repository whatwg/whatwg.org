This isn't to say that you wouldn't want to prefetch a script, but I see that as more of a way to help the next page you'll navigate to by priming the cache vs. helping the currently loaded page.

</I>&gt;<i> In any event, it seems that rel=prefetch would have to change a lot vs. the changes to the script element to allow the same behavior.

</I>&gt;<i> Adding a &quot;required&quot; relationShip could be more appropriate way

Completely agree, your proposal seems better, probably easier to
implement and seem less prone to backward compatibility issues to me.

I believe it would be better to leave out the script tag and try to
obtain the same benefits by defining the correct &quot;rel&quot; on link
elements.

Having script access to the content of the HTTP resource is what is
really missing and seems to me would cover most of the presented
needs.

Maybe not completely related to script loading, but bubbling all
&quot;load&quot; events up to the document like Opera does would also help
authors in determining the correct timings (when to execute/use the
resource once it is fully loaded).
