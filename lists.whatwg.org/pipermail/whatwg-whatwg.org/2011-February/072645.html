</I>&gt;<i> From what I recall, they have a big file with nothing but function

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;execute&quot; (not actually execute any functions, but parse and declare those
</I>&gt;<i> functions into the global space). On the other hand, if they wrapped all the
</I>&gt;<i> code in /* .. */ comments, and had that single big comment &quot;parsed/executed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> by the engine, it went orders of magnitude faster (unsurprisingly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, it strongly suggests that the parsing/interpretation of the code was in

</I>&gt;<i> environment that slowed everything down.

Nope, execution is the culprit here, as function declarations are
actually executed code.  Saying &quot;function foo() { bar(); }&quot; is the
same as saying &quot;window.foo = function(){ bar(); };&quot; (module a few
irrelevant details).  The act of defining functions requires executing
functions (hidden behind the syntax of an operator, but still).

Solving this does require deferring execution entirely, like the GMail
Mobile team was able to do with the comment hack.
