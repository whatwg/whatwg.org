</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In my proposal (which was intended as a further refinement of Nicholas's),
execute would only be permitted once the network load completes, and throw
an exception if called before then.

 &gt; Is there a concrete alternate proposal that's worth building out instead?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If execute() must be synchronous, then readystate is not applicable.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, while it should be considered, it would probably take
</I>&gt;<i> longer to describe and has no corresponding markup semantics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
(I only suggested execute() being synchronous since it made sense in the
context of my proposal and it seemed like a useful, natural side-effect of
the rest of the proposal.)



&gt;<i> Glenn's point about noexecute  being a natural extension of defer and
</I>&gt;<i> async is a good one, however neither of those required changing onload
</I>&gt;<i> semantics or introducing a new event type.  Readystate on the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand is already a well-known concept. Moreover, if history is any
</I>&gt;<i> indication, we'll continue using it to implement deferred exec for
</I>&gt;<i> awhile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Note that I didn't mean to propose changing existing event semantics; I
simply forgot that script events already had an onload event that means
something entirely different than the one described by Progress Events.  The
&quot;finished loading from the network&quot; event would need to have a different
name.
