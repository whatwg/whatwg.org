<PRE>I had thought a bit about a new rel for &lt;link&gt;s, but always got caught up on the execute() method and how inappropriate it was for any other content types. It seemed weird to be able to call such a method on &lt;link&gt; to execute a script when &lt;script&gt;'s sole job is to execute scripts. If &lt;link&gt; then becomes capable of executing scripts, do we need &lt;script&gt;? 

If you can't get agreement to add a method on &lt;link&gt;, then we're back to possibly having a double-download situation, where you include the script via &lt;link&gt; and then need to create a dynamic &lt;script&gt; node to point to the same URL.

In the end it seemed that keeping &lt;script&gt; as the sole executor of scripts would be more likely agreed upon than augmenting &lt;link&gt; to do the same. It still seems like there would be more changes necessary for a &lt;link&gt; approach than a &lt;script&gt; approach, and I'm not sure it addresses backwards compatibility any better.

Once again, I expect the common case to be the script loader case, where &lt;script&gt; elements are created using JavaScript. In that case, there is zero impact on backwards compatibility when feature testing is used. The only backwards compatibility issue is when you use noexecute in markup, but a similar issue would occur using &lt;link&gt; in that case.

Completely agree, your proposal seems better, probably easier to
implement and seem less prone to backward compatibility issues to me.

I believe it would be better to leave out the script tag and try to
obtain the same benefits by defining the correct &quot;rel&quot; on link
elements.

Having script access to the content of the HTTP resource is what is
really missing and seems to me would cover most of the presented
needs.

Maybe not completely related to script loading, but bubbling all
&quot;load&quot; events up to the document like Opera does would also help
authors in determining the correct timings (when to execute/use the
resource once it is fully loaded).
