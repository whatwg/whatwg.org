</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of note, the big tv we had in 2000 (probably purchased circa 1998) at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a college communal area would display captions for the PIP window
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> below the PIP. So even TV vendors were aware that they didn't need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always stick captions into the box once they had reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sadly I don't think I've ever seen any TVs which would shrink the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primary window just to supply space for captions. There's no reason
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they couldn't, since they also do shrink the window to provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> onscreen menus or program guides.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suppose part of the reason with big TVs is an assumption that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audience will be at a fixed distance with or without captions, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shrinking the view area for the programming would cause the preferred
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distance to decrease. And as content providers actually do try to pick
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> areas which are mostly dead, the tradeoff of losing &quot;live pixels&quot; vs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decreasing optimal distance was not considered worth it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Classic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> TV required this (especially with overscan), but on modern TV's there  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> often a letterbox or pillarbox are that captions should go in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed. I'm pretty sure I saw a DVD playes which took advantage of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this with a letterbox and stuck the captions below the movie in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> January when I was in California.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IIUC, the YouTube's captions can be moved within the whole video
</I>&gt;<i> viewport which includes any letterboxing or pillarboxing if available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for moving them outside - that would turn the whole web page into a
</I>&gt;<i> potential drop zone for a div (or similar) coming from within a media
</I>&gt;<i> element. That would probably not make that much sense. But I could
</I>&gt;<i> imagine an application defining certain areas around the video - in
</I>&gt;<i> particular below and above it - as drop zones for captions/subtitles
</I>&gt;<i> and thus extend the on-screen space. I wonder what the browser vendors
</I>&gt;<i> think about that feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Silvia.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decent-sized computer screen, there is no real excuse for obscuring the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> video with the captions rather than putting them underneath or  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alongside.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yep. Well, it wouldn't be wrong for someone to write a 'Misery
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility mode' application to enable people to see how their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> captions would look on old TVs, but I don't think that's something for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which primary applications should be designed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
I've had the same idea. The rendering of captions is already defined as  
being on top of another element, namely the parent &lt;video&gt; element.  
Technically, I don't think it would be very difficult to allow the  
captions to be rendered into some other container. I think this kind of  
feature should wait until we have implementations of the current spec,  
though.
