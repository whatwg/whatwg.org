Somehow OpenSSL and NSS seem to solve that problem given that cryptographic
entropy is required to make HTTPS secure.  I'm certainly willing to believe
I've goofed it up, but I suspect it's not that much of a limitation these
days.

 However, I'm disinclined to wait on the basic best-effort PRNG for that to
&gt;<i> happen.

</I>
Given that we've missed IE9, we're talking about IE10 at the earliest.  If
history is a guide (which it might not be), that means we're talking about
something 2 years in the future.  If they're interested in supporting these
use cases, these APIs will (hopefully!) be long-stable by then.

It seems to me we (whatwg members, w3c members; browser vendors in general)
&gt;<i> need something more than IDL in the way of a spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok.  I'll write up a spec later today.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, but that approach does not provide any lower bounds on the quality of
the entropy.  If you keep running the PRNG, you'll eventually drain the
entropy pool.  It's an inescapable mathematical fact.  However, I agree that
it's a good best-effort design, and is precisely how arc4random works in Mac
OS X.

Apologies.  I'm subscribed to es-discuss under a different email address.
 I'll fix that shortly.


&gt;<i> As has already been discussed, since these issues are general EcmaScript

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually, that is precisely what we're discussing.  My suggestion is that we
do both: browsers implement a simple DOM-based API today that handles the
basic arc4random-like use case and TC39 go through whatever multi-month
(year?) process it likes and spec out whatever all-sing, all-dance crypto
library it likes.
