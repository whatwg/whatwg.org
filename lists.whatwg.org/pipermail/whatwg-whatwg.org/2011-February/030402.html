The problem with option B is that pages can't display correctly until
the load event fires, which can be quite late in the game what with
slow loading images and ads. It means that if you're on a page which
uses state, and reload the page, you'll first see the page in a
state-less mode while it's loading, and at some point later (generally
when the last image finishes loading) it'll &quot;snap&quot; to be in the state
it was when you pressed reload.

You'll get the same behavior going back to a state-using page which
has been kicked out of the fast-cache.
