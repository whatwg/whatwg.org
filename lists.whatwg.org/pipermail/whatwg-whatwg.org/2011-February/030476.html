As far as I can tell, /dev/urandom works great on all modern Unix-derived
operating systems (e.g., Mac, Linux, BSD, iOS, Android).  Windows since
Windows 2000 has CryptGenRandom:

Are there other operating systems you're worried about?


&gt;<i> However, I'm disinclined to wait on the basic best-effort PRNG for that to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would you be waiting for? Ignoring Ecma, just adding code to WebKit

</I>&gt;<i> Let's not assume :-/. My point is: to engage all the major browser vendors,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is another spec-worthy issue that IDL can't capture (and if we choose
</I>&gt;<i> one way, can't even express): the #ifdefs raise the question (which David
</I>&gt;<i> Wagner and I discussed briefly in private correspondence, and which I see
</I>&gt;<i> came up on the whatwg list already) of whether it is better to provide a
</I>&gt;<i> throwing stub when the OS randomness configury is not enabled, or better not
</I>&gt;<i> to provide an object-detectible method at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm inclined toward not providing a method that always throws. I've seen
</I>&gt;<i> too much fool's gold mislead developers. Bugs and throwing stubs underlying
</I>&gt;<i> detectible methods have led web developers to not just object-detect, but

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/jeresig/the-dom-is-a-mess-yahoo">http://www.slideshare.net/jeresig/the-dom-is-a-mess-yahoo</A> .) But testing
</I>&gt;<i> detectible methods for correctness further bloats downloaded JS and slows
</I>&gt;<i> first-run execution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok.  We can change the API to be like that, if you like.  In WebKit,
USE(OS_RANDOMNESS) is defined on virtually every port.  There might be some
ports that aren't covered (e.g., BeOS) though.


&gt;<i> Ok.  I'll write up a spec later today.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, that is precisely what we're discussing.  My suggestion is that

</I>&gt;<i> library it likes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There seems to be some spin here. What does &quot;today&quot; mean, and why the

</I>&gt;<i> Ecma? I hope you are not describing how quickly you can hack on WebKit code,
</I>&gt;<i> because while I can hack quickly on Mozilla code, that does not set the pace
</I>&gt;<i> of a standard, never mind make a new feature available cross-browser to web
</I>&gt;<i> developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe I misunderstood TC39's intentions.  My understanding is that your
aspirations include a full-featured crypto library, e.g., at the level of
complexity of OpenSSL rather than at the complexity of arc4random.
 Certainly designing and implementing such a feature is a longer-term
prospect.


&gt;<i> While it indeed takes years to produce new Ecma (ISO) specs, we on TC39
</I>&gt;<i> support early prototyping of harmonious proposals, so web developers can
</I>&gt;<i> start using such candidate features. But for this to work we need a
</I>&gt;<i> hand-shake on what is harmonious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the idea is to promulgate a de-facto standard via Chrome and let other
</I>&gt;<i> browsers reverse-engineer it, that can work, but it could backfire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If that were my intention, we wouldn't be having this discussion.


&gt;<i> Extending the old window.crypto object we added ages ago at Netscape may be
</I>&gt;<i> a good idea and a faster route to a high-quality cross-browser RBG. I won't
</I>&gt;<i> argue about that. My objection here is to your choice of words and the way
</I>&gt;<i> they might foreclose better cooperation among vendors: such an RBG API is
</I>&gt;<i> not done &quot;today&quot;, and it needs more than just one implementation to be a
</I>&gt;<i> standard other browsers will implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I chose my words poorly.  What I was trying to communicate is that I'd love
to see ECMAScript grow a beautiful crypto library that included lots of
useful tools, including HMACs, stream ciphers, PRNGs, etc.  TC39 is in a
massively better position to do that work than the whatwg.  However, at this
point in time, adding a simple source of cryptographic random numbers to
window.crypto is much simpler proposition (e.g., on the order of one day of
work).

Those sorts of APIs are implemented with what we call &quot;custom&quot; (read: slow)
bindings.
