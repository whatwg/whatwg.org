The main arguments for the readyState approach over this have been: it's
what IE does now, and the &quot;preloading when src is set&quot; has precedent with
images.

I sympathize with that, since they're aiming to improve the likelihood of
being implemented--but the precedent it's drawing on seems like a bad one,
which should be treated as a compatibility hack rather than a precedent for
new APIs.  From what you've been saying it sounds like it would have the
opposite effect, making it so hard to implement that it wouldn't gain
traction.

I also think the other side benefits of this approach are significant, so
long as they don't make it too hard to implement.  That really needs
implementor feedback--if you can give that, let me know if you want a more
detailed recap.
