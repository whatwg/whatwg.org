If I have a response set to no-cache and you make two requests for it 
but only one of those actually hits the server, then you're clearly 
caching it in violation of the no-cache header.  Is that really that 
unclear?

&gt;&gt;<i> Uh... In that situation I would expect the event handler to keep the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script alive until the load finishes. Anything else is just a bug that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exposes GC timing to the web page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've said the same thing to Will before. I agree that a script having a
</I>&gt;<i> circular reference to itself via the closure that's created when its
</I>&gt;<i> handler is created and assigned... *should* have kept the item alive and
</I>&gt;<i> not GC'd. I don't understand why IE GC's in this way.
</I>
Because it's the easy way to do it; we had to jump through some hoops in 
Gecko to make sure an async XHR stays alive until it fires its last 
readystate change event when no one is holding a ref to the XHR object.

&gt;<i> In any case, for all intents and purposes, for someone to be using the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;preloading&quot; as we're suggesting (with either proposal), you'd have to
</I>&gt;<i> keep around a reference to the script element anyway, so that you could
</I>&gt;<i> later programmatically execute it.
</I>
Well... no.  You could grab the ref in the onreadystatechange handler.
