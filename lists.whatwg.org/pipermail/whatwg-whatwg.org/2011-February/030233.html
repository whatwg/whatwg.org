I thought you said Webkit would refuse to implement that sort of behavior?

&gt;&gt;<i> This whole thing seems to me like an exercise in premature standardization.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Authors are using these features
</I>
Yes, I realize that.

&gt;<i> and they're implemented inconsistently.
</I>
Yes, I also realize that.  That's what it means that UAs are experimenting!

&gt;<i> If browsers are experimenting and you think there's
</I>&gt;<i> some chance that we'll eventually get a standardizable algorithm
</I>
I have no idea whether they will, because I'm still not sure what 
problems we're trying to solve here...

 &gt; then I don't see why the new algorithm can't use a new prefixed name 
while
&gt;<i> we reserve the legacy names for legacy-compatible behavior.
</I>
Compatible with what legacy?  We have at least 4 different legacies 
here, right?

&gt;<i>  From what WebKit and Opera people have told me, innerText is necessary
</I>&gt;<i> for web-compat for non-Gecko browsers.  There are sites out there that
</I>&gt;<i> use textContent if they sniff Firefox, and innerText otherwise.
</I>
That's really unfortunate (esp. if they actually sniff for &quot;Firefox&quot;).  :(

&gt;<i> innerText apparently can't be exactly the same as textContent --
</I>&gt;<i> Maciej said that &quot;I know that if&lt;br&gt;  doesn't produce newlines, stuff
</I>&gt;<i> will break&quot;
</I>
But the &quot;Firefox&quot; path takes the textContent and does its own newline 
processing or something?

&gt;<i> and Opera does add extra newlines for&lt;br&gt;  (but doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem to change much else).
</I>
I could live with an innerText that was textContent but converted &lt;br&gt; 
to newline, I guess...

&gt;<i> I'm slightly less sure about Selection.toString(), but I'd be inclined
</I>&gt;<i> to take the same general approach.  It's much better for authors to
</I>&gt;<i> have to code around browsers not offering them enough features than to
</I>&gt;<i> code around browsers offering them incompatible features.  At least
</I>&gt;<i> then they only have to do the coding work once.
</I>
I still think it'll really confuse authors that Selection.toString() 
won't do the same thing as copying.  But maybe I overestimate the 
problems it would cause....
