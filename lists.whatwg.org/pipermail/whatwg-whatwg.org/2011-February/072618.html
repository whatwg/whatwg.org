Again, you're assuming that the &quot;optimization&quot; that needs to happen is 
that same for all browsers....

&gt;&gt;<i> Assuming the browser does the parsing on the main thread, yes? What if

</I>&gt;<i> Regardless of what thread the processing is on, if the parsing happens

If the hardware is overwhelmed.  On the other hand, if it's a multicore 
chip (which is what mobile hardware is shipping with nowadays) and the 
page-load is gated on one core, there's no reason to not be parsing on 
another core...

&gt;<i> The major problem in the mobile-performance part of the use-case is
</I>&gt;<i> around parsing. Noone is suggesting here that the web author should have
</I>&gt;<i> a .parse() function where they deterministically control it and handcuff

</I>
OK, good.

&gt;<i> What we're suggesting is that we be able to directly
</I>&gt;<i> control execution, and in so doing, make an indirect hint to the browser
</I>&gt;<i> that it should also strongly consider deferring the parsing.
</I>
That sounds fine to me.
