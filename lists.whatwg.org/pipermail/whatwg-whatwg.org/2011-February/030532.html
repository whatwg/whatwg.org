IIUC, the YouTube's captions can be moved within the whole video
viewport which includes any letterboxing or pillarboxing if available.

As for moving them outside - that would turn the whole web page into a
potential drop zone for a div (or similar) coming from within a media
element. That would probably not make that much sense. But I could
imagine an application defining certain areas around the video - in
particular below and above it - as drop zones for captions/subtitles
and thus extend the on-screen space. I wonder what the browser vendors
think about that feature.

Cheers,
Silvia.


&gt;&gt;<i> On a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decent-sized computer screen, there is no real excuse for obscuring the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> video with the captions rather than putting them underneath or alongside.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep. Well, it wouldn't be wrong for someone to write a 'Misery
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility mode' application to enable people to see how their
</I>&gt;<i> captions would look on old TVs, but I don't think that's something for
</I>&gt;<i> which primary applications should be designed.
