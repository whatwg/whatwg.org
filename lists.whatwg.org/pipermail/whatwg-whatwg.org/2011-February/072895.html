First of all, which two proposals are we talking about here?

</I>
It would certainly make implementing it soon unlikely, if such a beastie 
is needed.

&gt;<i> For #2 (and several other related questions we've been exploring)...

</I>
That's an excellent question.  Is that the correct thing?

For some things (e.g. stylesheets and images) browsers don't do this in 
many cases (and the HTML5 spec in fact requires such behavior).  What 
should the script behavior be?

&gt;<i> isn't that still feasible within the constraints of either of the two main proposals?
</I>
Sure.

My point was that coalescing loads in ways that HTTP doesn't actually 
allow is one way to handle the memory growth issue without exploding 
cache complexity.

&gt;<i> Also, I want to go back to a question I asked earlier in this thread and
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think I quite got a full answer to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to the HTTP caching semantics (or other related performance

</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't imply? I'm trying to figure out why &quot;preloading&quot; presents
</I>&gt;<i> additional challenges/risks that the current dynamic loading mechanisms

</I>
Because if you're trying to implement some sort of &quot;sophisticated 
in-memory content-uniqueness cache&quot; is also expected to implement HTTP 
semantics, that makes implementing it a good bit more difficult.
