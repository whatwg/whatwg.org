Think 10,000 &lt;script&gt; elements all pointing to the same 25KB script.  If 
you're forced to preload the script at src-set time, that's 25MB of data.

And if the argument is that the scripts can share the data, I don't see 
what guarantees that.  Doing that while obeying HTTP semantics might be 
pretty difficult if you don't have very low-level control over your 
network layer.

&gt;<i> but somehow they avoided that flaw in IE, where it should be killing them.
</I>
Who says they avoided it in IE?

Who says they're running the same code in IE and other browsers, for 
that matter?

&gt;&gt;<i> You're assuming scripts mean to do everything they do. That's not a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's what I'm assuming: more than not, this feature will be used

</I>
Sure.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't worry about the edge cases.  It 
might be we decide to ignore them, after careful consideration.  But we 
should consider them.

&gt;<i> I haven't seen any examples of existing sites where the &quot;millions of
</I>&gt;<i> script nodes&quot; phenomena is happening right now, which would be potential
</I>&gt;<i> landmines for this newly suggested &quot;preloading&quot; functionality. The fear
</I>&gt;<i> of it being theoretically possible seems much more intense than any
</I>&gt;<i> evidence or logical reasoning for it being probable.
</I>
I've seen sites creating tens of thousands of script nodes, certainly, 
and then screwing something up (I know the latter because we got bug 
reports about it).  If I find the relevant bugs I'll post them here, but 
honestly that's a low priority for me right now.

&gt;<i> I also am on record as saying that I think it's a bad idea to avoid a
</I>&gt;<i> useful (to some) feature for fears that others (probably the minority)
</I>&gt;<i> will abuse or misuse it.
</I>
Yes, and I'm on record saying that I need to think about my users and 
protecting them from the minority of incompetent or malicious web 
developers.  We just have slightly different goals here.

&gt;<i> To my knowledge, that process worked ok, and I think it's a decent model for going forward.
</I>
Just to be clear, that process, on our end, was a huge engineering-time 
sink.  Several man-months were wasted on it.  We would very much like to 
avoid having to repeat that experience if at all possible.

And yes, as you said, it worked &quot;ok&quot; in the sense that sites were fixed. 
  It could have gone much worse.

&gt;<i> Unless someone can show that the majority of sites (or even just
</I>&gt;<i> something greater than a tiny fraction) are going to choke. And if that
</I>&gt;<i> can be shown, I welcome it. But I'd also be extremely curious as to how
</I>&gt;<i> those same sites are (probably) surviving fine in IE, which has been
</I>&gt;<i> doing this preloading for a decade or more.
</I>
Does IE obey HTTP semantics for the preloads?  Has anyone does some 
really careful testing of IE's actual behavior here?
