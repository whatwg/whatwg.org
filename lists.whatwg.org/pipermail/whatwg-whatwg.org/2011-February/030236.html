<PRE>Hi again,

Just want to wake this thread up and say that I still see CORS as a
good fit for this use case, and I'm curious Jonas about what you think
in light of my previous post?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't &#160;fully understand your emphasis on the implied semantics of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CORS request. You say it *only* means a site can read the response. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't see that in the draft spec. Cross-origin XHR may have been the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> big motivation behind CORS, but the mechanisms described in the spec
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appear agnostic with regard to use cases and the abstract section
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems to invite additional use cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The spec does say what the meaning of the Access-Contol-Allow-Origin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> header means. You're trying to modify that meaning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A strangely existential statement :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consider things from a web authors point of view. The author develops
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a website, bunnies.com, which contains a HTML page which performs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same-site, and thus trusted, XHR requests. The HTML page additionally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exposes an API based on postMessage to allow parent frames to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicate with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since the site exposes various useful HTTP APIs it further has adds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: &lt;origin&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a set of the URLs on the site. Including the url of the static HTML
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page. This is per CORS safe since the HTML page is static there is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information leakage that doesn't happen through a normal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server-to-server request anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, with the modification you are proposing, an attacker site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could forever pin this page the users app-cache. This means that if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is a security bug in the page, the attacker site could exploit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that security problem forever since any javascript in the page will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to run in the security context of bunnies.com. So all of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sudden the CORS headers that the site added has now had a severe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security impact.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's why I'm hampering on the semantics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another issue is that if a site *is* willing to allow resources to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pinned in the app-cache of another site, it might still not be willing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to share the contents of those resources with everyone. If we reuse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the existing CORS headers to express &quot;is allowed to be app-cache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pinned&quot;, then we can't satisfy that use case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example a website could create a HTML page which embeds a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user-specific key and exposes a postMessage based API for third party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sites to encrypt/decrypt content using that users key. To allow this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to happen for off-line apps it wants to allow the HTML page to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pinned in a third party app-cache. But it doesn't want to expose the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actual key to the third party sites. If CORS was used to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cache-pinning, this wouldn't be possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do appreciate the using CORS for this feels like blurring the lines
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> between two different things. &#160;I wonder if there should be additional
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> request/response headers in CORS to convey the intended &quot;use&quot; of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> resource and whether that particular &quot;use&quot; is allowed?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If not CORS, what mechanism would you suggest to allow HTTPS resources
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from another origin to be including in a cache manifest file? Any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> means for the 'other' origin to opt in will suite my needs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't really care if this is part of CORS spec or not, but it needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be different headers than Access-Control-Allow-Origin to avoid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overloading the meaning of that header, and thus the effect of adding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The header-value should probably include some sort of limit on how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long the resource is allowed to be cached, and maybe there should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways that the site can signal that a given url should be used as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fallback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think these two requirements add unnecessary complexity, and in the
</I>&gt;<i> use case that brought me here, &quot;as a fallback&quot; is definitely not
</I>&gt;<i> desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, I'm not so convinced that pinning in an appcache is much
</I>&gt;<i> different than providing &quot;read access&quot;. Such cross origin resources
</I>&gt;<i> are available to be loaded as subresources into main pages using that
</I>&gt;<i> particular appcache, only in the context of the manfest file's origin.
</I>&gt;<i> They don't escape beyond that boundary. Looks a lot like a form of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;read access&quot; extended to the offline case.
