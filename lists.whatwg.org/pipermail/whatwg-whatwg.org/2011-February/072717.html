This proposition is mostly trying to fix a user experience issue: when
you have to type a text limited to a given number of characters and at
some point you just can't type anymore because you reached this limit,
it's really frustrating because you have to constantly remove some text,
type until you reach the limit, remove some text again...
It seems much more interesting to use the constraint validation
mechanism we already have to tell the user that the text is actually
limited to X characters. With that system, the user will be able to type
it's entire text and then easily reduce it to the desired size.
Think about how annoying twitter.com would be if the users were not able
to type when the text field has reached 140 characters.

Though, this might not be really helpful for text field which aren't
expecting a long text. If this is an issue, maybe we could go for
Aryeh's suggestion for &lt;input&gt; [1] and do that one for &lt;textarea&gt; only?
But it might be confusing.

[1] UA shouldn't allow the the text length to be greater than the
maxlength value (and assume that the element can't suffer from being too
long).
