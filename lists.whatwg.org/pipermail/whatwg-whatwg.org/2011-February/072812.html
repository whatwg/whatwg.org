<PRE>Hi Anne,

</I>&gt;<i> This is just a thought. Instead of acquiring a Stream object asynchronously

</I>&gt;<i> navigator.cameraStream. It also inherits from EventTarget. Then on the
</I>&gt;<i> Stream object you have methods to request camera access which triggers some

</I>
I thought we were all trying to avoid asynchronous UI (dialogs,
infobars, popups, etc), which is a solution that does not scale very
well when many different APIs require it. This was one of the main
reasons for trying a different approach.

&gt;<i> Once granted an appropriately named event is dispatched on
</I>&gt;<i> Stream indicating you now have access to an actual stream. When the user
</I>&gt;<i> decides it is enough and turns of the camera (or something else happens)
</I>&gt;<i> some other appropriately named event is dispatched on Stream again turning
</I>&gt;<i> it transparent black again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This also removes the need for the &lt;device&gt; element as has been mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> off-list. Basically, the idea was that &lt;device&gt; does not really help anyone.
</I>
What do you mean exactly by this? The usecases are pretty clear.

&gt;<i> It makes custom in-page UI harder, it does not prevent the need for
</I>&gt;<i> scripting, and it does not help with fallback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was never under the impression we need to prevent the need for
scripting. Why is that a goal?

&gt;<i> This is somewhat weird though :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed. And, as I said earlier, I thought the goal was to try
something else than asynchronous permission dialogs. What has changed?

Thanks,
Andrei
