You're describing issues with background multitasking, which is a  
different thing.

iOS fully supports multi-threading in all applications (and did so in  
versions which didn't officially support multi-tasking), and Apple  
supports and keeps extending that functionality, e.g., added Grand Central  
Dispatch in iOS4, which gives iOS multi-threading &amp; multi-core support on  
par with Mac OS X.

Single-threaded OSes, even on mobiles, are thing of the past. On platforms  
on which modern web apps are usable today, multi-threading is possible.  
With multi-core chipsets coming out, it might soon become a necessity!

&gt;<i> You're also ignoring the fact that there are several other documented  
</I>&gt;<i> use-cases for execution-deferral that are not related to mobile (or  
</I>&gt;<i> multi-threading) at all. That maybe the 80% use-case for this proposal,  
</I>&gt;<i> but it's certainly not the only reason we want and need a feature like  
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>
Could you list those issues or point me where these issues are documented?
