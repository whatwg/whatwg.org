Right.

&gt;<i> I dunno if

Most users will call continuously increasing memory (which is what you'd 
get if a page creates script elements, sets src, and then doesn't insert 
them, perhaps by accident) a memory leak.

&gt;<i> How much memory does a 25k JavaScript file take up while sitting in this

</I>
It depends.  In Gecko right now it's probably about 25k, but it might be 
50k if conversion to UTF16 happens earlier, and so forth.

&gt;<i> or is it a lot more? Compared to the 100-300
</I>&gt;<i> MB of memory that a Firefox instance takes up on my computer, what
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of that would be (or would be increased) if Firefox were also
</I>&gt;<i> holding onto even a large amount (~200k) of not-yet-used JavaScript code

</I>
My worries are cases where a page inadvertently makes you hold on to 
tens or hundreds of megabytes of js, not about the 200k case.

&gt;<i> Also, we have to consider whether the intended usage of this feature, by
</I>&gt;<i> developers, is to unnecessarily waste bandwidth and memory and never use
</I>&gt;<i> the scripts, or if it's in good-faith to eventually use them. Does that
</I>&gt;<i> mean there will never be any memory waste? No. But I don't think it'll
</I>&gt;<i> be the norm, at least based on the interested parties in this discussion.
</I>
I think you understimate how often scripts just have bugs in them.  I'm 
not saying someone would create a few million nodes and then not insert 
them in the DOM because they're _trying_ to do something dumb.  But that 
sort of thing scripts do all the time.

&gt;<i> I'd venture to guess that right now, there's a pretty small amount of
</I>&gt;<i> code out there which is creating script elements en masse but not
</I>&gt;<i> appending them to the DOM. Can't imagine really what that use-case would
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>
You're assuming scripts mean to do everything they do.  That's not a 
good assumption, unfortunately.
