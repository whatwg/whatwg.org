</I>&gt;<i> on adding script tags through markup (like with document.write() I guess?)
</I>&gt;<i> rather than just using dynamic script elements.
</I>
I'm not sure why you are narrowing the scope to &quot;script loaders&quot;? (I
imagine you're referring to js-libraries which help with loading
scripts faster?)

My idea was that webservers would output the above markup directly,
avoiding the need to go through special libraries at all.

&gt;&gt;<i> Though of course, if people think that using readystate is enough then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we can flesh out that solution too. We'd have to require that UAs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start downloading the script as soon as .src is set, and that events
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fire at reasonable points in time, like when the script has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, as I said earlier in the thread, I think we'd need to consider changing
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;may&quot; wording in the current spec language to &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot;. And
</I>&gt;<i> then we'd have to consider giving some basic framework language for an event
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism. Technically, the &quot;preloading&quot; event mechanism isn't strictly
</I>&gt;<i> necessary, but it's quite useful for several things you can't do without it,
</I>&gt;<i> and so I really don't think it's worth adjusting the spec without also
</I>&gt;<i> adding that part in.
</I>
I'm not quite sure I follow you here. What I was thinking was that we
say that implementations MUST (in the rfc 2119 sense) start loading
the script immediately.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think that we couldn't use the 'load' event has that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might break existing pages which rely on 'load' not firing until the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script has executed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, &quot;load&quot; is a binary one-time event, and thus not suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> overloading for this purpose. &quot;readyState&quot; is much more suitable since it
</I>&gt;<i> defines a progression of states. XHR already makes good use of defining such
</I>&gt;<i> an event mechanism, and so there's precedent to draw from here. In the case
</I>&gt;<i> of preloading for scripts, there's probably just two states necessary:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;uninitialized&quot; and &quot;complete&quot;. Haven't seen any use-cases for which any
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate states (like &quot;loading&quot;) would be useful, as they are in XHR.
</I>
Sure, but we'd also want to fire some event once the script has been
fully downloaded so that the page doesn't have to use a timer and poll
to figure out when the download is done.
