<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I follow you here. My idea for option A is that you never
</I>&gt;<i> get a popstate when doing the initial parsing of a page.
</I>
Okay, I may still have misunderstood, despite my best efforts!  :)

&gt;<i> Option B:
</I>&gt;<i> Fire popstates as we currently do, with the caveat that you never
</I>&gt;<i> fire a stale popstate -- that is, if any navigations or
</I>&gt;<i> push/replaceStates have occurred since you queued the task to fire the
</I>&gt;<i> popstate, don't fire it.
</I>
Is my option B clear?  It's also what the patch I have [1] does.

We'd might want to make popstate sync again, since otherwise you have
to schedule a task which synchronously checks if no state changes have
occurred, and dispatches popstate only if appropriate.
I know Olli has some thoughts on making popstate sync, and fwiw, FF
currently dispatches it synchronously.

&gt;<i> The main problem with this proposal is that it's a big change from
</I>&gt;<i> what the API is today. However it's only a change in the situation
</I>&gt;<i> when the spec today calls for firing popstate during the initial page
</I>&gt;<i> load. Something that it seems like pages don't deal with properly
</I>&gt;<i> today anyway, at least in the case of facebook.
</I>
Given the adoption the feature has seen, I guess I'd favor a smaller
change.  In particular, the option B above makes it possible to write
correct pages without ever reading the DOM &quot;current state&quot; property --
it's there only as an optimization to allow pages to set their state
faster, so no rush to put it in Right Away.  In contrast, a correct
page with option A would have to check its state at some point as it
loads.

I guess I don't see why it's better to make a big change than a small
one, if they both work equally well.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Proposal B has the advantage of requiring fewer changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The more I think about this, the more I like this option. &#160;It's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller change than option A (though again, we certainly could expose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the state object through a DOM property separately from this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal), and I think it would be sufficient to fix some sites which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are currently broken. &#160;(For instance, I've gotten Facebook to receive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stale popstates and show me the wrong page just by clicking around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quickly.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, this avoids the edge case in option B of &quot;you don't get a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popstate on the initial initial load, but you do get a popstate if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're reloading from far enough back in the session history, or after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a session restore.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I follow you here. My idea for option A is that you never
</I>&gt;<i> get a popstate when doing the initial parsing of a page. So if you're
</I>&gt;<i> reloading from session restore or if you're going far back enough in
</I>&gt;<i> history that you end up parsing a Document, you never get a popstate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You get a popstate when and only when you transition between two
</I>&gt;<i> history entries while remaining on the same Document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the basic code flow would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever creating a part of the UI (for example during page load or if
</I>&gt;<i> called upon to render a new AJAX page), use document.currentState to
</I>&gt;<i> decide what state to render.
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever you receive a popstate, rerender UI as described by the popstate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So no edge cases that I can think of?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main problem with this proposal is that it's a big change from
</I>&gt;<i> what the API is today. However it's only a change in the situation
</I>&gt;<i> when the spec today calls for firing popstate during the initial page
</I>&gt;<i> load. Something that it seems like pages don't deal with properly
</I>&gt;<i> today anyway, at least in the case of facebook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was concerned that pages might become confused when they don't get a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popstate they were expecting -- for instance, if you pushState before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the initial popstate, a page may never see a popstate event -- but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think this might not be such a big deal. &#160;A call to push/replaceState
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would almost certainly be accompanied by code updating the DOM to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new state. &#160;Popstate's main purpose is to tell me to update the DOM,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I don't think I'd be missing much by not getting it in that case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was my thinking too FWIW.
