The last dozen or two messages were regarding your rabbit hole, which
raised serious issues.

&gt;<i>  c) does this run the risk of going afoul of the same issue that tripped of Firefox with their synchronous execution of inline script elements (that jQuery used for global-eval)?
</I>
I don't know how an opt-in API that doesn't yet exist and which nobody
is using can run afoul of existing code, so you'll need to be more
specific.

&gt;&gt;<i> I sympathize with that, since they're aiming to improve the likelihood of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which should be treated as a compatibility hack rather than a precedent for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new APIs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly disagree with this characterization, based solely on the fact that the wording of the current spec already says to do exactly as I'm proposing. That's not a &quot;compatibility hack&quot;, that's further standardizing the wisdom that the spec writers already thought through and codified.
</I>
There's no need to load images that aren't in the DOM, since you can
simply add them to a hidden container in the document.  Loading images
that aren't in any document avoids breaking existing pages--a
compatibility hack.  It's odd to assume, in an architecture bogged
down in so much backwards-compatibility, that everything it does is
good precedent.

&gt;<i> Preloading of stylesheets is already supported in at least Gecko. &#160;Just mark them as disabled (or an alternate stylesheet not in the main set, which is the same thing in effect) and the sheet will be loaded+parsed but not applied. &#160;Which is presumably what you mean by stylesheet preloading?
</I>
Hmm.  Here's a related idea:

- Add an &quot;onfetch&quot; event, when the fetch completes (put aside the
question of this vs. onreadystatechange for now).
- Add a &quot;noexecute&quot; attribute.  When true, the &quot;execute a script
block&quot; steps set an internal &quot;pending-execution&quot; flag and aborts.
This is done at the start of the &quot;If the load was successful&quot;
subsection.
- If the &quot;noexecute&quot; attribute is changed, and the &quot;pending-execution&quot;
flag is true, clear the &quot;pending-execution&quot; flag and queue a task to
run &quot;execute a script block&quot;.
- The &quot;pending-execution&quot; flag is not propagated to clones, but always
set to false.

Put more roughly: set &quot;noexecute&quot; to preload the script, and clear it
to execute it.

The implications of this:

- Scripts still receive onerror on fetch errors (&quot;for example a DNS
error, or an HTTP 404 error&quot;), even if noexecute is set.  That is, you
can detect network errors without executing the script.
- Scripts can still only be executed once, regulated by the &quot;already
started&quot; flag.
- Capturing &quot;error&quot; on window can still be used to capture all error
events.  (Fetching scripts without them being in any document breaks
this, which is a serious problem with the other proposals.)
- Once a node has had its &quot;already started&quot; flag set, the &quot;prepare a
script&quot; steps never run on it again, even if the node is cloned.
Clearing the &quot;pending-execution&quot; flag follows this, preventing an
already-prepared script from being executed twice when cloned.
- For feature detection:
typeof(document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;).noexecute) == &quot;boolean&quot;.
