Yeah, I'd be quite happy to not have &lt;device&gt; at all.

&gt;<i> This is somewhat weird though :-)

that is much closer to how i'd want things to work. although from my
perspective, i don't know that we need to send many events. I don't
see a significant difference between a user with a camera covered by a
black tile, or a camera perpetually pointed at a white wall. If the
user wants to move where the camera points, that's up to the user, and
the app will notice that there's more data streaming.

I think it's sufficient for a UA to inform the user that &lt;this page&gt;
is streaming this &lt;black region&gt; and to allow the user to adjust the
&quot;virtual camera&quot; to point at something else, out through the fourth
wall at the user, out the window, at some other device, at a video
file, etc.
