I was responding to Nicholas's change, since based on his example code I'm
pretty sure he expected it to be synchronous.

Basically, the suggestion is that `preload` is how a web author can force
&gt;<i> the browser from its hinted &quot;you may preload&quot; to &quot;you must preload&quot;. I think
</I>&gt;<i> this has the potential for confusion. It's like saying &quot;If I set a script
</I>&gt;<i> element to `async`, it will definitely be asynchronous, but if I don't set
</I>&gt;<i> it to `async`, then it may or may not be asynchronous, I'm just not sure.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The same confusion would be true of &quot;defer&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;, and a whole host of
</I>&gt;<i> other attributes/properties on HTML elements that come to mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think it's confusing, but I also don't know why anyone would want to
set preload to false.

Between the readyState proposal and the current preload proposal (with no
execute method), I prefer readyState.  The execute method was the critical
difference between the two proposals; removing it essentially changed his
proposal into a minor variation of yours.
