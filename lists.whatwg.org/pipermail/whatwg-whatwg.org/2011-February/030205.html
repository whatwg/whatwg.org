Oops, fixed. I often forget to updated examples and introductory text, 
that's why I tend to wait until a section is stable before adding them.

</I>&gt;<i> even if you do want it without a message &quot;data:&quot; does the job.
</I>
The idea is just to make the parsing trivial. It's error-handling.

Why is that simpler?

I think one could argue simplicity either way. Either it's simpler because 
you just keep adding to the name until you get to the end up the line or a 
colon, or it's simpler because there are fewer possible error conditions.

The advantage of making a colon-less line be valid is that we can later 
introduce boolean-style flags that don't take a value and they would work 
the same way, but not need a colon.

</I>
&quot;foo&quot; is a valid event type name. In fact as far as I can tell, DOM3 
Events no longer restricts event type names at all. I've removed that step 
to make it less confusing.


&gt;<i> However, if the event name were for example &quot;click&quot;, then this would be 
</I>&gt;<i> okay and the following step would be taken:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;If the event name buffer has a value other than the empty string, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;change the type of the newly created event to equal the value of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;event name buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few questions about this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  Does this mean that a click event would be fired on the EventSource 
</I>&gt;<i> object, such as that onclick would be called?
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> 2)  Why the limitation of events only in the DOM Events spec? It seems 
</I>&gt;<i> that most of those events are irrelevant in the context of a non-UI part 
</I>&gt;<i> of the page.
</I>
The limitation was on valid event type names, because it used to be that 
you couldn't e.g. use a space in an event type name. This restriction 
seems to have been removed.


&gt;<i> 3)  Assuming I've understood the current spec correctly, what is the use 
</I>&gt;<i> case for named events?
</I>
It's so that you can categorise your events, e.g. have a 'stock-up' event 
and a 'stock-down' event, and then use the event registration mechanism to 
hook different event listeners up.

No, it fires the event with the custem event name. &quot;onmessage&quot; only fires 
for events with the name &quot;message&quot;.

Yeah, I'm waiting for CORS to be more stable.

</I>&gt;<i> Just a quick question about the Last-Event-ID header. The spec currently

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;If the event source's last event ID string is not the empty string, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;then a Last-Event-ID HTTP header must be included with the request,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the following scenario: a connection is established and one of

</I>&gt;<i> Last-Event-ID: foo is sent per the spec. The next stream of events

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question is whether or not Last-Event-ID: foo should be sent a

</I>
Yes, it should be sent a second time.

</I>
I've changed the EventSource spec to make 204 abort, along with all other 
2xx codes other than 200 with the right type. I don't know what I was 
thinking there.

javascript: has Content-Type text/html, and about:blank has no 
Content-Type, so those are already handled.

</I>
This should be fixed in the browsers, IMHO. The first script is always 
used in legacy APIs except for XHR, as far as I can tell.

(If I'm wrong, much more should change than EventSource.)

I haven't changed the spec here, because I really think it makes more 
sense to be consistent with the bulk of the platform here. Let's leave XHR 
as the aberration...
