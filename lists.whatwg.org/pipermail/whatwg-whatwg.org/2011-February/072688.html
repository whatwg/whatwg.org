It sounds like you're saying that, if the user's full-page zoom level is
110% and the page requests a 100x100 canvas, the browser should create a
110x110 backing store instead.  There are several problems with that:

- The full-zoom level can be changed by the user after the canvas is already
rendered.  If I load a page at 100%, the canvas renders at that resolution,
and then I change the full-zoom level to 110%, there's no way for the
browser to know this and use a bigger backing store in advance.
- The data would have to be downscaled to the exposed 100x100 resolution
when exported with ImageData.  This means that retrieving, modifying and
re-importing ImageData would be lossy.  Similarly, rendering a 100x100 image
into a canvas set to 100x100 would upscale the image, blurring it: the
developer should be able to expect that blitting a 100x100 image into a
100x100 canvas will be a 1:1 copy.
- If, rather than displaying it in the document at the full-zoom level, the
data is sent to the server, the results would be blurry.  For example, if I
create a 1000x1000 canvas (and the browser's backing store is actually
1100x1100), and I send the finished data to the server (at the exposed
1000x1000), the browser has to resample the final image, blurring it.

If that's not what you meant, could you clarify?

 I went to books.google.com, opened up the first book in my library, and
&gt;<i> zoomed in, and it reflowed and rerendered the text to be quite crisp. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see any problem here. Images were similiarly handled beautifully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on the steps to reproduce this problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
(I tried this, and text was blurry even when I zoomed using only that page's
built-in zoom mechanism; it seemed to be scaling the rendered page and not
rerendering text at all.  I figured some books might not be OCR'd so I tried
another couple books, but it still happened; then it somehow crashed FF3, so
I gave up.)
