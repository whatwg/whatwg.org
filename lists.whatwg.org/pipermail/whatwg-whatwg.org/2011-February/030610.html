That's a violation of HTTP semantics, yes.  A convenient way to write 
the code, but a violation of HTTP semantics.

&gt;<i> Again, maybe I'm missing something, but the way Will describes it sounds
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly reasonable to me. It might be slightly on the aggressive side,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't see how that, as described, is violating the HTTP caching
</I>&gt;<i> semantics.
</I>
Trivially.  If it's not in your cache at all, you're supposed to make a 
request to the server!  If you're not doing that, then you're not 
implementing HTTP.

&gt;<i> I don't see that those semantics imply that a browser must
</I>&gt;<i> wait to fully receive response-headers from a first request before
</I>&gt;<i> deciding what to do with a second request of the same URL.
</I>
Right.  They just imply that you need to send the second request.  Or 
wait for the first to come and then decide whether to send it.  Or 
_something_ that looks like what HTTP is supposed to look like.

What _this_ looks like is that there's a non-HTTP cache of in-progress 
loads that can serve to coalesce said in-progress loads.  That gives 
behavior that's invalid per HTTP and inherently racy in a bad way.

&gt;&gt;<i> Because it's the easy way to do it; we had to jump through some hoops
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in Gecko to make sure an async XHR stays alive until it fires its last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> readystate change event when no one is holding a ref to the XHR object.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but in that case, the XHR object has a circular reference to
</I>&gt;<i> itself via the closure of the handler function (assuming it was an
</I>&gt;<i> assigned anonymous or in-scope function that was assigned).
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i> I was just saying that in the case of actual DOM elements, when a circular
</I>&gt;<i> reference is created between the DOM element and a JS counter-part,
</I>&gt;<i> through the closure of a handler assigned to the element, I assumed this
</I>&gt;<i> was enough to avoid GC.
</I>
Circular references can't be enough to avoid GC.  The whole point of 
having a GC is to be able to collect entire subgraphs of the object 
graph that are not rooted.  And you have to be able to collect cyclic 
subgraphs; otherwise you might as well use reference counting instead of 
a GC.

&gt;<i> I recall in older IE days avoiding stuff like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> var script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> script.theobj = script;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because this created a circular reference, and thus a memory-leak, if
</I>&gt;<i> you didn't forcibly unset before unload the `theobj` reference to break
</I>&gt;<i> the circular ref.
</I>
Yes, that would be due to the fact that GC was used on the JS side and 
&quot;something else&quot; on the C++ side and the expando caused the script to be 
a GC root.  Other browsers have had similar bugs too.  Those are just 
bugs to fix.  A GC should be able to collect the above.

&gt;&gt;<i> Well... no. You could grab the ref in the onreadystatechange handler.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the most rudimentary of cases, and only assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> `onreadystatechange` handler actually had a closure reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> script element...
</I>
|<i>this| is the script element in the onreadystatechange handler, I would 
</I>think.  So it _always_ has a reference to the script element.  Just like 
the XHR onreadystatechange case.

&gt;<i> he can't just daisy-chain off the handlers, he needs to actually have a
</I>&gt;<i> reference kept for each script element, so that he can specifically
</I>&gt;<i> execute each one in their proper order.
</I>
Yes, but it could just grab those references as the scripts load.  In 
any way, this is a side-issue; my main question has been answered: IE 
both shows bad memory behavior _and_ fails to implement HTTP semantics 
for script preloads done in this way.
