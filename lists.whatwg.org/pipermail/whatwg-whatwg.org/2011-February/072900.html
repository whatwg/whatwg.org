The api of #2 seems somewhat cleaner to me.

#1 seems safer to implement.

I'm not sure which one I prefer...

&gt;&gt;<i> It would certainly make implementing it soon unlikely, if such a beastie
</I>&gt;<i> is needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that's the crux of the question. Is such a mechanism needed to
</I>&gt;<i> make either of those two proposals something palatable to a browser like
</I>&gt;<i> Mozilla?
</I>
I don't think we'd need anything like this for proposal #1 above.  For 
#2, I'm not sure yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> For some things (e.g. stylesheets and images) browsers don't do this in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many cases (and the HTML5 spec in fact requires such behavior). What
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should the script behavior be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me restate: I'm not purporting to know what the semantics should or
</I>&gt;<i> should not be. I'm suggesting they should be, per browser, exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> same as normal dynamic script loading, in each browser, already behaves.
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, I've been operating under the assumption that neither
</I>&gt;<i> proposal requires explicitly defining or changing the current HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> caching semantics. I'm hoping that if this assumption is wrong, someone
</I>&gt;<i> can help me understand why?
</I>
This assumption is not wrong, per se.

&gt;<i> I don't understand why the preloading specifically would imply different
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP caching semantics than normal dynamic script loading?
</I>
It doesn't have to.  It's just that if preloading is easy to trigger by 
accident and authors don't notice when they accidentally preload lots of 
stuff then we may have a problem if we don't coalesce identical-object 
(whatever that means) loads.

Normal script loading doesn't have the &quot;don't notice&quot; issue much, 
because a typical script running is noticeable.
