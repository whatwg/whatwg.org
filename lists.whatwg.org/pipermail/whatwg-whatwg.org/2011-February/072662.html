oops, right, but i don't know that that complicates things much. you
just store a list of variables to pollute window with when &lt;/script&gt;
should be applied or the error to send to window.onerror at &lt;/script&gt;
time.

&gt;<i> Also, I would fully expect it to be a web compat requirement that

sure, but that's one error to store with a pending &lt;script&gt; it's
cheaper than most other things. any attempt to speculatively compile
or compile on a thread will have to support queuing the window
assignments / onerror dispatch.

&gt;<i> Which means the that parse/compile/whatever process is currently not
</I>&gt;<i> observable directly. &#160;And that's a good thing!
</I>
agreed

&gt;&gt;<i> in theory, i believe a js engine could choose to discard all work it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has done to validate syntax for x+y beyond saving those coordinates,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then either do the proper ast / bytecode / machine code generation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lazily (or schedule to do it on a thread).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure; a js engine could also not do any syntax validation at all, until it
</I>&gt;<i> needs to run the script...
</I>
my operative assumption is that the scripts we're dealing with have
lots of functions which are declared but which will not be used in a
given page instance, which means that there /could/ be a win in not
performing a complete compile, both in time and space. obviously any
changes to the engines increases complexity which is a loss of sorts.
