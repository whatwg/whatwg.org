And constructing whatever output model (AST, bytecode, whatever) your 
parser produces.

Browsers don't do much stuff eagerly in this space.

Based on my profiles of script loading and execution in Spidermonkey, 
parsing _is_ in fact pretty expensive (very commonly much more expensive 
than the initial execution for large scripts, since most of the script 
is cold).

That said, Spidermonkey's parser does in fact do some optimization 
(constant-folding and the like).  But it also ends up having to create 
large data structures, read a bunch of data, sometimes ends up running 
O(N^2) algorithms, etc, etc.

If you have actual data, not just conjecture, as to the amount of time 
the parser takes in other ECMAScript implementations, which I have not 
profiled, I would love to see that data.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't really see the problem with rewriting your code so you

</I>
Because that makes your code much slower in some cases?
