</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or at least we won't ever be able to do that for cross-site resources.

</I>
It seems desirable that the third party site could opt in to allowing
this. Especially if it can choose which sites should be able to cache
it. Which I think is the feature request that Michael starts with in
this thread.
