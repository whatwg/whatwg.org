<PRE>?&gt; The major issue I have with the way the spec is written is that there is 
no way to feature detect this capability. I'd like this behavior (which I 
agree, is useful), to be more explicit so we can easily make use where 
available.

I agree, the spec doesn't make it clear in its current wording how this 
could be feature-tested. And (as you know, Nicholas), I'm a firm believer 
that any new functionality *must* be feature-testable rather than 
browser-inferences or UA sniffing. :)

However, the current IE implementation (with the additional `readyState` 
property) does actually provide a feasible feature-test (in fact, I'm 
working on a new revision of LABjs to take advantage of this functionality 
for IE).

The feature-test for IE essentially looks for the presence of the 
`readyState` property on a newly created script element, and then also 
inspects its value, because in IE it always defaults to &quot;uninitialized&quot; as 
its value. The reason for having to also test the value is because Opera has 
had a present-but-non-functional `readyState` property on their script 
elements since like 9.2, with a default value of &quot;loaded&quot;.

If the spec considers adding an event system to this mechanism similar to or 
compatible with IE's existing mechanism, I think this could be a valid 
approach to feature-testing, assuming the browsers all agree to play nicely.
