That's a bug in the browser. If it knows it's going to be zooming up the 
canvas when it creates the backing store, it should be using a bigger 
backing store.

It may be necessary to know the CSS pixel scaling to match the backend 
bitmap with the device today, but this is only because of bugs in the 
browsers. The solution isn't to add a feature to the spec, and then wait 
for the browsers to implement it, that lets you work around the bug in 
browsers. The solution is for the browsers to fix the bug instead.

</I>
By &quot;graphics layer&quot; I meant CSS, media queries, and image decoders.

&lt;canvas&gt; is intended to be device-agnostic.

</I>&gt;<i> That's it. If you go to Google books, and your zoom level is turned up, 
</I>&gt;<i> the image displayed will be upscaled, with some possible blurriness. 
</I>&gt;<i> This could be avoided, by simply exposing the CSS pixel ratios, so that

</I>
I went to books.google.com, opened up the first book in my library, and 
zoomed in, and it reflowed and rerendered the text to be quite crisp. I 
don't see any problem here. Images were similiarly handled beautifully.

Could you elaborate on the steps to reproduce this problem?
