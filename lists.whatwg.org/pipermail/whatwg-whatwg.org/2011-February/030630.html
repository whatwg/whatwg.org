I think that proposal 3 would be easier (or at least safer) for Mozilla 
to implement.

Clearly IE's current behavior would be easier for IE to implement.  ;)

I'd like to know what Opera and Webkit folks think, in terms of 
implementation difficulty.

I don't think I do.  Proposal 3 sounded fine to me last I saw it.
