How does it differ? As far as I can tell, it works the same as the spec 
says (the document.location is &quot;about:blank&quot; in the example above).


&gt;<i> For the others, I believe we execute them in the script environment of the
</I>&gt;<i> owner document of the object/embed/applet, whereas the spec requires them to
</I>&gt;<i> execute in a sandbox, as far as I can tell.
</I>
Ah, interesting. For &lt;object&gt;, this seems to be a unique feature of 
Firefox. Opera also executes the script in the context of the owner, but 
then ignores the results as far as I can tell. Other browsers don't seem 
to support javascript: in data=&quot;&quot; at all.

For &lt;embed&gt;, only Firefox does this (tested using window.alert). I didn't 
test further with &lt;embed&gt; since there doesn't seem to be a use case for 
this anyway.

I didn't test &lt;applet&gt;.


&gt;<i> Note that there is some confusion here in terms of browsing contexts and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt;, since &lt;object&gt; does expose a Document object sometimes (but not
</I>&gt;<i> others) and does participate in session history sometimes, I believe...  So
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure what behavior the spec calls for for &lt;object&gt;.
</I>
It's defined; see the section on the &lt;onject&gt; element.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For what it's worth, as I see it there are three possible behaviors for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a javascript: URI (whether in an attribute value or elsewhere):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1)  Don't run the script.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2)  Run the script, but in a sandbox.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3)  Run the script against some Window object (which one?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Defining which of these happens in which case would be good.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Again, Gecko's behavior is #2 by default (in all sorts of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; situations; basically anywhere you can dereference a URI), with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; exceptions made to do #3 in some cases.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's what the spec says currently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't agree with your comments about &lt;script src&gt; above...
</I>
Indeed, I misspoke. The spec actually defaults to not running the script, 
but in most circumstances of interest does #2, and in a number of other 
cases does #3 or does #1 explicitly even if it would otherwise do #2 or 
#3. It's complicated. :-)

There's a minor body of work on the Web that is based on using javascript: 
URLs to generate bitmaps, and I don't really see any harm with this.


&gt;<i> I'll keep you posted if there are any compatibility issues that come up

</I>
What the spec currently specs seems to be a reasonable compromise between 
security, compatibility needs based on what browsers do today, use cases, 
and consistency across the platform (usability), in that order.

Obviously if browsers implement something different, then I'll happily 
move the spec to match, but it would be sad to just close off these 
features without good reason.

Hm. This currently isn't specced; the spec just assumes the return value 
is text/html string data and doesn't say what encoding to use. Is there a 
good way to test this in the context of an &lt;iframe&gt;, where all the 
browsers do something with javascript:?
