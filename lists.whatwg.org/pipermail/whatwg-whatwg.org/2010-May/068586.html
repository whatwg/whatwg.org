</I>Agreed, not good. The intent of the api is to start opening a socket now,
not at some undefined point in the future after the user has taken some
undefined action (hey user... please close a tab that has a socket open...
not particularly user actionable).


&gt;<i> If there are any WebSockets in CLOSING state, then I think we should wait
</I>&gt;<i> until they have closed. Otherwise, I think we should force close the oldest
</I>&gt;<i> WebSocket.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Force closing the oldest is not good. A malicious site could cause all open
sockets to be closed. Also this would have nasty side effects. Consider a
memory allocator that just deleted the oldest allocation to make room for
new allocations, far removed things just start failing on odd ways... no
thank you.

An obvious way to handle this condition of &quot;too many sockets are open&quot; is to
fail to open the new socket with an exception/error which indicates that
condition.
