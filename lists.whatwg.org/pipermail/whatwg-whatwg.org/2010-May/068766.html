</I>
I don't have something decent to offer for the first and last bullets  
but I'd like to throw-in something for the middle bullet:

The http protocol is vastly under utilized today when it comes to URIs  
and the various Accept* headers.

Today developers might embed an image in a document as chris.png. Web  
daemons know to find that resource and serve it, in this sense,  
chris.png is a resource locator.

Technically one might reference the image as a resource identifier  
named &quot;chris&quot;. The user's browser may send  &quot;image/gif&quot; as the only  
value of an accept header, signaling the following to the server: &quot;I'm  
supposed to download an image of chris here, but I only support gif,  
so don't bother sending me a .png&quot;. In a perhaps more useful scenario  
the user agent may tell the server &quot;don't bother sending me an image,  
I'm a screen reader, do you have anything my user could listen to?&quot;.  
In this sense, the document's author didn't have to code against or  
account for every possible &quot;context&quot; out there, the author merely puts  
a reference to a higher-level representation that should remain  
forward-compatible with evolving servers and user-agents.

By passing a list of accepted mimetypes, the accept http header  
provides this ability to serve context-aware resources, which starts  
to feel like a contender for catering to your middle bullet.

To that end, new mime-types could be defined to encapsulate media type/ 
bit rate combinations.

Or the accept header might remain confined to media types and  
acceptable bit rate information might get encapsulated into a new  
header, such as: X-Accept-Bitrate .

If you combined the above approach with existing standards for http  
byte range requests, there may be a mechanism there to cater to your  
3rd bullet as well: when network conditions deteriorate, the client  
could interrupt the current stream and issue a new request &quot;where it  
left off&quot; to the server. Although this likel wouldn't work because a  
byte range request would mean nothing on files of two different sizes.  
For playbacked media, time codes would be needed to define range.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to raise an issue that has come up multiple times before,
</I>&gt;<i> but hasn't ever really been addressed properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've in the past talked about how there is a need to adapt the
</I>&gt;<i> bitrate version of a audio or video resource that is being delivered
</I>&gt;<i> to a user agent based on the available bandwidth on the network, the
</I>&gt;<i> available CPU cycles, and possibly other conditions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has been discussed to do this using @media queries and providing
</I>&gt;<i> links to alternative versions of a media resources through the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;source&gt; element inside it. But this is a very inflexible solution,
</I>&gt;<i> since the side conditions for choosing a bitrate version may change
</I>&gt;<i> over time and what is good at the beginning of video playback may not
</I>&gt;<i> be good 2 minutes later (in particular if you're on a mobile device
</I>&gt;<i> driving through town).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, we have discussed the need for supporting a live streaming
</I>&gt;<i> approach such as RTP/RTSP - but RTP/RTSP has its own &quot;non-Web&quot; issues
</I>&gt;<i> that will make it difficult to make it part of a Web application
</I>&gt;<i> framework - in particular it request a custom server and won't just
</I>&gt;<i> work with a HTTP server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In recent times, vendors have indeed started moving away from custom
</I>&gt;<i> protocols and custom servers and have moved towards more intelligence
</I>&gt;<i> in the UA and special approaches to streaming over HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft developed &quot;Smooth Streaming&quot; [1], Apple developed &quot;HTTP Live
</I>&gt;<i> Streaming&quot; [2] and Adobe recently launched &quot;HTTP Dynamic Streaming&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> [3]. (Also see a comparison at [4]). As these vendors are working on
</I>&gt;<i> it for MPEG files, so are some people for Ogg. I'm not aware anyone is
</I>&gt;<i> looking at it for WebM yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Standards bodies haven't held back either. The 3GPP organisation have
</I>&gt;<i> defined 3GPP adaptive HTTP Streaming (AHS) in their March 2010 release
</I>&gt;<i> 9 of  3GPP [5]. Now, MPEG has started consolidating approaches for
</I>&gt;<i> adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP for MPEG file formats [6].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adaptive bitrate streaming over HTTP is the correct approach towards
</I>&gt;<i> solving the double issues of adapting to dynamic bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> availability, and of providing a live streaming approach that is
</I>&gt;<i> reliable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, no standard exists that has been proven to work in a
</I>&gt;<i> format-independent way. This is particularly an issue for HTML5, where
</I>&gt;<i> we want at least support for MPEG4, Ogg Theora/Vorbis, and WebM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that it is not difficult to solve this issue in a
</I>&gt;<i> format-independent way, which is why solutions are jumping up
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere. They are, however, not compatible and create a messy
</I>&gt;<i> environment where people have to install solutions for multiple
</I>&gt;<i> different approaches to make sure they are covered for different
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, different devices, and different formats. It's a clear
</I>&gt;<i> situation where a new standard is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The standard basically needs to provide three different things:
</I>&gt;<i> * authoring of content in a specific way
</I>&gt;<i> * description of the alternative files on the server and their
</I>&gt;<i> features for the UA to download and use for switching
</I>&gt;<i> * a means to easily switch mid-way between these alternative files
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am personally not sure which is the right forum to create the new
</I>&gt;<i> standard in, but I know that we have a need for it in HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible / the right way to start something like this as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the Web applications work at WHATWG?
</I>&gt;<i> (Incidentally, I've brought this up in W3C before an not got any
</I>&gt;<i> replies, so I'm not sure W3C would be a better place for this work.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe IETF? But then, why not here...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do people think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Silvia.
