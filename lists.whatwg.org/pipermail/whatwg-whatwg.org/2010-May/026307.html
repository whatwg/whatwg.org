<PRE>establishing a WebSocket connection:

[[
Note: There is no limit to the number of established WebSocket connections  
a user agent can have with a single remote host. Servers can refuse to  
connect users with an excessive number of connections, or disconnect  
resource-hogging users when suffering high load.
]]

Still, it seems likely that user agents will want to have limits on the  
number of established WebSocket connections, whether to a single remote  
host or multiple remote hosts, in a single tab or overall. The question is  
what should be done when the user agent-defined limit of established  
connections has been reached and a page tries to open another WebSocket.

I think just waiting for other WebSockets to close is not good. It just  
means that newly loaded pages don't work.

If there are any WebSockets in CLOSING state, then I think we should wait  
until they have closed. Otherwise, I think we should force close the  
oldest WebSocket.
