Hosts have limits on open file descriptors but they are usually in the ten's of thousands (per process) on today's OSs.

I don't think this is an area for the spec.  The open must be allowed to fail if something goes wrong.  The OS might reject it and the browser might reject it too.  Aside from that, I don't think the spec should dictate what to do here.

A nice UA, I think, would monitor a particular tab or browsing context for being out of control.  This might be opening an infinite number of sockets or running infinite threads to bog the user's system down (or it might be because I forgot a semicolon :-).  There are countless ways for nasty javascript to upset the user.  A nice UA from a nice group would learn these new ways and adapt to them over time.  When detected, the UA could ask the user if they want this mayhem to continue or not.  I think rampant socket abuse is just one of countless places nasty javascript is going to exploit the user.  I don't see how the spec can foresee all of them nor should a &quot;complaint UA&quot; be required to detect all of them.
