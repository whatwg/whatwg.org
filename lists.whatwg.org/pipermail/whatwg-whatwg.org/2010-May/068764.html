&gt;<i> 2010/5/23 Silvia Pfeiffer &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">silviapfeiffer1 at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just came across this thread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1397067">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1397067</A> and found it a most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting read!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Particularly the comment of jiifurusu .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems the subtitling community is developing a replacement format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for ASS with advanced features beyond what WebSRT has. Wouldn't that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> show there is a need for an exchange format with advanced features?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessarily. &#160;It means that people want certain advanced features.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;It doesn't mean that those are necessary, or that the people
</I>&gt;<i> developing those advanced features are aware of existing work they can
</I>&gt;<i> build on, like the entire web stack. &#160;We can do a lot with a very
</I>&gt;<i> simple format that covers all the *necessary* use-cases and can be
</I>&gt;<i> easily implemented by simple devices, and then expose extra
</I>&gt;<i> functionality via the web stack's technologies like CSS for the more
</I>&gt;<i> important devices (that is, anything that can implement the web).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This does presuppose a particular segmentation of device
</I>&gt;<i> needs/priorities, but it's a segmentation that I believe makes the
</I>&gt;<i> most sense for a modern format, given the reality and increasing
</I>&gt;<i> pervasiveness of web-based video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That new format seems to try and cater for high-end needs and lower
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end needs. If we have to develop a new non-HTML-like format, wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it make sense to coordinate with those guys? In particular if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community that we are trying to build upon by reusing SRT is actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against extending SRT?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on that thread, the main argument that community has against
</I>&gt;<i> extending SRT is that it won't be compatible with current authoring
</I>&gt;<i> tools. &#160;Their advice appears to be to instead adopt a new format being
</I>&gt;<i> created which will also be incompatible with current authoring tools,
</I>&gt;<i> though, so I don't know if I can trust their instincts too much. &#160;^_^
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Not saying anything in particular against ASS or AS6, as I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> looked at them in any sort of detail, but they do similarly appear to
</I>&gt;<i> be more complex than we want for the same reasons that everything else
</I>&gt;<i> has been too complex - they build in things that are potentially
</I>&gt;<i> desirable but not necessary, and which can be done through existing
</I>&gt;<i> web-stack technology equally well.)
</I>
The complexity argument will similarly be used by the subtitling
community that if we require all of HTML as a format for high-end
subtitling, we are bringing too much complexity into the subtitling
world.

I think we have to be careful not to make a short-sighted decision
right now with what we think is the 80% use case, which in the future
may turn into more of a 40% use case and the high end features -
things such as animations in subtitles, SVG images in subtitles,
hyperlinks in subtitles, transparent overlay images in subtitles, etc
- will be much more common, because the world's technology has moved
on and subtitles are much more common. I look in particular at what is
already possible on YouTube with subtitle-like technology such as
annotations and even the overlay ads. I know that much of this is not
for accessibility, but why would we not think beyond accessibility for
something as important as timed text for video.

Cheers,
Silvia.
