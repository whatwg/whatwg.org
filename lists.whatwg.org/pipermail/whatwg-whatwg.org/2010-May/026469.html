</I>&gt;<i> -- media resources are allowed to have a non-zero &quot;initial playback time&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> DOM attribute. Players would be encouraged to use this to display real
</I>&gt;<i> times, when it's present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be similar in power to what the spec already has. In your example
</I>&gt;<i> you could either let currentTime=0 be the start of the stream that the

</I>&gt;<i> displayed, or you could let 0 be the real &quot;start&quot;, and set the initial
</I>&gt;<i> playback time to match where the user joined. However, I think describing
</I>&gt;<i> things the way I just did is simpler and avoids weirdness like the &quot;start
</I>&gt;<i> time&quot; changing dynamically. It also preserves the invariant that currentTime
</I>&gt;<i> ranges from 0 to 'duration', which I think players will come to depend on if
</I>&gt;<i> the cases where it's not true are rare.
</I>
Sounds like all the information would be there with this proposal.

Just to clarify: what time would a video display as it is playing back
in the browser?
The currentTime+realTimeOffset (if any), where currentTime would
include any initialPlaybackOffset?
If that can be realised, I believe that would provide the correct
perception to the user.

Cheers,
Silvia.
