When a specification is fully complete, mature, and stable, we tend to release it. A rather shocking consequence of this policy is that drafts tend to be incomplete. What's even more outrageous is that sections explicitly marked as &quot;under development&quot; would be lacking in the contemplation of certain aspects department. The next thing you know it might turn out that C&#233;line Dion karaoke sounds bad.

Two things you might not know though: 1) the current draft does not look at streamed transmission, merely integration with file upload form controls and &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt; through reuse of the File API (this can be discussed of course, but see below) and 2) we're waiting on input we expect from our friends at Mozilla who have some ideas (but alas little time to write).

One interesting suggestion they made was that capture should *not* include a direct way of streaming to a server. Rather, it should solely define how to wire a device to &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;video&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, etc. and there ought to be a separate document describe how to capture the output of an element and AV-stream it to a remote endpoint (or save it to disk). The reason for this is that there's no good reason why you wouldn't want to stream (or save) as AV things that originally aren't. There are plenty of use cases from capturing tutorials to the craziest collaborative film-making happening you can think of and including making a video effects editor inside the browser. Naturally, that's where protocol and format noodling would go. Personally, I think that that distinction makes sense.

Note that going forward you'll probably want to look at <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/camera/">http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/camera/</A> rather than the TR snapshots.
