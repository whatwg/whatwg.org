<PRE>In <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-March/025549.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-March/025549.html</A>
with a subject of &quot;Element-related feedback&quot;, Ian Hixie quoted me and
asked:

&gt;<i>On Fri, 1 Jan 2010, Jim Jewett wrote:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Evil Lawyer&quot; and &quot;Defendant&quot; aren't pronounced.  Their meanings (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> silence) are deduced from English conventions about punctuation.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would prefer a semantic tag.
</I>
Hixie:
&gt;<i> Why? What problem would a semantic tag solve? The default styling here
</I>&gt;<i> seems to not need any particular element; the above is perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> understandable as is as far as I can tell.
</I>
For written output, yes, the convention works.

Ideally, a screen reader should *not* read the attribution labels --
but it should use them to switch voices.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm expecting [scripts] to do something like increase the font size or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change the background for lines *I* have to memorize for *my* character
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [based on the semantic marked in the page identifying the character], or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for cue lines that I have to recognize.
</I>
&gt;<i> Are there any examples of this in the wild? Since this is technically
</I>&gt;<i> possible today, if it's a use case important enough that we should address
</I>&gt;<i> it, it should be easy enough to find examples of this.
</I>
&gt;<i> I'm very reluctant to provide features for hypothetical problems that
</I>&gt;<i> don't stem from a real market need. (If we start solving such problems, we
</I>&gt;<i> would fast find ourselves on the path to feature bloat.)
</I>
I haven't acted much since finding the internet.  I have seen plenty
of printed scripts in which this was done manually with a highlighter
for rehearsals.  I would expect today's equivalent to be done at time
of printing, rather than by a helpful web site.

So the need is there; the question is whether the need is too
specialized (like the various poetry elements) ... if the only use
were scripts, I would say that it was too specialized, but I would
also use it for photo credits (the italicized captions), etc.  Whether
that then makes it too much of a catchall element -- maybe.



&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; You're still not saying why you want this element. What would &lt;attrib&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; be good for? What UI would it trigger? How would users or authors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; benefit?
</I>
(Per above, the UI would change voices in a screen  reader, and could
be used as a hook for user style sheets in scripts.)

&gt;&gt;<i> I would expect it to be used in License checkers that some organizations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would deploy to ensure they aren't violating copyright.
</I>
&gt;<i> Wouldn't the Work microdata vocabulary be a better solution to this
</I>&gt;<i> problem?
</I>
Possibly.  I find that more complicated, but the precision may be
worth the complication.

&gt;&gt;<i> I would expect it to be used by some scrapers looking for stock photos.
</I>
&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean. Wouldn't fingerprinting the photos be more
</I>&gt;<i> effective?
</I>
I was thinking of scrapers acting on behalf of a consumer --
collecting a bunch of photos that you would be allowed to use.

&gt;&gt;<i> I would expect it to be used with custom CSS for some users, who are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really looking for a model or photographer rather than an existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> photograph.
</I>
&gt;<i> I don't understand this case. Can you elaborate? Maybe an example of this
</I>&gt;<i> use in the wild would help.
</I>
Some of the original &lt;cite&gt; examples from the wild were really credits
-- they listed the photographer and the model.  Plenty of model and
photographer websites are largely devoted to finding each other; I
assume that this is because photographers are looking to find (and
then contact) models with a particular look, while models are looking
to be photographed by photographers skilled in a certain style.
Again, this seems like a fairly specialized need, but I've seen in on
several sites, and it again gets met by an attribution or credits
element.

[On why &lt;cite&gt; should really be read as &lt;title_of_work&gt;, but still
called &lt;cite&gt; for historical reasons]

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why would it be wrong to have an element to style titles [for titles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of works]?
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Turning around your favorite question, what is the semantic value?
</I>
&gt;<i> It provides a way to have appropriate default styling (italics, in the
</I>&gt;<i> visual medium) for a typographic feature that is widely used, while
</I>&gt;<i> allowing it to be easily restyled independent of other uses of italics.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the same benefit &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, etc, have.
</I>
I think &quot;title of work&quot; is itself a fairly rare case.  Normally, it is
enough to just put it in quotes or italics.  The times when you care
that it is a title aren't really more common than the times that you
care about attribution.
