</I>Yeah, you're right. This would be problematic. This does convince me, 
that using &lt;h&gt; is not a good idea.

</I>I wanted to say, that it does not make sense to me, to use a highest 
ranking heading in all sections, subsections, and subsubsubsections, 
especially if they cannot be used solely (out of context).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But maybe you are right. The html5 spec is already blown up with stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nobody will ever use (keygen?) enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Amusingly enough, keygen is something I use once a year or so (when my 
</I>&gt;<i> user certificate expires), and something that MIT students need to use 
</I>&gt;<i> to, say, register for classes (or view their grades, deal with 
</I>&gt;<i> bursar's office stuff online, etc, etc).  See 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://ca.mit.edu/ca/certgen">https://ca.mit.edu/ca/certgen</A> (though that will likely require a 
</I>&gt;<i> login... that you may not have).  See 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ist.mit.edu/services/certificates">http://ist.mit.edu/services/certificates</A> for the various documentation.
</I>I do not deny, that keygen has it's use cases (the &quot;nobody&quot; was 
hyperbolic). I only think, that the use cases are *very* rare. It is 
overkill to introduce an HTML element therefore. It would be much more 
sane to provide a JS API (as Janos proposed.) [I would do it myself, but 
I have only very little knowledge on encryption.]
