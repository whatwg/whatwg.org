I am utterly confused now. I think we need a picture. So, let me give
this a shot.

This is the streaming video resource:

(1)--------------------(2)#########(3)====(4)-------------------------------(5)

(1) is when the video started getting transmitted
(2) is where the UA joined in and started playing back from
(3) is up to where the UA has played back
(4) is up to where the UA has data buffered
(5) is when the video will end (which is most probably not known)
Let's further say the video started streaming on 1st January 2010 at 10am.

The video's timeline is:
(1) =&gt; 0 sec
(2) =&gt; t1 sec with t1 &gt;= 0
(3) =&gt; t2 sec with t2 &gt;= t1
(4) =&gt; t3 sec with t3 &gt;= t2
(5) =&gt; t4 sec with t4 &gt;= t3

I am assuming what is displayed in the video player is exactly this
video's timeline, i.e. t1 at (2), t2 at (3), and t4 at (5). Now, the
position (1) is not visible in the video player? Or is it visible and
playback starts in the 'controls' with an offset? In that latter case,
we can jump back to the beginning in the interface, in the earlier
case, we can't except for maybe with media fragment URIs. But I quite
like the representation from 0 with an actual playback start of t1.

Here's how I've understood it would work with the attributes:
* currentTime is the video's timeline as described, so since we are at
offset (3), currentTime = t2.
* initialTime = t1, namely the offset at where the video playback started.
* dateTime = 2010-01-01T10:00:00.000


Incidentally, the current concept of startTime has had me utterly
confused. I wonder if it meant that seeking to a time before t1 wasn't
possible. I don't know why such a concept would be necessary unless a
live stream wouldn't be seekable before the current time. But maybe
that is much more easily represented by &quot;seekable&quot;.


Cheers,
Silvia.
