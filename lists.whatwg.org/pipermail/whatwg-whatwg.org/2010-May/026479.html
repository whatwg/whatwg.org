Yes.

I don't think the current spec allows you to seek to before the &quot;earliest
&gt;<i> possible position&quot;, pretty much by definition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are the cases I know of where an offset of some kind may be relevant:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * live streaming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * server-applied media fragments where the offset of the fragment is given

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For live streaming, I'm not sure the current spec has a problem, if
</I>&gt;<i> browsers would implement the startTime property.
</I>

But you just said you want to get rid of startTime &quot;regardless of anything
else&quot;!

For resources which themself claim an offset, I think we should let them
&gt;<i> start at 0 anyway and let people who really want a weird timeline fix it
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>

That means they basically won't work with most players, which won't be
expecting to deal with negative seekable times or the &quot;weird timeline&quot;.
