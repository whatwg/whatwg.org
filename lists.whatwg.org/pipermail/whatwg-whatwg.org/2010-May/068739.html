Here's how I think it should work:
-- currentTime (and related times, such as times in TimeRanges) range from 0
to 'duration'
-- media resources are allowed to have a non-zero &quot;initial playback time&quot;.
This is what currentTime should be set to on media load. We could create a
new DOM attribute to expose this.
-- media resources are allowed to have a &quot;real time offset&quot;. This is an
optional date+time (in UTC) that corresponds to currentTime=0, exposed as a
DOM attribute. Players would be encouraged to use this to display real
times, when it's present.

This would be similar in power to what the spec already has. In your example
you could either let currentTime=0 be the start of the stream that the
user's loading, and use the &quot;real time offset&quot; to get the correct time
displayed, or you could let 0 be the real &quot;start&quot;, and set the initial
playback time to match where the user joined. However, I think describing
things the way I just did is simpler and avoids weirdness like the &quot;start
time&quot; changing dynamically. It also preserves the invariant that currentTime
ranges from 0 to 'duration', which I think players will come to depend on if
the cases where it's not true are rare.
