I disagree with that last statement - audio does need subtitle-like
constructs, too. For example, if you want lyrics to be displayed in
sync with the audio, then it can be done with the same construct as
captions or subtitles work for video.


But I do agree with the need to keep audio and video as different
resource types with their own APIs. This far, in the life of HTML,
text has been the main driver of the Web, interspersed with images and
formatting instructions for text. By treating video and audio as their
own elements in their own right, we can finally move on into a world
of multimedia where audio and video can have their own formatting
instructions and their own JavaScript API - none of this would e
possible by leaving them hidden in an &lt;a&gt; element, or even in an
&lt;embed&gt; element, where it is totally unclear what the content will be.

Bjartur, I do wonder what exactly your motivation is in suggesting
audio and video be degraded back to undetermined embedded outside
content. What would be won by going back to that way? Lots will be
lost though - if you have ever developed a Website with Flash video,
you will know how much work is involved in creating a specific
JavaScript API to the Flash video player so that you can have some
interaction between the rest of the Webpage and the video or audio
resource. We honestly don't ever want to go back to that way.

Cheers,
Silvia.
