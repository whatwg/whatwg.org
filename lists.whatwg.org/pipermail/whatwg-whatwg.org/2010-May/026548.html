I have no issues with @volume and @muted being IDL attributes - it is
important to be able to change them from script. What I am wondering
is why they cannot also be content attributes. I don't think that
would put an extra implementation burden on Web browsers and it would
really help with markup simplicity.

Also, the suggestion to edit the media resource just to change the
loudness seems inappropriate. What if I am referencing a resource that
is not on a server that I control?

I really don't think introducing these as content attributes creates
additional complexity in browsers - seeing as most already offer the
muting functionality in context menus and the default controls already
implement volume control. Since it comes for cheap and it offers quite
a substantial simplification for Web authors, my suggestion is to give
them content attribute status.

Regards,
Silvia.
