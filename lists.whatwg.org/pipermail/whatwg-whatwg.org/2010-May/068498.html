<PRE>I was expecting criticism; as is unavoidable with all crypto issues.

You asked many questions, and unfortunately all you missed the  
auth=&quot;verisign&quot; argument, which _is_ enough to prevent all practical  
(,even if they are all theoretical!,) man-in-the-middle attacks.

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;meta encrypt pubkey=&quot;ABABAEFEF2626EFEFEF&quot; pubtool=&quot;EC256-AES&quot;  
passsalt=&quot;colordev.com&quot; auth=&quot;verisign&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&lt;?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?&gt;&quot;&gt;
   Username: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;user&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   Password: &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

the above 'page' using the meta-encrypt tag, which is enough for a  
client browser to submit to site
a) a salted password
b) and a user name transported in encrypted form; over the internet

Maybe someone can show a _complete_ alternative Javascript &amp; https  
solution about how those can be achieved in a computer or PDA-device  
without javascript support.

I am not suggesting replacing https with anything, government and  
business sites can and should keep on using it.  I am suggesting a  
small easy to use mini-encryption which would be enough for those 90%  
of sites should salt their passwords and encrypt sensitive data and  
but who currently aren't.

question 1:
&gt;<i> The server has to read and correctly parse each HTML page to decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether to encrypt it? (And how does the browser know that the page is
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted, vs. a legacy server that doesn't encrypt?)
</I>
answer 1:
Most servers are already configured to read the requested pages before  
submitting those over the internet. For example my above form-page has  
a small php-script inside which the server program must notice; as the  
PHP-program needs to compile the script. Client never sees the &lt;?php  
echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?&gt; part but is instead shown an URL. To  
implement meta-encrypt tag would just require (on/off) configuring  
server program to read the header of requested page and see if there  
is a meta-encrypt tag in there the server calls a program which  
decrypts! the client submitted data.

Obviously you people will keep complaining, so what do you want to  
complain next
1) Man-in-the-middle problem; which doesn't exists because
	a) those are just academic mind games
	b) if auth=&quot;verisign&quot; is used as external CA
2) HTTPS = good (even if it is typically NOT used with forms
3) password salting = webmasters duty to do it (which 50% forget),  
after using the HTTPS (which 90% forget)
4) Declaring encrypt action doesn't fit into HTML (; then why is there  
a form method get/post)
