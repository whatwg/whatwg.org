&gt;&gt;<i>I just came across a curious situation in the spec: IIUC, it seems the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Webpage has to use JavaScript to turn down (or up) the loudness of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>their media elements or mute them rather than just being able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>specify this through content attributes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If you want to control the volume for the user after the page loads

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I've searched the archives and didn't find a discussion or reasons for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I am guessing the reasons for not having them as content attributes is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that anything that requires muting of audio-visual content is assumed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to need JavaScript anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>However, if I have multiple videos on a page, all on autoplay, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would be nice to turn off the sound of all of them without JavaScript.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>With all the new CSS3 functionality, I can, for example, build a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>spinning cube of video elements that are on autoplay or a marquee of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>videos on autoplay - all of which would require muting the videos to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>be bearable. If we added @muted to the content attributes, it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>easy to set the muted state without having to write any JavaScript.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you need the audio to be muted you should use CSS. If you need to
</I>&gt;<i> control volume dynamically you need scripting.
</I>
I am not aware of a CSS property for media elements that lets you
control the muted state. Can you link me to a specification?


&gt;&gt;<i>As for the @volume attribute, I think it would be similarly useful if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an author could control the loudness at which a video or audio file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>starts playing back, in particular if he/she knows it is actually a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>fairly loud/quiet file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you have a point. That can be done by increasing the volume
</I>&gt;<i> of the soundtrack itself, metedata (like embedded volume metadata in
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG files) and should be possible in CSS. Adding it to HTML as well
</I>&gt;<i> seems redundant.
</I>
Are you saying that a Web author needs to edit the media resource in
order to change the default volume setting for the resource? I think
that's a bit of a stretch. Also, if you have a pointer to how this can
be done in CSS, that would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,
Silvia.
