This is important work, thanks for taking it on and bringing it to a 
wider discussion forum.  Here's a couple of other venues you might also 
consider discussing it, above and beyond discussion on the WHATWG list:

* W3C just launched a new Audio Incubator Group (Audio XG), as a forum 
to discuss various aspects of audio on the Web.  The Audio XG is not 
intended to produce Recommendation-track specifications like this 
(though they will likely prototype and write a draft spec for a 
read-write audio API), but it could serve a role in helping work out use 
cases and requirements, reviewing specs, and so forth.  I'm not totally 
sure that this is relevant to your interests, but I thought I would 
bring it up.

* The Voice Browser Working Group is very interested in bringing their 
work and experience into the graphical browser world, so you should work 
with them or get their input.  As I understand it, some of them plan to 
join the Audio XG, too (specifically to talk about speech synthesis in 
the larger context), so that might be one forum to have some 
conversations.  VoiceXML is rather different than X/HTML or the browser 
DOM, and the participants in the VBWG don't necessarily have the right 
experience in graphical browser approaches, so I think there's an 
opportunity for good conversation and cross-pollination here.
