I didn't mean to say that GPU's are in general evil, just readback. GPU's can do magical things as long as you keep the data there. If your API were to return some abstract wrapper around the resultant image (Like ImageData), it would allow the bits to stay on the GPU. Then you can use the abstract API to pass the image around, render with it, whatever. There might still be some platforms that have to read the pixels back to use them, but not always. For instance, WebGL has API to take an ImageData and load it as a texture. If we see the image from that object are already in the GPU, we can use it directly or copy it (GPU-GPU copies are very fast) to the texture memory.

I'm not sure such a representation is appropriate for all the use cases here, but it would make image handler much faster in many cases.
