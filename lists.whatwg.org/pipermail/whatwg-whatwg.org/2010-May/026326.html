<PRE>As an example from a bit different area, in Chrome the Web Workers today
require a separate process per worker. It's not good to create too many
processes so there is a relatively low limit per origin and higher total
limit. Two limits help avoid situation when 1 bad page affects others. Once
limit is reached, the worker objects are created but queued, on a theory
that pages of the same origin could cooperate, while if a total limit is
blown then hopefully it's a temporary condition. Not ideal but if there
should be a limit we thought having 2 limits (origin/total) is better then
have only a total one.
