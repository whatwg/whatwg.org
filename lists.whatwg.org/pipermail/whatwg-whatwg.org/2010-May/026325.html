Ah.  Thats a good question.  (Maybe that was the original question.)

Since web sockets is the topic and as far as I know web sockets are only used by javascript, I would prefer an error over queuing them up.

I think javascript and browser facilities have what is needed to create its own retry mechanism if that is what a particular situation wants.  I don't see driving the retry via a scripting language to be bad.  Its not that hard and it won't happen that often.  And it gives the javascript authors more control and choices.

Thats my vote...
