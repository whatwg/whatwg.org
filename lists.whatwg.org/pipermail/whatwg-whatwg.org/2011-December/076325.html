<PRE>By not moving IME's off OSes, you're asking every OS connecting to the
internet to support this feature. Netbooks for example, may just have a
native web browser on it. Would its OS then need to implement its own IME
for a few languages for their entry? Instead its web browser could just
support the input field, given they can render them.

</I>&gt;<i> one in Foxit Reader plus a host of others. I also have separate copies
