Whether the frames are split into multiple frames or not is a browser 
decision; at the API level you just say what to send and let the browser 
take care of it. It doesn't have to be kept in memory; in fact, if you're 
sending a Blob, for example, it's quite possible that the whole thing will 
never be stored in RAM. In certain architectures it might never be stored 
in RAM, but be sent straight from the disk controller to the network 
controller bypassing RAM and the CPU entirely.

</I>
Supporting sending and receiving streams is something that we'll probably 
add in due course. First we have to actually have streams at all in the 
Web platform.


&gt;<i> 3/ MessageEvent should expose what kind of data was received, textual,

</I>
I don't really follow here. Isn't the type just going to be what you ask 
for?

Indeed.
