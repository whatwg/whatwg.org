That's normal for the web.

Indeed.  I don't think anyone thinks the existing situation is all fine 
or anything.

&gt;<i> I said I agreed with him that Faruk's solution was not good. However, I

</I>&gt;<i> declaration
</I>
This might work, if there hasn't been too much cargo-culting yet.  Data 
urgently needed!

&gt;&gt;<i> Not unless we change the authoring tools.  Half the time these things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are just directly exported from a word processor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please educate me. I'm perhaps 'handicapped' in that regard: I haven't

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;export&quot; means &quot;copy and paste&quot;
</I>
It can mean that, or &quot;save as HTML&quot; followed by copy and paste.

&gt;<i> then on the Mac, everything gets
</I>&gt;<i> converted via the clipboard
</I>
On Mac, the default OS encoding is UTF-8 last I checked.  That's 
decidedly not the case on Windows.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> OK: Quotation marks. However, in 'old web pages', then you also find
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> much more use of HTML entities (such as&#8220;) than you find today.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We should take advantage of that, no?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no idea what you're trying to say,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry. What I meant was that character entities are encoding
</I>&gt;<i> independent.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> And that lots of people - and authoring tools - have
</I>&gt;<i> inserted non-ASCII letters and characters as character entities,
</I>
Sure.  And lots have inserted them &quot;directly&quot;.

&gt;<i> At any rate: A page which uses
</I>&gt;<i> character entities for non-ascii would render the same regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> encoding, hence a switch to UTF-8 would not matter for those.
</I>
Sure.  We're not worried about such pages here.
