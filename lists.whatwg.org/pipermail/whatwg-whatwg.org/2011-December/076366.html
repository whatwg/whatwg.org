As far as I can see, the problem presented was: &#8220;I still frequently 
break websites and webapps simply by entering my name (Faruk Ate&#351;).&#8221; 
What we need to fix such issues is that sites and applications are 
modified to _deal with_ any characters, and this means that they 
minimally need to _parse_ input data as UTF-8 encoded. Of course their 
authors need to specify that the form data is to be submitted as UTF-8 
encoded, normally by making the page UTF-8 encoded and declaring it as 
such. This is surely the most trivial side of the matter.

Pages that currently cannot handle the letter &#8220;&#351;&#8221; in input data would 
not behave any better if browsers started treating them as UTF-8 
encoded, which is what the proposed change would me. On the contrary, 
they would work worse. They probably currently work for some set of 
characters outside ASCII, such as ISO-8859-1, and the change would stop 
that, as letters like &#8220;&#226;&#8221; would now be transmitted as UTF-8 encoded but 
the form handler implies another encoding and sees the data as something 
completely different.

&gt;<i> But with the proposed change, then even users *outside* the locales that
</I>&gt;<i> share the default encoding of the sloppy author's locale, would benefit.
</I>
Exactly how would _any_ user benefit from the proposed change? I have 
shown that for the form data issue presented, the change would create 
serious problems, not solve any&#8212;except in the rather theoretical case 
where form data processing is based on UTF-8, the page is actually UTF-8 
encoded but its encoding is not declared in any way (any examples of 
such pages around?) and the user&#8217;s browser implies an encoding other 
than UTF-8. In this theoretical case, the error correction principle 
I&#8217;ve suggested (don&#8217;t just apply an encoding if it turns out that the 
page cannot be in that encoding) would probably fix the problem if the 
page contains non-ASCII characters.
