<PRE>Why do you feel it is necessary to sway IME's off OSes? As far as I know
the OS ones are all freely downloadable or included in OS distributions.
The downloadable ones are not even as hard to find as they used to be.
They're needed for all text input fields across the system. They're
complicated enough that I wouldn't want to have to learn different ones
in different applications.

I quite agree about the dictionaries and not just for IMEs. I have a
ridiculous number of English dictionaries installed on my system, e.g.,
one in Thunderbird, one in Firefox, one in MS Office, one in XMLMind,
one in Foxit Reader plus a host of others. I also have separate copies
of the _same_ Japanese dictionaries in Thunderbird and Firefox for use
by the Rikaichan plug-in. However having dictionary look-up only
available as a network service is a very dangerous way to go from the
perspective of civil rights and liberties. It needs to be a service
available locally perhaps with an option to go to the network.

Regards

    -Mark
