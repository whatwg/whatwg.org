Thanks for this research, it is quite illuminating.

Given the current situation of low interoperability on these target 
values, and possibly more importantly given that browsers as a whole are 
moving away from secondary browsing contexts at all, I think it's easier 
and simpler on the long run to just drop _main and _content entirely.

One could actually argue that the pages that exist that use _main and 
_content actually work _better_ in current UAs with those values being 
interpreted as browsing context names than they would if they were treated 
as synonyms for _self or _top, because it would let a user open the page 
up in a window and have the links open in a window next to it, reproducing 
the old behaviour with secondary browsing contexts.

Having said that, I think it's fine for a browser that supports secondary 
browsing contexts to implement a spec that itself defines _main or 
_content or both, even if that spec defines its meaning as different than 
the error-recovery behaviour defined in the HTML spec, and even if it 
defines it to apply to main browsing contexts too. Which is to say, if 
browsers ever go back to having secondary browsing contexts, it'd make 
sense for them to implement these values with relevant behaviours.
