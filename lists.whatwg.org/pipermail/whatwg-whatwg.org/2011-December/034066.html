Where by &quot;it&quot; you mean &quot;open a text editor, type some text, and save&quot;. 
So they get whatever encoding their OS and editor defaults to.

And yes, then they find that it works ok, so they don't worry about 
encodings.

&gt;&gt;<i> No.  He's describing a problem using UTF-8 to view pages that are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> written in English.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And why is that a problem in those cases when it is a problem?
</I>
Because the characters are wrong?

&gt;<i> Do he read those languages, anyway?
</I>
Do you read English?  Seriously, what are you asking there, exactly?

(For the record, reading a particular page in a language is a much 
simpler task than reading the language; I can't &quot;read German&quot;, but I can 
certainly read a German subway map.)

&gt;<i> The solution I proposed was that English locale browsers should default
</I>&gt;<i> to UTF-8.
</I>
I know the solution you proposed.  That solution tries to avoid the 
issues David was describing by only breaking things for people in 
English browser locales, I understand that.

&gt;&gt;<i> Why does it matter?  David's default locale is almost certainly en-US,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which defaults to ISO-8859-1 (or whatever Windows-??? encoding that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually means on the web) in his browser.  But again, he's changed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default encoding from the locale default, so the locale is irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The locale is meant to predominantly be used within a physical locale.
</I>
Yes, so?

&gt;<i> If he is at another physical locale or a virtually other locale, he
</I>&gt;<i> should not be expecting that it works out of the box unless a common
</I>&gt;<i> encoding is used.
</I>
He was responding to a suggestion that the default encoding be changed 
to UTF-8 for all locales.  Are you _really_ sure you understood the 
point of his mail?

&gt;<i> Even today, if he visits Japan, he has to either
</I>&gt;<i> change his browser settings *or* to rely on the pages declaring their
</I>&gt;<i> encodings. So nothing would change, for him, when visiting Japan &#8212; with
</I>&gt;<i> his browser or with his computer.
</I>
He wasn't saying it's a problem for him per se.  He's a somewhat 
sophisticated browser user who knows how to change the encoding for a 
particular page.

What he was saying is that there are lots of pages out there that aren't 
encoded in UTF-8 and rely on locale fallbacks to particular encodings, 
and that he's run into them a bunch while traveling in particular, so 
they were not pages in English.  So far, you and he seem to agree.

&gt;<i> Yes, there would be a change, w.r.t. Enlgish quotation marks (see
</I>&gt;<i> below) and w.r.tg. visiting Western European languages pages: For those
</I>&gt;<i> a number of pages which doesn't fail with Win-1252 as the default,
</I>&gt;<i> would start to fail. But relatively speaking, it is less important that
</I>&gt;<i> non-English pages fail for the English locale.
</I>
No one is worried about that, particularly.

&gt;<i> There is a very good chance, also, that only very few of the Web pages
</I>&gt;<i> for such professional institutions would fail to declare their encoding.
</I>
You'd be surprised.

&gt;&gt;<i> Modulo smart quotes (and recently unicode ellipsis characters).  These
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are actually pretty common in English text on the web nowadays, and have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a tendency to be in &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we change the default, they will start to tend to be in UTF-8.
</I>
Not unless we change the authoring tools.  Half the time these things 
are just directly exported from a word processor.

&gt;<i> OK: Quotation marks. However, in 'old web pages', then you also find
</I>&gt;<i> much more use of HTML entities (such as&ldquo;) than you find today.
</I>&gt;<i> We should take advantage of that, no?
</I>
I have no idea what you're trying to say,

&gt;<i> When you mention quotation marks, then you mention a real locale
</I>&gt;<i> related issue. And may be the Euro sign too?
</I>
Not an issue for me personally, but it could be for some, yes.

&gt;<i> Nevertheless, the problem is smallest for languages that primarily limit their alphabet to those
</I>&gt;<i> letter that are present in the American Standard Code for Information
</I>&gt;<i> Interchange format.
</I>
Sure.  It may still be too big.

&gt;<i> It would be logical, thus, to start the switch to
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-8 for those locales
</I>
If we start at all.

&gt;<i> Perhaps we need to have a project to measure these problems, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> all these anecdotes?
</I>
Sure.  More data is always better than ancedotes.
