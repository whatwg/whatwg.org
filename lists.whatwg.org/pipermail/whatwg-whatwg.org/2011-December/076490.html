<PRE>It sounds like you might be interested in Chromeless:

If you'd like to see this kind of future, consider contributing to that effort.

&gt;<i> What is the reason you won't let us make our own browsers-in-a-browser?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not talking about some module you have to build yourself in order to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute a browser as an executable. I'm talking about visiting a
</I>&gt;<i> (secure/signed?) page on the web and being asked permission to give it any
</I>&gt;<i> or all powers including the ability to visit and display other
</I>&gt;<i> non-cross-domain-enabled sites, with the long-term possibility of browsers
</I>&gt;<i> becoming a mostly bare shell for installing full-featured browsers
</I>&gt;<i> (utilizing the possibility for APIs for these &quot;browsers&quot; to themselves
</I>&gt;<i> accept, integrate, and offline-cache add-on code from other websites,
</I>&gt;<i> emulating their own add-on system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there are security risks, but a standardized, cross-platform,
</I>&gt;<i> re-envisioned and expanded equivalent of ActiveX, which can work well with
</I>&gt;<i> Firewalls, does not add to the risks already inherent in the web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not interested in the argument that &quot;It is just too dangerous&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;Browsers already allow people to download executables with a couple clicks,
</I>&gt;<i> not to mention install privileged browser add-ons. Enough said. There is
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no real difference between these and what I am proposing, except
</I>&gt;<i> that executables offer the added inconvenience of being non-cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> and awkward for requiring a separate, non-readily-unifiable means of
</I>&gt;<i> managing installations. Otherwise, please someone tell me what is the
</I>&gt;<i> /insurmountable/ difference?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not really interested in a prolonged technical discussion or debate
</I>&gt;<i> about the limitations of existing technologies. I am asking at a higher
</I>&gt;<i> level why bright people can't help us move to a web like this. As per Ian's
</I>&gt;<i> signature, &quot;Things that are impossible just take longer&quot;, I see no logical
</I>&gt;<i> reason why such a web can't be envisioned and built.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the resistance I have seen to the idea among otherwise bright people, I
</I>&gt;<i> can only reach the conclusion that there must be some ulterior motives
</I>&gt;<i> behind the resistance. The main browsers would not be able to corner the
</I>&gt;<i> market as easily anymore if such a thing happened. Because as long as there
</I>&gt;<i> are these oligopolic fiefdoms requiring a separate set of JavaScript API
</I>&gt;<i> standards for run-of-the-mill web developers to be able to develop
</I>&gt;<i> privileged applications easily---or for them to be unable to interact in a
</I>&gt;<i> privileged fashion with other such applications, there is less competition
</I>&gt;<i> and sadly, the world won't see competitive and collective innovations
</I>&gt;<i> leading to better privileged browsers. &#160;Rather we are stuck with a
</I>&gt;<i> centralized model whereby, the main browsers remain the gate-keepers of
</I>&gt;<i> innovation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The dream of &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; is thankfully becoming more realized
</I>&gt;<i> with HTML5, though there is still a need for an expanded dream, something
</I>&gt;<i> along the lines of &quot;Write once, run anywhere, access any functionality
</I>&gt;<i> desired&quot;, and the current albeit highly skilled custodians of the web seem
</I>&gt;<i> to sadly lack the vision at the moment to at least point us in that
</I>&gt;<i> direction, let alone have plans to achieve it. I would really like to know
</I>&gt;<i> why others seem not to have seen this problem or reacted to it...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Admittedly, such a concept could, if the existing browser add-on systems
</I>&gt;<i> adequately expose such high privileges to their add-ons, be initially
</I>&gt;<i> implemented itself as an add-on, allowing a cross-browser API initiated from
</I>&gt;<i> websites to trigger the add-on to ask for the granting of website
</I>&gt;<i> privileges, but in order to be well-designed, I would think that this effort
</I>&gt;<i> should fall under the umbrella of a wider, representative, consultative, and
</I>&gt;<i> capable effort, which is supported in principle by the browsers so that at
</I>&gt;<i> the very least they will not end up curtailing privileges to their add-ons
</I>&gt;<i> down the line on which the effort depends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i> Brett
</I>&gt;<i>
