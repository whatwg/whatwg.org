Nothing basically.

It surprises me greatly that Gecko doesn't treat &quot;unicode&quot; as an alias
for &quot;utf-16&quot;.

&gt;<i> Which must
</I>&gt;<i> EITHER mean that many of these pages *are* UTF-16 encoded OR that their

</I>&gt;<i> UTF-8 pages (&quot;UTF-16&quot; should be treated as &quot;UTF-8 when it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;UTF-16&quot;) as WINDOWS-1252, do not affect users too much.
</I>
It's unclear to me if you are talking about HTTP-level charset=UNICODE
or charset=UNICODE in a meta. Is content labeled with charset=UNICODE
BOMless?

&gt;<i> &#160;(2) for the user tests you suggested in Mozilla bug 708995 (above),
</I>&gt;<i> the presence of &lt;meta charset=UNICODE&gt; would trigger a need for Firefox
</I>&gt;<i> users to select UTF-8 - unless the locale already defaults to UTF-8;
</I>
Hmm. The HTML spec isn't too clear about when alias resolution
happens, to I (incorrectly, I now think) mapped only &quot;UTF-16&quot;,
&quot;UTF-16BE&quot; and &quot;UTF-16LE&quot; (ASCII-case-insensitive) to UTF-8 in meta
without considering aliases at that point. Hixie, was alias resolution
supposed to happen first? In Firefox, alias resolution happen after,
so &lt;meta charset=iso-10646-ucs-2&gt; is ignored per the non-ASCII
superset rule.

&gt;&gt;<i> While UTF-8 is possible to detect, I really don't want to take Firefox
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down the road where users who currently don't have to suffer page load
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restarts from heuristic detection have to start suffering them. (I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think making incremental rendering any less incremental for locales
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that currently don't use a detector is not an acceptable solution for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoiding restarts. With English-language pages, the UTF-8ness might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be apparent from the first 1024 bytes.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FIRSTLY, HTML5:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ]] 8.2.2.4 Changing the encoding while parsing
</I>&gt;<i> [...] This might happen if the encoding sniffing algorithm described
</I>&gt;<i> above failed to find an encoding, or if it found an encoding that was
</I>&gt;<i> not the actual encoding of the file. [[
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, trying to detect UTF-8 is second last step of the sniffing
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm. If it, correctly, detects UTF-8, then, while the detection
</I>&gt;<i> probably affects performance, detecting UTF-8 should not lead to a need
</I>&gt;<i> for re-parsing the page?
</I>
Let's consider, for simplicity, the locales for Western Europe and the
Americas that default to Windows-1252 today. If browser in these
locales started doing UTF-8-only detection, they could either:
 1) Start the parse assuming Windows-1252 and reload if the detector says UTF-8.
 2) Start the parse assuming UTF-8 and reload as Windows-1252 if the
detector says non-UTF-8.

(Buffering the whole page is not an option, since it would break
incremental loading.)

Option #1 would be bad, because we'd see more and more reloading over
time assuming that authors start using more and more UTF-8-enabled
tools over time but don't go through the trouble of declaring UTF-8,
since the pages already seem to &quot;work&quot; without declarations.

Option #2 would be bad, because pages that didn't reload before would
start reloading and possibly executing JS side effects twice.

&gt;<i> SECONDLY: If there is a UTF-8 silo - that leads to undeclared UTF-8
</I>&gt;<i> pages, then it is the browsers *outside* that silo which eventually
</I>&gt;<i> suffers (browser that do default to UTF-8 do not need to perform UTF-8
</I>&gt;<i> detect, I suppose - or what?). So then it is partly a matter of how
</I>&gt;<i> large the silo is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, we must consider: The alternative to undeclared UTF-8 pages
</I>&gt;<i> would be to be undeclared legacy encoding pages, roughly speaking.
</I>&gt;<i> Which the browsers outside the silo then would have to detect. And
</I>&gt;<i> which would be more *demand* to detect than simply detecting UTF-8.
</I>
Well, so far (except for sv-SE (but no longer) and zh-TW), Firefox has
not *by default* done cross-silo detection and has managed to get
non-trivial market share, so it's not a given that browsers from
outside a legacy silo *have to* detect.

&gt;<i> However, what you had in min was the change of the default encoding for
</I>&gt;<i> a particular silo from legacy encoding to UTF-8. This, I agree, would
</I>&gt;<i> lead to some pages being treated as UTF-8 - to begin with. But when the
</I>&gt;<i> browser detects that this is wrong, it would have to switch to -
</I>&gt;<i> probably - the &quot;old&quot; default - the legacy encoding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, why would it switch *from* UTF-8 if UTF-8 is the default? We
</I>&gt;<i> must keep the problem in mind: For the siloed browser, UTF-8 will be
</I>&gt;<i> its fall-back encoding.
</I>
Doesn't the first of these two paragraphs answer the question posed in
the second one?

&gt;&gt;<i> It's rather counterintuitive that the persistent autodetection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting is in the same menu as the one-off override.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You talk about View-&gt;Character_Encoding-&gt;Auto-Detect-&gt;Off ? Anyway: I
</I>&gt;<i> agree that the encoding menus could be simpler/clearer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the most counter-intuitive thing is to use the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;auto-detect&quot; about the heuristic detection - see what I said above
</I>&gt;<i> about &quot;behaves automatic even when auto-detect is disabled&quot;. Opera's
</I>&gt;<i> default setting is called &quot;Automatic selection&quot;. So it is &quot;all
</I>&gt;<i> automatic&quot; ...
</I>
Yeah, &quot;automatic&quot; means different things in different browsers.

&gt;&gt;<i> As for heuristic detection based on the bytes of the page, the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heuristic that can't be disabled is the heuristic for detecting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BOMless UTF-16 that encodes Basic Latin only. (Some Indian bank was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believed to have been giving that sort of files to their customers and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it &quot;worked&quot; in pre-HTML5 browsers that silently discarded all zero
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bytes prior to tokenization.) The Cyrillic and CJK detection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heuristics can be turned on and off by the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I always wondered what the &quot;Universal&quot; detection meant. Is that simply
</I>&gt;<i> the UTF-8 detection?
</I>
Universal means that it runs all the detectors that Firefox supports
in parallel, so possible guessing space isn't constrained by locale.
The other modes constrain the guessing space to a locale. For example,
the Japanese detector won't give a Chinese or Cyrillic encoding as its
guess.

&gt;<i> So let's say that you tell your Welsh localizer that: &quot;Please switch to
</I>&gt;<i> WINDOWS-1252 as the default, and then instead I'll allow you to enable
</I>&gt;<i> this brand new UTF-8 detection.&quot; Would that make sense?
</I>
Not really. I think we shouldn't spread heuristic detection to any
locale that doesn't already have it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Within an origin, Firefox considers the parent frame and the previous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document in the navigation history as sources of encoding guesses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That behavior is not user-configurable to my knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> W.r.t. iframe, then the &quot;big in Norway&quot; newspaper Dagbladet.no is
</I>&gt;<i> declared ISO-8859-1 encoded and it includes a least one ads-iframe that
</I>&gt;<i> is undeclared ISO-8859-1 encoded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * If I change the default encoding of Firefox to UTF-8, then the main
</I>&gt;<i> page works but that ad fails, encoding wise.
</I>
Yes, because the ad is different-origin, so it doesn't inherit the
encoding from the parent page.

&gt;<i> * But if I enable the Universal encoding detector, the ad does not fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Let's say that I *kept* ISO-8859-1 as default encoding, but instead
</I>&gt;<i> enabled the Universal detector. The frame then works.
</I>&gt;<i> * But if I make the frame page very short, 10 * the letter &quot;&#248;&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> content, then the Universal detector fails - on a test on my own
</I>&gt;<i> computer, it guess the page to be Cyrillic rather than Norwegian.
</I>&gt;<i> * What's the problem? The Universal detector is too greedy - it tries
</I>&gt;<i> to fix more problems than I have. I only want it to guess on &quot;UTF-8&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> And if it doesn't detect UTF-8, then it should fall back to the locale
</I>&gt;<i> default (including fall back to the encoding of the parent frame).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't that be an idea?
</I>
No. The current configuration works for Norwegian users already. For
users from different silos, the ad might break, but ad breakage is
less bad than spreading heuristic detection to more locales.
