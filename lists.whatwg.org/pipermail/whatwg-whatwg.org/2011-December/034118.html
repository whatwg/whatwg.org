</I>
The reason for this is so that, if the document width later changes
such that one of the excluded stylesheets is now valid, we don't want
to have a noticeable delay while we fire off a network request and
retrieve the new stylesheet.  Remember that widths refer to the
browser window, not the monitor, so small widths *can* (and do) occur
on desktop browsers.

This delay is potentially bad for usability, but more importantly,
it's bad for scripts, as there's a substantial window in which a
&lt;link&gt;'s media query resolves to true, but it either doesn't have an
associated Stylesheet object, or the Stylesheet is a &quot;dummy&quot; that
doesn't yet contain the real values.  Stylesheet access is
synchronous, so we'd have to block the entire JS thread while waiting
for it to come in.
