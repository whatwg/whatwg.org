Indeed.

In HTML, the terms &quot;void&quot; and &quot;empty&quot; are orthogonal.

&quot;Empty&quot; refers to the state of the element's child nodes.

&quot;Void&quot; refers to the syntactic quality of the parser closing the element 
as soon as it sees the start tag, without looking for an end tag.

Here is an empty but not void element:

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here is an empty and void element:

   &lt;br&gt;

Here is a non-empty and not void element:

   &lt;p&gt;x&lt;/p&gt;

Here, a script appends to the document body a non-empty and void element:

   var img = new Image();
   img.textContent = 'x'; // note: creates non-conforming DOM
   document.body.appendChild(img);

The HTML syntax doesn't currently support any way of representing a void 
element that is not empty. Void elements are those that are never allowed 
to be anything but empty, so this is not a relevant limitation.


&gt;<i> The interesting question is: Where do the normative rules say that 
</I>&gt;<i> self-closing syntax must not be used for other than empty elements?
</I>
&quot;Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for 
void elements.&quot;

</I>
While it is indeed more natural to not use the redundant / in HTML, it is 
still conforming, and I believe it is the HTML syntax that the original 
poster was asking about.

&quot;Labeling a resource with the text/html type asserts that the resource is 
an HTML document using the HTML syntax.&quot;

Yes, one is HTML and one is XML. They have only superficial similarities.

</I>
The term has long been overloaded to refer both to elements with no 
children and to elements that do not support an end tag. This was a highly 
confusing overloading of terminology.

(HTML4 falls prey to this problem. For example, consider the sentence &quot;We 
discourage authors from using empty P elements&quot; in section 9.3.1, or the 
phrase &quot;For each empty COLGROUP element&quot; in section 11.2.4.)


&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe void isn't a great term, but empty isn't either.

</I>&gt;<i> In which way is &quot;void&quot; better than &quot;empty&quot;?

It's not better. It's different, which is what matters.

Correct. A user agent can chose to support either or both syntaxes.

&quot;For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications, this 
specification describes two authoring formats: one based on XML (referred 
to as the XHTML syntax), and one using a custom format inspired by SGML 
(referred to as the HTML syntax). Implementations must support at least 
one of these two formats, although supporting both is encouraged.&quot;

No, it's more confusing than the current terminology: &quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; is an empty 
element since it has no content, but p is not a void element&quot;

Indeed.

Agreed.

If anyone has a suggestion for a particularly better name that would make 
it worth the cost of changing, we should definitely consider it. At this 
point thought it might be better to just stick with &quot;void&quot;.
