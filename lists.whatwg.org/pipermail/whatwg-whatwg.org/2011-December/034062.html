&gt;<i> Last I checked, some of those locales defaulted to UTF-8. (And HTML5

Because authors authoring pages that users of those locales tend to use 
use UTF-8 more than anything else?

&gt;<i> Don't users of those locales travel as much as you do?
</I>
People on average travel less than David does, yes.  In all locales.

But that's not the point.  I think you completely misunderstood his 
comments about travel and locales.  Keep reading.

&gt;<i> What kind of trouble are you actually describing here? You are
</I>&gt;<i> describing a problem with using UTF-8 for *your locale*.
</I>
No.  He's describing a problem using UTF-8 to view pages that are not 
written in English.

Now what language are the non-English pages you look at written in? 
Well, it depends.  In western Europe they tend to be in languages that 
can be encoded in ISO-8859-1, so authors sometimes use that encoding 
(without even realizing it).  If you set your browser to default to 
UTF-8, those pages will be broken.

In Japan, a number of pages are authored in Shift_JIS.  Those will 
similarly be broken in a browser defaulting to UTF-8.

&gt;<i> What is your locale?
</I>
Why does it matter?  David's default locale is almost certainly en-US, 
which defaults to ISO-8859-1 (or whatever Windows-??? encoding that 
actually means on the web) in his browser.  But again, he's changed the 
default encoding from the locale default, so the locale is irrelevant.

&gt;<i> (Quite often it sounds as
</I>&gt;<i> if some see Latin-1 - or Windows-1251 as we now should say - as a
</I>&gt;<i> 'super default' rather than a locale default. If that is the case, that
</I>&gt;<i> it is a super default, then we should also spec it like that! Until
</I>&gt;<i> further, I'll treat Latin-1 as it is specced: As a default for certain
</I>&gt;<i> locales.)
</I>
That's exactly what it is.

&gt;<i> Since it is a locale problem, we need to understand which locale you
</I>&gt;<i> have - and/or which locale you - and other debaters - think they have.
</I>
Again, doesn't matter if you change your settings from the default.

&gt;<i> However, you also say that your problem is not so much related to pages
</I>&gt;<i> written for *your* locale as it is related for pages written for users
</I>&gt;<i> of *other* locales. So how many times per year do Dutch, Spanish or
</I>&gt;<i> Norwegian  - and other non-English pages - are creating troubles for
</I>&gt;<i> you, as a English locale user? I am making an assumption: Almost never.
</I>&gt;<i> You don't read those languages, do you?
</I>
Did you miss the &quot;travel&quot; part?  Want to look up web pages for museums, 
airports, etc in a non-English speaking country?  There's a good chance 
they're not in English!

&gt;<i> This is also an expectation thing: If you visit a Russian page in a
</I>&gt;<i> legacy Cyrillic encoding, and gets mojibake because your browser
</I>&gt;<i> defaults to Latin-1, then what does it matter to you whether your
</I>&gt;<i> browser defaults to Latin-1 or UTF-8? Answer: Nothing.
</I>
Yes.  So?

&gt;<i> I think we should 'attack' the dominating locale first: The English
</I>&gt;<i> locale, in its different incarnations (Australian, American, UK). Thus,
</I>&gt;<i> we should turn things on the head: English users should start to expect
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-8 to be used. Because, as English users, you are more used to
</I>&gt;<i> 'mojibake' than the rest of us are: Whenever you see it, you 'know'
</I>&gt;<i> that it is because it is a foreign language you are reading.
</I>
Modulo smart quotes (and recently unicode ellipsis characters).  These 
are actually pretty common in English text on the web nowadays, and have 
a tendency to be in &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;.

&gt;<i> Or, please, explain to us when and where it
</I>&gt;<i> is important that English language users living in their own, native
</I>&gt;<i> lands so to speak, need that their browser default to Latin-1 so that
</I>&gt;<i> they can correctly read English language pages?
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> See? We would have a plan. Or what do you think?
</I>
Try it in your browser.  When I set UTF-8 as my default, there were 
broke quotation marks all over the web for me.  And I'm talking pages in 
English.
