</I>
There's never any guarantee of anything. However, within reason this can 
maintain legibility.


&gt;<i> there's no exposure as to the actual size of the font being used.
</I>
Indeed typically the text would be squeezed, not made smaler.


&gt;<i> It's not (or was not, in the recent past) implemented in many browsers.
</I>
IE9, Chrome, Opera, and Firefox all seem to implement it.


&gt;<i> It serves only minor cases. It's unnecessary.
</I>
It serves pretty much every time you want to put text on a label and are 
pretty sure it'll fit, but it might go slightly over.


&gt;<i> Yes, you can use TextMetrics. So why have this added bloat?
</I>
Convenience. This is a trivial cost for significant convenience.


&gt;<i> Most of your philosophy regarding the Canvas API has been to keep out 
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary and unimplemented items. I don't see how this one is any 
</I>&gt;<i> different.
</I>
It changes multiple lines of code which most authors wouldn't write into 
an additional trivial argument that greatly improves the UI. I think 
that's a pretty good deal.


&gt;<i> If it were intended, to be more useful, I'd want to see it in 
</I>&gt;<i> measureText as well, so that measureText('string', maxWidth) would 
</I>&gt;<i> return a font size attribute.
</I>
We'll be improving measureText's metrics in due course.


&gt;<i> Your use case, in your data chart, could quite easily have been written 
</I>&gt;<i> up without the added attribute. That's why I'm bringing this up.
</I>
It could have been done, but I probably wouldn't have bothered if it 
wasn't an extra argument.
