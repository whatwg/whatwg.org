That sounds like a bug in the browser. No page should cause such problems. 
I don't see such problems with the browsers I use to view the spec.

I've tried to tweak the scripts to not be quite as silly in the way they 
split up the work (in particular, now they won't split up the work if it's 
being done fast -- in browsers I tested, this reduced the problem just to 
the restyling being slow, in some cases taking a few seconds).


For the record, the spec isn't seriously intended to be a &quot;stress test&quot;; 
that is stresses browsers is merely a side-effect of it being a big 
document with lots of complicated scripts and styles. There are (slightly 
less useful) multipage versions of the specs available for people who 
prefer those; they are referenced at the top of the spec, and most links 
to the specs on the whatwg.org site point to those multipage versions.
