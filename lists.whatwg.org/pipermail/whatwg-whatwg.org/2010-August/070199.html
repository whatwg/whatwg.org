[It's Friday, so this is a bit more lighthearted than usual]

Completely correct. I was thinking of FMS (RTMP with dynamic
streaming) and in a momentary lapse of reason [1], wrongly believed
that the server would automatically switch bitrates when the client
hit a certain threshold of dropped frames. It's at least somewhat
ironic given that one of my favorite function names of all time is the
Flash 10 Netstream's play2() [2], which is the flux capacitor of Flash
bitrate switching: it makes dynamic streaming possible [3].

It would still be nice if the &lt;video&gt; made dropped frame information
available, but that's probably not in the cards.

&gt;<i> Microsoft Smooth Streaming also uses a SMIL variant. Is yours compatible?
</I>
Currently no, but perhaps in the future.

&gt;<i> Yes, that sounds like a sensible approach. It's also what Apple do when they
</I>&gt;<i> use Live Streaming: they put the m3u8 file into the @src element. It would
</I>&gt;<i> be nice if that was all we would need to enable adaptive HTTP streaming. It
</I>&gt;<i> might be good to standardise on a baseline file format for the manifest
</I>&gt;<i> though - unless we want to support all types of files that people will come
</I>&gt;<i> up with to do adaptive HTTP streaming.
</I>
Agreed. Right now we only support MRSS, but SMIL and m3u8 would all
work as well. Given that SMIL is a W3C format, it seems to be the
logical choice, no?
