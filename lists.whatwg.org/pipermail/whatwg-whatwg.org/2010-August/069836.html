I would be happy to add such a warning, but I'm not sure I understand the 
attack you had in mind.

Is this the scenario you have in mind?:

   User A controls a laptop within Example Corp's firewall and has a host 
   name of laptop1.corp.example.com.

   User B is also within the firewall.

   Service V is at service.corp.example.com, and it uses document.domain 
   to relax its same-domain restrictions to &quot;example.com&quot;.

   User A tricks User B into visiting a file hosted on his laptop.

   That file relaxes its same-domain restriction to &quot;example.com&quot;, loads 
   service V in an iframe, and uses the DOM to perform an attack on V 
   using B's credentials.
