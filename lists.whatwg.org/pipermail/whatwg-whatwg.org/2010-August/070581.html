I think localisation does have a valid use though. Consider a page
written in English with the date 01/12/2010. Is that date the 1st
December, or the 12th January? The only clue might be the spelling of
certain words in the document, but even then, the most popular office
software in use at the moment defaults to American spelling for its
spell-check feature, even if bought in England, which leads to words
being spelt wrong and giving the reader no good clue as to what the date
might be.

Localisation in this case would mean that I could read the document and
easily figure out what the date was.

Thanks,
Ash
