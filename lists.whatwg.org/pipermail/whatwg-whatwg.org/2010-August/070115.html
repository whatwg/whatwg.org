</I>
It seems self-explanatory... it refers to the units used by the coordinate 
space. What is ambiguous? The coordinate space is defined earlier; its 
size is defined near the top of the &lt;canvas&gt; section, and its direction is 
defined near the top of the '2d' section.


&gt;<i> It is used in the definition of the translate() method, for example, and 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to imply that coordinate space units are affected by scale() 
</I>&gt;<i> operations.
</I>
Nothing is implied in the spec; if something isn't said explicitly, then 
it isn't said and doesn't apply. All that translate() does is change the 
transformation matrix.

&gt;<i> Are &quot;coordinate space units&quot; affected by scaling or not?
</I>
No.


&gt;<i> Are lineWidths supposed to be scaled?
</I>
Yes (&quot;the stroke must itself also be subjected to the current 
transformation matrix&quot;).


&gt;<i> Are shadow offset supposed to be scaled?
</I>
No.


&gt;<i> I think a clearer definition of coordinate spaces would be helpful. 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe &quot;device space&quot; for the underlying pixmap, &quot;canvas space&quot; for the 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates defined by the width and height attributes of the canvas, 
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;user space&quot; for the space defined by the current transformation 
</I>&gt;<i> matrix?
</I>
They are &quot;device pixels&quot;, &quot;coordinate space&quot;, and &quot;coordinates to which 
the current transformation matrix is applied&quot; respectively.

Only if they were low-resolution images.

Yeah. Agreed on both counts.

I generally try to tighten it up when they don't.

It would probably be a lot of work to rewrite this whole section; I'm 
reluctant to do that if there's not a compelling reason to (theoretical 
purity isn't compelling!).
