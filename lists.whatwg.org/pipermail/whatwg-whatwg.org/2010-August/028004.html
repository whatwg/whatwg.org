I've defined an explicit concept of a &quot;media timeline&quot; and defined how you 
use it, which should make a lot of &lt;video&gt;-related issues better.

In theory the new timed track API should let you do this. However, I don't 
really understand why you can't do this in the first place. The 
currentTime shouldn't be changing while things are buffering, so why would 
you be going out of sync?

Indeed.

I would understand it if you couldn't quite determine what the start of 
the stream was, but I don't understand why you wouldn't understand what 
the current time was relative to the start. That is, I understand a fixed 
offset, but I don't see why it would get worse over time. Are you using 
ontimeupdate and currentTime to track the video? Or are you using 
something like setTimeout()?


&gt;<i> However, I think that it's rather hard to find out what the spec means. 
</I>&gt;<i> Because *earliest POSSIBLE*. What is meant by possible? With live 
</I>&gt;<i> streaming it is not possible to go further back in the stream. What do 
</I>&gt;<i> you think? What is meant by this? If it does not help me, then adding a 
</I>&gt;<i> field for getting the _real_ time code data from the video would be very 
</I>&gt;<i> usable.
</I>
The &quot;earliest possible position&quot; is just the earliest position in the 
stream or resource that the user agent can ever obtain again.


&gt;<i> It's talked about in this example: 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#dom-media-starttime">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#dom-media-starttime</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, if two clips have been concatenated into one video file, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but the video format exposes the original times for the two clips, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video data might expose a timeline that goes, say, 00:15..00:29 and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then 00:05..00:38. However, the user agent would not expose those 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; times; it would instead expose the times as 00:15..00:29 and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 00:29..01:02, as a single video.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's well and good, but it would be nice to get the actual time code 
</I>&gt;<i> data for live streaming and these syncing uses if startTime is not the 
</I>&gt;<i> earliest time that exists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Justin Dolske's idea looks rather nice:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems like a somewhat unfortunate thing for the spec, I bet 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone's going to get it wrong because it won't be common. :( I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't help but wonder if it would be better to have a startTimeOffset 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; property, so that .currentTime et al are all still have a timeline 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starting from 0, and if you want the &quot;real&quot; time you'd use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .currentTime + .startTimeOffset.
</I>
I've added a startTimeOffset attribute that returns a Date representing 
the time corresponding to zero on the media element's timeline (as used by 
currentTime and startTime).

What should we do with video files that have multiple overlapping times? 
Just use the first timeline in the file/stream? I've done that for now.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'd also suspect we'll want the default video controls to normalize 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everything to 0 (.currentTime - .startTime), since it would be really 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confusing otherwise.

I've tried, using &quot;should&quot;-level requirements, to require that. (I didn't 
use &quot;must&quot; requirements because I don't know how to make it more precise 
without defining things explicitly in terms of specific video formats.)

It's a little more complicated than that, because the UA is allowed to 
discard old buffered data even if it might never get it back again (as, 
e.g., a DVR might in &quot;live TV&quot; mode), in which case currentTime ranges 
from some non-zero number to duration.

Also, duration can be +Infinity.

I've tried to define in more detail exactly what &quot;zero&quot; on the &quot;current 
playback position&quot; timeline means:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#defineTimeline">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#defineTimeline</A>

Please let me know if that's not what you meant or wanted.


&gt;<i> -- media resources are allowed to have a non-zero &quot;initial playback time&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This is what currentTime should be set to on media load. We could create a
</I>&gt;<i> new DOM attribute to expose this.
</I>
Done (initialTime).


&gt;<i> -- media resources are allowed to have a &quot;real time offset&quot;. This is an 
</I>&gt;<i> optional date+time (in UTC) that corresponds to currentTime=0, exposed 
</I>&gt;<i> as a DOM attribute. Players would be encouraged to use this to display 
</I>&gt;<i> real times, when it's present.
</I>
Done, though I haven't included anything about encouraging people to use 
it... Did you mean for user agents or for scripted players? Or both?


&gt;<i> This would be similar in power to what the spec already has. In your 
</I>&gt;<i> example you could either let currentTime=0 be the start of the stream 
</I>&gt;<i> that the user's loading, and use the &quot;real time offset&quot; to get the 
</I>&gt;<i> correct time displayed, or you could let 0 be the real &quot;start&quot;, and set

</I>&gt;<i> weirdness like the &quot;start time&quot; changing dynamically. It also preserves 
</I>&gt;<i> the invariant that currentTime ranges from 0 to 'duration', which I 
</I>&gt;<i> think players will come to depend on if the cases where it's not true 
</I>&gt;<i> are rare.
</I>
I'm not sure what currentTime=0 would mean in Silvia's example with this.

startTime was just the earliest time you can seek... which means it's 
redundant with seekable.start(0), I guess, or currentTime if you can't 
seek at all. I removed it. Let me know if you have added support and think 
we should keep it, I'm happy to put it back in. It's primary purpose was 
to help people determine what part of the timeline to draw the seek bar 
for (there's no point showing old times you can never seek to), but 
seekable.start(0) does that too, albeit with slightly more work.

I think we still need this as a concept, but I agree we can drop 
startTime.

That was already the case. It might be further limited, though, to a 
range within that range, if there is an explicit timeline in the media 
resource (rare).


&gt;<i> &gt; Is it necessary to have the offset as an absolute date, or could that

I have exposed this.

</I>
I haven't done this, because it would mean requiring support for negative 
times, which seems like it would be a huge source of bugs. (Consider, 
e.g., a streaming server that starts sending you data half-way through the 
resource, but lets you seek back to the start.)


&gt;<i> The difference from what the spec says is that the concept of &quot;earliest
</I>&gt;<i> possible position&quot; is dropped.
</I>
I don't think we can do that, unless we accept that in some cases the 
currentTime might _decrease_ even though playback is going _forward_, 
which seems like a very bad idea.

</I>
Imagine connecting to a streaming live TV service. You'd presumably want a 
DVR-like seek bar that gives you the actual time corresponding to the 
data, not the time relative to when you connected or when they started 
streaming.

Agreed. I've made the API clearly say that &quot;duration&quot; is the time at the 
end, even in the case where the start is not actually zero, to sidestep 
this issue somewhat. (The start will almost always be zero, so the 
slightly misleading name seems like a non-issue.)

Hopefully the spec as written now unambiguously makes use of this.
