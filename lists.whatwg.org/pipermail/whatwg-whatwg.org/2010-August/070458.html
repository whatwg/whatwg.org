</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing from the perspective of the container or the user: detaching an

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page, putting it into hibernation until it's reattached to an active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document/browsing context. What subtle or important facet of the web am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I missing that breaks this analogy? (It wouldn't surprise me if I missed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something obvious, either... :)

</I>&gt;<i> At least in the case of Gecko, there are at least the following things to
</I>&gt;<i> keep in mind:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) &quot;hibernating&quot; documents are very limited in what one can do with
</I>&gt;<i>   them (e.g. attempting to mutate the document in any way while
</I>&gt;<i>   hibernating will throw it away).
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Documents have security policies applied to them based on the
</I>&gt;<i>   toplevel content window (or browser tab, if you prefer to think
</I>&gt;<i>   about it) they're associated with.  Which means that allowing
</I>&gt;<i>   documents not immediately associated with any toplevel window,
</I>&gt;<i>   which would be the case right now in Gecko for an &lt;iframe&gt; not in
</I>&gt;<i>   a document, leads to security problems.  This could be changed by
</I>&gt;<i>   redoing how the association is implemented, but there's some
</I>&gt;<i>   touchy code involved that we'd rather not get wrong.  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Another reason to consider suspending detached iframes: suppose that in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the chat window example below, the iframe wasn't just a same-origin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place to store global state, but also had its own UI, with callbacks and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event handlers and whatnot. If, during the interim while the iframe was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being detached, adopted and reattached, that frame executed a timer that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popped up a modal alert or prompt to the user, how would the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonably know where that alert came from? And what document(s?) should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be paused while the alert is shown?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And for that matter, how would the UA know where the alert came from, in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of correctly parenting it?  This ties back to item #2 above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Couldn't the iframe be kept alive, but remain &quot;associated&quot; with it's parent
browsing context until (if) it was re-parented / inserted into a different
document. (does this match what other elements in the DOM behave in terms of
event handlers when they are detached?)

That way, complex &quot;hibernate&quot; would be uneeded and it would be clear as to
how to handle events, security, etc.
