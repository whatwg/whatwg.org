Sure. What I mean is: you get a video resource through the &lt;video&gt; element
and a list of text resources through the &lt;track&gt; element. If I as a user
want to take away (i.e. download and share with friends) the video file with
the text tracks that I have activated and am currently watching, then I'd
want a download feature that allows me to download a single multiplexed
video file with all the text tracks inside. Something like a MPEG-4 file
with the &lt;track&gt; resources encoded into, say, 3GPP-TT. Or a WebM with WebSRT
encoded (if there will be such a mapping). Or a Ogg file with WebSRT - maybe
encoded in Kate or natively.

The simplest implementation of such a functionality is of course where the
external text track totally matches the format used in the media resource
for encoding text. Assuming WebM will have such a thing as a WebSRT track,
the &quot;download&quot; functionality would then consist of multiplexing a new WebM
resource by re-using the original WebM resource and including the WebSRT
tracks into that. It wouldn't require new video and audio encoding, since
it's just a matter of a different multiplexed container. If transcoding to
the text format in the native container is required, then it's a bit more
complex, but no less so than what we need to do for extracting such data
into a Web page for the JavaScript API (it's in fact the inverse of that
operation).

So, I wouldn't think it's a very complex functionality, but it certainly
seems to be outside the HTML spec and a browser feature, possibly at first
even a browser plugin. Sorry if this is now off topic. :-)

Cheers,
Silvia.
