<PRE>One of our key concerns is with Web SQL Database API (which we prefer) or
Indexed Database API.

I might wish to build an offline web application which will refuse to
operate if the browser cannot guarantee that the database is encrypted. Now
full-disk encryption would be fine (if the O/S has a power-on password), but
how can my web application author detect (using a JS API) if any data stored
in a browser's database is in fact encrypted (or not)?

Such uncertainty might force us (as a vendor) to have to develop
platform/browser-specific plugins to providew an alternative implemantation
of the database API so we can be confident that database storage is secure.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In attempting to use localStorage at work, we ran into some major 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security issues. Primary among those are the guidelines we 
</I>&gt;<i> have in place 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regarding personalized user data. The short story is that 
</I>&gt;<i> personalized 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data cannot be stored on disk unless it's encrypted using a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company-validated encryption mechanism and key. So if we 
</I>&gt;<i> actually wanted 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use localStorage, we'd be forced to encrypt each value as it was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being written and then decrypt each value being read. 
</I>&gt;<i> Because of this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tediousness, we opted not to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing that wouldn't actually help, either, since anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> attacking the user 
</I>&gt;<i> could simply intercept the key and then decrypt it all 
</I>&gt;<i> offline. (In this 
</I>&gt;<i> scenario, I'm assuming the attack being defeated is that of 
</I>&gt;<i> an attacker 
</I>&gt;<i> obtaining the data, and I'm assuming that the attacker has 
</I>&gt;<i> physical access 
</I>&gt;<i> to the computer, since otherwise the Web's security model would be 
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient to block the attack, and that the computer is 
</I>&gt;<i> logged in, since 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise whole-disk encryption would be sufficient to block 
</I>&gt;<i> this attack.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another major issue also relates to the persistence of the data in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; localStorage. Whereas cookies allow you to specify a time 
</I>&gt;<i> at which the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data will be removed, localStorage is there more or less forever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right, it's there for as long as the data that would be saved 
</I>&gt;<i> by the user 
</I>&gt;<i> if the user viewed your page and chose &quot;File &gt; Save As&quot; -- 
</I>&gt;<i> that is, until 
</I>&gt;<i> the user deletes it. (Or until he visits your page again and 
</I>&gt;<i> your page 
</I>&gt;<i> deletes it.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems like any company that takes the security of its 
</I>&gt;<i> data seriously 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would run into the same issues, and rather than forcing 
</I>&gt;<i> every company to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement their own version of the same approach, a common native 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach would be incredibly useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why isn't whole-disk encryption sufficient? It seems like if 
</I>&gt;<i> the user is 
</I>&gt;<i> concerned about his disk being stolen, he'd be concerned 
</I>&gt;<i> about all data on 
</I>&gt;<i> the disk, including his HTTP cache, his cookies, his saved 
</I>&gt;<i> usernames and 
</I>&gt;<i> passwords, etc, not just the data in the Web page's localStorage area.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nicholas is almost certainly discussing the case where the service

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encrypted, not the provider's own computers. (e.g., this could be a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yahoo! policy that data stored on Yahoo! users' computers must be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encrypted).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hence they cannot enforce anything like &quot;use FileVault&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't enforce whole disk encryption, but you are 
</I>&gt;<i> concerned that an 
</I>&gt;<i> attacker could have access to your machine, it seems that there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> solution, since an attacker could just install a rootkit and 
</I>&gt;<i> then carry 
</I>&gt;<i> out arbitrary attacks remotely, including simply replacing 
</I>&gt;<i> the browser 
</I>&gt;<i> with one that intercepts all the user's data as it is written.
