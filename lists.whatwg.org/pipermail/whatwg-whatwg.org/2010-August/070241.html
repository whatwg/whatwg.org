Doing that wouldn't actually help, either, since anyone attacking the user 
could simply intercept the key and then decrypt it all offline. (In this 
scenario, I'm assuming the attack being defeated is that of an attacker 
obtaining the data, and I'm assuming that the attacker has physical access 
to the computer, since otherwise the Web's security model would be 
sufficient to block the attack, and that the computer is logged in, since 
otherwise whole-disk encryption would be sufficient to block this attack.)


&gt;<i> Another major issue also relates to the persistence of the data in 
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage. Whereas cookies allow you to specify a time at which the 
</I>&gt;<i> data will be removed, localStorage is there more or less forever.
</I>
Right, it's there for as long as the data that would be saved by the user 
if the user viewed your page and chose &quot;File &gt; Save As&quot; -- that is, until 
the user deletes it. (Or until he visits your page again and your page 
deletes it.)


&gt;<i> It seems like any company that takes the security of its data seriously 
</I>&gt;<i> would run into the same issues, and rather than forcing every company to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement their own version of the same approach, a common native 
</I>&gt;<i> approach would be incredibly useful.
</I>
Why isn't whole-disk encryption sufficient? It seems like if the user is 
concerned about his disk being stolen, he'd be concerned about all data on 
the disk, including his HTTP cache, his cookies, his saved usernames and 
passwords, etc, not just the data in the Web page's localStorage area.

If you can't enforce whole disk encryption, but you are concerned that an 
attacker could have access to your machine, it seems that there is no 
solution, since an attacker could just install a rootkit and then carry 
out arbitrary attacks remotely, including simply replacing the browser 
with one that intercepts all the user's data as it is written.

That would make more sense, I think. It would be useful in other scenarios 
too (such as replacing &lt;keygen&gt;). I would encourage people interested in 
such an approach to get vendors together and write a spec.
