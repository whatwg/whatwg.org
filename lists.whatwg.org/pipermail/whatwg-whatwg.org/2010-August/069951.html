</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That explains the method name, but I think the most common usage will be to
</I>&gt;<i> exit fullscreen, rather than to cancel a recent request to enter fullscreen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure. But I still want to convey that this is a request, not a command. In
Gecko I'd like to ensure that if a user activated fullscreen via browser UI,
cancelFullScreen will be ignored.


&gt;<i> Why don't requestFullScreen()/requestFullScreenWithKeys() return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a boolean value indicating whether the UA will allow the request
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to proceed? The author has no information about whether fullscreen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is going to happen after making this call, and UAs will certainly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to deny fullscreen in various situations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UA may not be able to make a decision synchronously. Permitting
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous decisions about whether to permit fullscreen was a key goal
</I>&gt;<i> here. For example that gives UAs the option of presenting passive
</I>&gt;<i> confirmation UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. However, I think we need a &quot;fullscreenDenied&quot; event in that case, so
</I>&gt;<i> the author is informed that their request failed for whatever reason. The
</I>&gt;<i> most common cause of failure may be that the UA doesn't allow it (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> WebKit may make this opt-in for embedding applications, so calling this API
</I>&gt;<i> in your RSS reader would result in a denied request).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's probably worth having such an event, but there will be times when
neither fullscreendenied or fullscreenchanged are fired. I hope authors
don't write apps that break in such cases.


&gt;<i> I'd like to see the proposal fleshed out to address the following
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenarios:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and navigation happens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and the content calls requestFullScreen()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  again (possibly with a different element, possibly inside an iframe).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the spec needs to at least say what happens here. Does the second
</I>&gt;<i> call change the fullscreen element to the new element, or is it simply
</I>&gt;<i> ignored?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The spec says that the fullscreen element is changed.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and the fullscreen element is removed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  from the DOM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case I think you'd either exit fullscreen, or update the
</I>&gt;<i> pseudostyles to make the document element the new fullscreen element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The spec currently says that in this case, no element gets the :fullscreen
pseudostyle. I don't see any problem with that. This isn't something useful
for authors to do, so I don't think it really matters what we do here as
long as the result is well-defined and there aren't security issues.


&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and the fullscreen element has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  display:none set on it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess the window just goes blank in this case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, you'll see the page laid out in the viewport.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * consideration of whether the fullscreen API can be called at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  any time (risk of &quot;drive-by-fullscreening&quot;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've talked before about limiting the API so fullscreen can only be
</I>&gt;<i> entered in response to a user event, and I still think that's sensible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is sensible, and we should recommend that behavior, but it may not make
sense for some UAs/UIs so I don't think it should be a hard requirement. Do
we specify popup blocking behavior anywhere? This is just like that.


&gt;<i> Done. In most of those cases, nothing special happens. That is intentional;
</I>&gt;<i> for example, I think trying to special-case handling of display:none or
</I>&gt;<i> focus would quickly add a lot of complexity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you saying that the spec should not prescribe these behaviors? I think
</I>&gt;<i>  the UA should be permitted to exit fullscreen in certain scenarios if it
</I>&gt;<i> deems that necessary for security reasons, as we've discussed before:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-January/024897.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-January/024897.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The spec is completely clear that UAs are allowed to exit fullscreen at any
time, for any of the reasons mentioned in your email or for any other
reason.
