This relies on sites actually using this feature. I don't see any reason 
to believe sites would use this enough to make a dent here.


&gt;<i> 2) If a site allocates small amounts of data on a regular basis for
</I>&gt;<i> various types of caching, and it doesn't expire, it will accumulate
</I>&gt;<i> over time and eventually hit the site's quota.  This will be hard to
</I>&gt;<i> predict and won't show up in testing, since it might only happen after
</I>&gt;<i> months or years of regular use.  Providing a built-in expiration
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism will help authors to avoid this mistake.
</I>
If an author is aware enough to do this, then he's presumably also aware 
enough to just crawl through the existing keys, nuking the ones that are 
no longer in use.


&gt;<i> 3) If client-side data becomes obsolete in a predictable timeframe,
</I>&gt;<i> like server-side expiration of the corresponding credentials, then it
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be used after that date (since it's known that the use will
</I>&gt;<i> fail).  Client-side expiration is a convenient way to model this
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>
That can easily be done without UA support.


I'm not saying there are no use cases here, but the ones listed above 
aren't very compelling in practice, I think. It would be good to know what 
use cases exist that don't have simple workarounds or alternatives.
