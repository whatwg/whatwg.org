&gt;<i> This is feedback on the Mozilla FullScreen API proposal here:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Gecko:FullScreenAPI">https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Gecko:FullScreenAPI</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The user agent may transition a Document into or out of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fullscreen state at any time, whether or not script has requested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it. User agents are encouraged to provide standard UI to exit the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fullscreen state, for example if the user presses the Escape key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this imply that the UA has a &quot;fullscreen&quot; button, when
</I>&gt;<i> the user uses this to make the window fullscreen, then the
</I>&gt;<i> CSS pseudoclasses described in this document are applied?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that's the idea. We want to be able to integrate fullscreen UI with
scripted fullscreen.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure that's always desirable; I think it might result
</I>&gt;<i> in unexpected behavior for users who use the fullscreen button
</I>&gt;<i> as an equivalent to maximizing the window.
</I>
I'd suggest that the CSS pseudoclasses are only applied when the
&gt;<i> fullscreen JS API has been called by the web content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, that's up to the UA; you can have a fullscreen mode that doesn't put
the document into the fullscreen state, if you want.

Note that the API lets authors distinguish &quot;fullscreen with a specific
targeted element&quot; vs &quot;fullscreen with no targeted element&quot;, and a basic
fullscreen UI would only enter the latter mode. So I don't think you'll get
unexpected behavior in practice if they're integrated.

Personally I think they should be integrated. For example, if you have a
canvas game that occupies most of the window except for some instruction
text, and the game has a fullscreen command that makes the canvas fill the
window and resizes the canvas buffer to the window size, I think it would be
nice for the UA's fullscreen UI to trigger the same behavior. Or maybe you
have a slide viewer and you want the UA's fullscreen UI to trigger
fullscreen presentation mode. This API makes that possible.

&gt;<i>  * void cancelFullScreen()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think &quot;exit&quot; would be better than &quot;cancel&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The only problem with &quot;exit&quot; is that you might call it when you're not
actually in fullscreen state, since requests are asynchronous. I think of it
more as cancelling the request than actually forcing a change.

&gt;<i> New methods of Document:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * void requestFullScreen()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * void requestFullScreenWithKeys()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; New methods of Element:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * void requestFullScreen()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * void requestFullScreenWithKeys()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do we really need to add these to both Document and Element?
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like the Document ones could be removed; if an
</I>&gt;<i> author wants to take the Documemnt fullscreen, they simply
</I>&gt;<i> call the methods on document.documentElement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, we can do that. This means getting rid of the concept of not having a
fullscreen element, and instead special-casing the case where the fullscreen
element is the root element in a few places. But I think that's probably a
win. Thanks.

I'm not fan of &quot;WithKeys&quot; in the method names. Out of
&gt;<i> context, it's not clear what &quot;keys&quot; means. I think
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;keyboardInput&quot; or &quot;keyInput&quot; would be more understandable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK.


&gt;<i> Also, why not just use a parameter:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    void requestFullScreen(bool allowKeyboardInput)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
boolean parameters are bad style IMHO. It's hard to tell at the call site
what they mean.

or have some constants for behavior:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    const unsigned short ALLOW_KEYBOARD_INPUT = 1;
</I>&gt;<i>    void requestFullScreen(unsigned short behavior)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be extensible, and would allow us to permit other
</I>&gt;<i> behaviors later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure.

Why don't requestFullScreen()/requestFullScreenWithKeys() return
&gt;<i> a boolean value indicating whether the UA will allow the request
</I>&gt;<i> to proceed? The author has no information about whether fullscreen
</I>&gt;<i> is going to happen after making this call, and UAs will certainly
</I>&gt;<i> want to deny fullscreen in various situations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The UA may not be able to make a decision synchronously. Permitting
asynchronous decisions about whether to permit fullscreen was a key goal
here. For example that gives UAs the option of presenting passive
confirmation UI.

&gt;<i> New content attribute of the &lt;iframe&gt; element:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * allowfullscreen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a boolean attribute. When this attribute is not set, UAs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should ignore fullscreen requests in the iframe or its descendants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Descendant nodes, or descendant iframes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Descendant frames. I'll clarify that.

&gt;<i> * :full-screen-doc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like the abbreviation of &quot;document&quot; here. Would &quot;page&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> be a better term to use than &quot;document&quot; for these?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We can just make it ':full-screen-document'.

&gt;<i>  * :full-screen-doc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While a Document is in the fullscreen state, the 'full-screen-doc'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pseudoclass applies to the root element of that Document.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * :full-screen-doc-with-target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While a Document is in the fullscreen state and the document's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current fullscreen element is an element in the document, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'full-screen-doc-with-target' pseudoclass applies to the root
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; element of that Document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just to be clear, if a document is fullscreen, and the fullscreen
</I>&gt;<i> element is not the document element, then the document element
</I>&gt;<i> will get both these pseudoclasses?
</I>

Correct.

What happens when the
&gt;<i> fullscreen element is the the document element?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As written, it would get all three pseudoclasses. But I think we can get rid
of full-screen-doc-with-target completely.

I'd like to see the proposal fleshed out to address the following
&gt;<i> scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and navigation happens
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>* the document is fullscreen, and the content calls requestFullScreen()

&gt;<i>  again (possibly with a different element, possibly inside an iframe).
</I>&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and the fullscreen element is removed
</I>&gt;<i>  from the DOM
</I>&gt;<i> * the document is fullscreen, and the fullscreen element has
</I>&gt;<i>  display:none set on it.
</I>&gt;<i> * consideration of whether the fullscreen API can be called at
</I>&gt;<i>  any time (risk of &quot;drive-by-fullscreening&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> * affect, if any, on calls to focus() on elements which are not children
</I>&gt;<i>  of the fullscreen element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Done. In most of those cases, nothing special happens. That is intentional;
for example, I think trying to special-case handling of display:none or
focus would quickly add a lot of complexity.

Thanks for the feedback!
