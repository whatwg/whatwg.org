<PRE>2010/8/9 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> I don't understand why I would need an &lt;input type=year&gt; to get this right
</I>&gt;<i> though. If the bank wants something in &#24180;&#21495; it can just let the user type in
</I>&gt;<i> 1985 and convert that via JS to &#26157;&#21644;60&#24180;, no? If anything, having some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> picker seems like it would be more complicated.
</I>

The problem is that it can't do the inserve of that.  What if the user
wanted to type in &quot;&#26157;&#21644;60&#24180;&quot; but server only accepts 1985?  We want some UI for
accepting &quot;&#26157;&#21644;60&#24180;&quot; and automatically convert it to 1985 to submit.  But to
implement that, UA needs to know that certain text field is accepting year,
not some random digits.

I really don't know if it's worth spending time on something that is such a
&gt;<i> minor use case, and can frankly be handled fine without a dedicated input
</I>&gt;<i> type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And niwa-san, on every document I've ever filled out for the Japanese
</I>&gt;<i> government, I've always written 1985&#24180; instead of  &#26157;&#21644;60&#24180; and it's yet to
</I>&gt;<i> cause me any problems ;-) I do understand that there are some sites that
</I>&gt;<i> want it written in the traditional form, but these seem to be precious few
</I>&gt;<i> and far between, and frankly are not the sites I would expect to find HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> form input elements on anyways if the US government is any indication of
</I>&gt;<i> moving to new standards...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But there are users who don't know how to convert from &quot;&#26157;&#21644;xx&#24180;&quot; to year 19xx
(like my parents and grandparents who has to spend at least half a minute
recalling their birth years in Gregorian calendar), and only remember their
birth years in &#26157;&#21644;xx.  Some people even buy a conversion table and keep it in
their wallet just so that they can convert between two systems.  Forcing
them to remember their birth years in 19xx isn't user-friendly and simply a
poor UI localization.

Best,
Ryosuke
