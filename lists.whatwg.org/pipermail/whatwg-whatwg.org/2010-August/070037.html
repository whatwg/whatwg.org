These kinds of heuristics are far beyond the scope of resource
packages as we're planning to implement them.  Again, I think this
type of behavior is the domain of a large change to the networking
stack, such as SPDY, not a small hack like resource packages.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The avatars-on-a-forum use case is less convincing the more I think

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to package up all the avatars into a single package. &#160;So you wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> benefit from the suggested caching changes on those pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why not. &#160;If UAs can assume that files with the same path
</I>&gt;<i> are the same regardless of whether they came from a resource package
</I>&gt;<i> or which, and they have all but a couple of the files cached, they
</I>&gt;<i> could request those directly instead of from the resource package,
</I>&gt;<i> even if a resource package is specified. &#160;So if twenty different
</I>&gt;<i> people post on the page, and you've been browsing for a while and have
</I>&gt;<i> eighteen of their avatars (this will be common, a handful of people
</I>&gt;<i> tend to account for most posts in a given forum):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) With no resource packages, you fetch two separate avatars (but on
</I>&gt;<i> earlier page views you suffered).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) With resource packages as you suggest, you fetch a whole resource
</I>&gt;<i> package, 90% of which you don't need. &#160;In fact, you have to fetch a
</I>&gt;<i> resource package even if you have 100% of the avatars on the page! &#160;No
</I>&gt;<i> two pages will be likely to have the same resource package, so you
</I>&gt;<i> can't share cache at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) With resource packages as I suggest, you fetch only two separate
</I>&gt;<i> avatars, *and* you got the benefits of resource packages on earlier
</I>&gt;<i> pages. &#160;The UA gets to guess whether using resource packages would be
</I>&gt;<i> a win on a case-by-case basis, so in particular, it should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> perform strictly better than either (1) or (2), given decent
</I>&gt;<i> heuristics. &#160;E.g., the heuristic &quot;fetch the resource package if I need
</I>&gt;<i> at least two files, fetch the file if I only need one&quot; will perform
</I>&gt;<i> better than either (1) or (2) in any reasonable circumstance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this sort of situation will be fairly common. &#160;Has anyone
</I>&gt;<i> looked at a bunch of different types of web pages and done a breakdown
</I>&gt;<i> of how many assets they have, and how they're reused across pages? &#160;If
</I>&gt;<i> we're talking about assets that are used only on one page (image
</I>&gt;<i> search) or all pages (logos, shared scripts), your approach works
</I>&gt;<i> fine, but not if they're used on a random mix of pages. &#160;I think a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of files will wind up being used on only particular subsets of pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, I think we need something like SPDY to really address the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem of duplicated downloads. &#160;I don't think resource packages can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fix it with any caching policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly there are limits to what resource packages can do, but we
</I>&gt;<i> can wind up closer to the limits or farther from them depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation details.
