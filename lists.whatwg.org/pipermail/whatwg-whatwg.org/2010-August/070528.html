</I>
I could have been more clear.  I am suggesting that a different tab page would not be &quot;navigation&quot; in the common sense, as the user is not leaving the current page, just switching contexts within the application.  Another example might be where a tabstrip is used informationally, without attached behavior, to indicate perhaps which step of a process a user is currently on.

A list of tabs differs from a list of links, because when selecting a tab the user expects the change to stay within a greater context.  If I am logged into a CMS and viewing a blog article, tabs may be View, Edit, Track Changes, etc.  As a tabstrip I expect these actions to be meaningful within the current context of the article.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Unless a list item can receive a selected attribute, then we would still have no method of presenting information about the selected tab through markup alone.  Commonly the selected tab is given a class such as &quot;tab-selected&quot; and this meaning is communicated through style alone.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, as a matter of fact a tabstrip element could contain list items, one of which could be selected.  Tabstrips are essentially a different type of list, and there is currently no method of communicating this in html5.

Thanks,
Everett
