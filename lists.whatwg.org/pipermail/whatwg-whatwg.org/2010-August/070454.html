</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it make more sense to consider the br element to be just a

</I>
Calling it a &quot;line break&quot; doesn't say how it is rendered. It's just a 
conceptual description.

(A &quot;minor logical break inside a paragraph&quot; is not generally represented 
by a line break, at least not in any typographic conventions I've seen; 
usually, in my experience, those are denoted either using ellipses, 
em-dashes, or parentheses.)


&gt;<i> In addition, the appropriate uses (poems, addresses) and examples 
</I>&gt;<i> currently given are not convincing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider this:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;P. Sherman&lt;br&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 42 Wallaby Way&lt;br&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sydney&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's no reason why line breaks should be part of an address. I've 
</I>&gt;<i> seen many addresses on one line with their parts separated just by dots 
</I>&gt;<i> or pipes.
</I>
Those are line breaks.


&gt;<i> Given the inherent structure of an address, a definition list 
</I>&gt;<i> with name/value pairs would also be more semantically fitting than a 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph of text with line breaks.
</I>
I don't know about that. When you look up the formal way to write an 
address, it's not a set of name-value pairs. It's a set of lines. For 
example, from the UK post office site:

   <A HREF="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/portal/po/content1?catId=19100182&amp;mediaId=95100765">http://www.postoffice.co.uk/portal/po/content1?catId=19100182&amp;mediaId=95100765</A>


&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt;
</I>
(Note, by the by, that &lt;address&gt;, despite its name, is about page contact 
information, not about postal addresses.)


&gt;<i> 	&lt;dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 		&lt;dt&gt;Name&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;P. Sherman&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 		&lt;dt&gt;Street&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;42 Wallaby Way&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 		&lt;dt&gt;City&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Sydney&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;/dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/address&gt;
</I>
That would be fine, but isn't how you write an address.


&gt;<i> Or just:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 		&lt;dd&gt;P. Sherman&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 		&lt;dd&gt;42 Wallaby Way&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 		&lt;dd&gt;Sydney&lt;/dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;/dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/address&gt;
</I>
The latter is very wrong, there's no &quot;name&quot; part!


&gt;<i> Regarding poems, line breaks have conventionally been used in Western 
</I>&gt;<i> literature to aid in manifesting the rhythm. And there surely are many 
</I>&gt;<i> poems that use formatting for artistic effect.
</I>
Indeed, see the example under &lt;pre&gt;.


&gt;<i> But I think it would be hard to say that *line* breaks are an inherent 
</I>&gt;<i> part of poems per se. I'd say that breaks are important means to 
</I>&gt;<i> determine structure, but line breaks are just one of many possible 
</I>&gt;<i> manifestations of such breaks.
</I>
I have spoken to poets who would strongly disagree with you, but that's 
academic -- there's nothing that says that &lt;br&gt; has to map to a physical 
new line. It's just a conceptual line break.


&gt;<i> Just like in a musical score where the bar is present in sheet music but 
</I>&gt;<i> not in the actual music being played.
</I>
I don't know that those are equivalent to line breaks.


&gt;<i> Interestingly, the examples given for where not to use br look like 
</I>&gt;<i> great examples to actually use a break element (not necessarily a line 
</I>&gt;<i> break).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First example:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;&lt;a ...&gt;34 comments.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a ...&gt;Add a comment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two separate pieces of text that belong together (they are 
</I>&gt;<i> both related to comments). So using one paragraph to group them is fine. 
</I>&gt;<i> But they can benefit from a separation that is a bit stronger than just 
</I>&gt;<i> punctuation since one of them is purely informational and the other is a 
</I>&gt;<i> call to action. This is where a break element is perfect. One designer 
</I>&gt;<i> might want a line break. So he should be able to set a line break 
</I>&gt;<i> property on that break. Another designer doesn't like line breaks. So 
</I>&gt;<i> let her set the break to be generated as a green, medium-sized dot.
</I>
I disagree. Here the break is purely presentational and has nothing to do 
with the semantic of the information.


&gt;<i> Second example:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Name: &lt;input name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;label&gt;Address: &lt;input name=&quot;address&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although I also prefer the version without the br element, I must say 
</I>&gt;<i> that a form is the one element where presentational markup does make 
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>
But &lt;br&gt; is not presentational.


&gt;<i> By its very nature a form has an explicit design, otherwise it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> called free-form. Granted, in web design there usually isn't and 
</I>&gt;<i> probably shouldn't be such a strong form character as in paper-based 
</I>&gt;<i> forms.
</I>
I do not agree with the premise of this argument.


&gt;<i> So, in summary, I suggest changing the br element to just be a logical 
</I>&gt;<i> break element with the default rendition of a line break, but which 
</I>&gt;<i> could be adjusted via a new style property.
</I>
That's already what it is. I've added a note to make this clearer.

That's what it represents, but it's still not legal.

   br { content: '|'; }

...is the way to do that, once we've got CSS3 Generated Content done.

That's a good example of line breaks not being presentational!

Indeed, those are all fine renderings of the same markup.


&gt;<i> Street number: 123
</I>&gt;<i> Street: Imaginary Place
</I>&gt;<i> City: New York
</I>&gt;<i> State: NY
</I>&gt;<i> Zip code: 12345

It's the same underlying data, but it's not the same content, IMHO.

Sounds like a line break to me. :-) Would you say a pause between runs of 
text is not a paragraph break, because there's no block of text when 
reading a book?

I don't know about _that_. It's easy to read poetry in a way that clearly 
has line breaks. (It's not necessarily a good way to read poetry, but 
that's besides the point.)

Well, there are a few use cases (like addresses and some poems) where &lt;br&gt; 
is appropriate but where the underlying data is not preformatted text (so 
&lt;pre&gt; isn't suitable).
