The user can't edit the value of &lt;output&gt;, so the only time this would be 
helpful is when you have script, with the script setting the validity 
using setCustomValidity(). But then the script can just as easily set it 
on the control that's actually making the output be invalid. That would 
also be better UI -- having the user agent point out the &lt;output&gt; control 
is invalid would likely just infuriate users who couldn't tell what they 
had to do to change the value.

Not quite nothing -- they have it so that you can iterate through 
form.elements and use the constraint validation API on all of them.

Right.

I don't understand. Why does it matter?

It only changes this in theory. In practice the result is the same as far

The script setting the value doesn't set the dirty flag. The only way this 
could be a problem is if the user edits the control and _then_ the script 
sets the value to an overlong value.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should the spec (and WebKit) be changed here, or should Opera change?
</I>
WebKit is wrong here. Opera matches the spec as far as I can tell. The 
submission should only be blocked if the user edits the value before 
onload in these examples.

Indeed. The same occurs if the author writes &lt;input pattern=' '&gt; -- it 
will only work if the user types in a single space.


&gt;<i> I do not imagine an author would like to make its element always invalid 
</I>&gt;<i> and even if it is, I think most people will try to write pattern='' to

</I>
Presumably they would find pretty quickly that they were wrong to think 
that would work. :-)


&gt;<i> If someone wants to make the element invalid when the value is not

I'm generally not a fan of doing such magic... for every author who will 
find it works as they expect, I think there'll be another author wondering 
why his attribute is ignored. However, as always, I may be wrong about 
this! Has anyone here tried using pattern=&quot;&quot; to disable the attribute?

This is very useful, thanks.

We could work around the last one by having a script-set value clear the 
&quot;dirty&quot; flag. The other two are harder short of using another attribute 
than required=&quot;&quot;.

I haven't changed anything yet. If this becomes untenable, let me know.

</I>
That's a good point. Ok. Let's add it now.

The use case here is having a &lt;select&gt; which has a bunch of options, none 
of which are selected initially, and require that the user pick one.

For list boxes, this is trivial.

For drop-down boxes (size=1), this request is usually paired with a 
request for a placeholder-like inline label indicating to the user that he 
must select an option, so what we really want is something like:

   &lt;select name=&quot;...&quot; placeholder=&quot;Label&quot;&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;1&quot;&gt; Value 1 &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;2&quot;&gt; Value 2 &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Value 3 &lt;/option&gt;
    ...
   &lt;/select&gt;

...but then the first &lt;option&gt; gets selected and the label isn't shown, 
unless we say that a placeholder means no &lt;option&gt; gets selected 
automatically. That unfortunately isn't very usefully backwards- 
compatible, so that's out.

People today do:

   &lt;select name=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;&quot;&gt; Label &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;1&quot;&gt; Value 1 &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;2&quot;&gt; Value 2 &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Value 3 &lt;/option&gt;
    ...
   &lt;/select&gt;

Today this is suboptimal, because &quot;Label&quot; isn't really an option, but we 
can define the first &lt;option&gt; of a &lt;select size=1 required&gt; to be a label 
if it has its value=&quot;&quot; attribute set to the empty string and isn't 
disabled and isn't in an &lt;optgroup&gt;.

This has the benefit of paving a cowpath and being minimally invasive in 
terms of required changes to pages.

I have now specified this.

The way I have specified it, value=&quot;&quot; can still be used:

   &lt;select required&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;&quot;&gt;Choose one:&lt;/option&gt; &lt;!-- that's the label --&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;&quot;&gt;None&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;!-- this is the first option --&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value=&quot;peach&quot;&gt;Peach&lt;/option&gt;

I have a note in the spec to add a feature at some point to track what 
controls have been changed and what haven't, but that doesn't seem to have 
the need for urgency that Jonas describes required=&quot;&quot; as having, so I 
still think we should keep delaying that one until browsers have caught up.
