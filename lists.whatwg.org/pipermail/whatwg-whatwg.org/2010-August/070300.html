</I>&gt;<i> I just came across a curious situation in the spec: IIUC, it seems the

</I>&gt;<i> Webpage has to use JavaScript to turn down (or up) the loudness of their

</I>&gt;<i> through content attributes.
</I>
What is the use case for overriding the user's defaults in this way?

I guess I could see a use case for muting (e.g. video ads often start 
off muted), but declaring the default volume seems very strange.


&gt;<i> However, if I have multiple videos on a page, all on autoplay, it would 
</I>&gt;<i> be nice to turn off the sound of all of them without JavaScript. With 
</I>&gt;<i> all the new CSS3 functionality, I can, for example, build a spinning 
</I>&gt;<i> cube of video elements that are on autoplay or a marquee of videos on 
</I>&gt;<i> autoplay - all of which would require muting the videos to be bearable. 
</I>&gt;<i> If we added @muted to the content attributes, it would be easy to set 
</I>&gt;<i> the muted state without having to write any JavaScript.
</I>
I guess that could make sense.

Would we want to make .muted simply reflect the content attribute, so 
that the user enabling/disabling muting changes how the DOM is serialised? 
Or would we go for another attribute, say mute=&quot;&quot;, as the default, and 
have the IDL attribute be set by that attribute when loading, and then be 
independent of it? The latter seems better I guess.


&gt;<i> As for the @volume attribute, I think it would be similarly useful if an 
</I>&gt;<i> author could control the loudness at which a video or audio file starts 
</I>&gt;<i> playing back, in particular if he/she knows it is actually a fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> loud/quiet file.
</I>
Given that the default is 1.0 (the loudest setting), it would only really 
let authors make things quieter. It's not clear that there are that many 
use cases for that.

I don't know that I'd agree with that really. It's not purely 
presentational -- the concept applies regardless of how the video is 
presented, so long as it has an audio component.

(Note that CSS3 Speech doesn't apply here, since that's specifically for 
audio browsers, not for screen browsers that happen to play audio.)

</I>
You'd have to include the controls=&quot;&quot; attribute for that, but yes, indeed.

Yeah.

What if you notice that each file uses different fonts for titles, or each 
video is colour-corrected differently, or uses a different lens, or has a 
different aspect ratio, or four are filmed during the day and one during 
the night and the latter one really stands out in a bad way? I don't think 
we should assume that just because we can do post-processing in the 
client, it's the right thing to do. :-)

</I>
Yeah, this is a trade-off. We wanted to have one event that fired for 
both, because otherwise it's easy to make UI that fails to take into 
account that there are two things going on. But we also didn't want to 
fire multiple events per change, because that makes it really easy to end 
up in a situation where by the time you receive the event, the current 
situation has changed (since the events get queued). I'm not sure what the 
best situation is. I intend to look at how people use onvolumechange over 
the next year or so and see how much trouble this is causing.
