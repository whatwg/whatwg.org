<PRE>On Thu, 26 Aug 2010 11:52:26 +0200, Henri Sivonen &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">hsivonen at iki.fi</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Why wouldn't it always be a superior solution for all parties to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  1) Make sure WebSRT never requires processing that'd require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  rendering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a substantial body of legacy .srt content in a broken way. (This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; require supporting non-UTF-8 encodings by sniffing as well as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; supporting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;font&gt; and &lt;u&gt;, which would happen &quot;for free&quot; if my innerHTML
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; were adopted.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  2) Make playback software that supports WebSRT only have a WebSRT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; path and use that code path for legacy .srt content as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Specifically, if #1 is done, why would any pragmatic developer not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to do #2 if they are supporting WebSRT in their software? Why would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; anyone want to have a code path that turns off new WebSRT features
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they have a code path that supports WebSRT features?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think many media player developers would be hesitant to include a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> full
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML parser just for parsing (Web)SRT, especially since they'd also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> layout engine to get anything more than they would get from a simpler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If their app can ingest both WebSRT and legacy SRT (with WebSRT ingested  
</I>&gt;<i> by whatever potentially spec-incompliant means), why would they not use  
</I>&gt;<i> the same ingest code path for both?
</I>
I don't they should or would, I'm just saying that they'd probably be  
hesitant to use an HTML parser in that single code path, as there's very  
little benefit for them.

&gt;<i> If the app isn't capable of supporting any feature that's permitted in  
</I>&gt;<i> WebSRT but not part of legacy SRT, how does failing at the point of  
</I>&gt;<i> finding out that &quot;this file claims to be WebSRT rather than SRT&quot; make  
</I>&gt;<i> things much better than failing at &quot;I found stuff that I can't  
</I>&gt;<i> handle/skip over in this SRT file&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, it seems like a wrong optimization to make it possible  
</I>&gt;<i> for apps that don't support any WebSRT features over legacy features to  
</I>&gt;<i> fail early than to make apps that support at least one WebSRT-introduced  
</I>&gt;<i> feature unify their processing of WebSRT and SRT by processing both  
</I>&gt;<i> WebSRT and SRT as one format where legacy SRT files just don't happen to  
</I>&gt;<i> use new features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, having different code paths for WebSRT and SRT is like IE adding  
</I>&gt;<i> a new Trident snapshot with every release whereas supporting SRT by  
</I>&gt;<i> treating it as WebSRT with no new features (if the app is supporting  
</I>&gt;<i> even one WebSRT-introduced feature!) is like what the other browsers are  
</I>&gt;<i> doing with HTML/CSS/DOM.
</I>
Is this in reply to something other than what you quoted? In any case, I  
agree.
