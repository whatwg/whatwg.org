<PRE>
There was some recent feedback on the &lt;img alt&gt; attribute. I have quoted 
some of it below. I haven't changed the spec: none of the points raised 
were new information.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My personal opinion on the alt attribute is that:
</I>&gt;<i> - it should only be used if the image is crucial for understanding the
</I>&gt;<i> content, or for navigation (such as headline or link images or charts)
</I>&gt;<i> - it's absence should default to what is alt=&quot;&quot; in HTML4
</I>&gt;<i> - search engines should generally ignore text in the alt attribute, but
</I>&gt;<i> evaluate the title attribute instead
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rationale:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.1.1.12 says: &quot;A corollary to this is that the alt attribute's value should
</I>&gt;<i> never contain text that could be considered the image's caption, title, or
</I>&gt;<i> legend. It is supposed to contain replacement text that could be used by users
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the image; it is not meant to supplement the image. The title
</I>&gt;<i> attribute can be used for supplemental information.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most common use cases of @alt are (at least as far as I know from my
</I>&gt;<i> authoring practise):
</I>&gt;<i> - Insert the text contained in a headline or link image
</I>&gt;<i> - Insert an empty string to make the page validate
</I>&gt;<i> - Insert a short description of the image, preferably containing some keywords
</I>&gt;<i> for search engines; sometimes the search engine aspect is weighted even higher
</I>&gt;<i> than the contents of the image here
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only the first one of these use cases matches the gideline given in
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.1.1.12. The second one is not harmful, exept some minimal bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> impact. But the third one is actually counterproductive with regard to
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An image which conveys information, if it is not a text replacement (such as a
</I>&gt;<i> headline or link image), a corporate logo, or some kind of chart, is usually
</I>&gt;<i> almost impossible to describe in a way that can't be considered the image's
</I>&gt;<i> caption, title, or legend. Usually, the information conveyed by the image is
</I>&gt;<i> either duplicated in the text that the image is associated to (or in it's
</I>&gt;<i> caption or legend), or at all useless for anybody that does not see the image.
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, the presence of an alt text does not provide useful information,
</I>&gt;<i> but possibly confuses - specially if it is written with regard to search
</I>&gt;<i> engines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am confident that declaring the alt attribute as optional would not only
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the spec and validation, but also have no significant effect
</I>&gt;<i> regarding accessibility, as poor authoring cannot really be prevented by
</I>&gt;<i> structural means.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I am also confident that if search engines ignored the alt attribute, and
</I>&gt;<i> authors were encouraged to only insert alt text if helps to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> content, this would have a positive effect on accessibility, as authors would
</I>&gt;<i> be discouraged to put unnecessary information in the alt attribute for seo
</I>&gt;<i> purposes, or duplicate the legend or caption (what I used to do before I read
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.1.1.12, because HTML4 seemed to require exactly this).

</I>&gt;<i> What you said doesn't make sense. The alt text is to be used instead of

</I>&gt;<i> engines should use alt text, as that is what they are attempting to 
</I>&gt;<i> convey in the lost (in the sense that search engines don't process 
</I>&gt;<i> images like they do text) image. If they used the title, one can only 
</I>&gt;<i> imagine the trouble.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, maybe the search engine aspect obfuscates the main statement I 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to make; let's just drop it and try to be some more specific.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.1.1 says: &quot;Except where otherwise specified, the alt attribute must 
</I>&gt;<i> be specified and its value must not be empty; the value must be an 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate replacement for the image. The specific requirements for the 
</I>&gt;<i> alt attribute depend on what the image is intended to represent, as 
</I>&gt;<i> described in the following sections.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the sub sections, many cases are stated where the alt attribute must 
</I>&gt;<i> be set to the empty string, and some cases where the alt attribute can 
</I>&gt;<i> even be omitted. These seem to be the ones that are considered to be too 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point is, that it would simplify things (e.g. the cases treated in the
</I>&gt;<i> links Tantek provided) a lot to do it the other way around:
</I>&gt;<i> - Declare the alt attribute as optional, and default a missing alt attribute
</I>&gt;<i> to alt=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - Explicitly specify the cases where the alt attribute must be set (e.g.: if
</I>&gt;<i> the image is the only child of an &lt;a&gt; or &lt;h1-6&gt; element)
</I>&gt;<i> - Update some of the authoring guidance in the sense of encouraging authors to
</I>&gt;<i> apply alt text where appropriate, and omit it where not (I specially think of
</I>&gt;<i> 4.8.1.1.9 here; I will post a separate proposal about this section)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that there is much benefit in the requirement for the alt attribute,
</I>&gt;<i> for the following reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> - The paedagogig aspect of making a document invalid if an alt attribute is
</I>&gt;<i> omitted is obsolete, as authors have got used to just insert alt=&quot;&quot; if they
</I>&gt;<i> are too lazy to write an alternative text, and many authoring tools even
</I>&gt;<i> insert the empty string by default if the author does not specify an alt text.
</I>&gt;<i> Bad authoring cannot be prevented by structural specification.
</I>&gt;<i> - I have no personal experience using screen readers or text-only browsers,
</I>&gt;<i> but I am quite sure that unnecessary (not speaking of inadequate) alt text is
</I>&gt;<i> not helpful, but even harmful as it interrupts the reading or listening flow.
</I>&gt;<i> (If screen reader or braille browser users contradict me here, I am happy to
</I>&gt;<i> learn, of course.)

</I>&gt;<i> the image is not something which should appear in the flow of text at 
</I>&gt;<i> that position. HTML5 brings many new layout devices which can help lay 
</I>&gt;<i> out the code in a logical and coherent manner, while still rendering on 
</I>&gt;<i> screen in the traditional manner. I do test thing in text browsers, and 
</I>&gt;<i> frequently see bad alt text markup on sites along the lines of 
</I>&gt;<i> alt=&quot;Company Logo&quot; or somesuch, where in-fact it should have read 
</I>&gt;<i> alt=&quot;ACME Trading Co.&quot; because that is the text that was on the image 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that there is a lot of bad markup out there with lots of empty 
</I>&gt;<i> alt attributes, inserted only to pass the validators, but I think making 
</I>&gt;<i> the attribute optional would just cause further accessibility issues. 
</I>&gt;<i> Better to improve the validators to give warnings about empty alt 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes (only warnings rather than outright errors) to notify the 
</I>&gt;<i> developer that there could be a potential issue with the markup.
