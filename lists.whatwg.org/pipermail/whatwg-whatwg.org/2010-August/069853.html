What problem would this solve?

</I>&gt;<i> Also someone wrote that one should use &lt;object&gt; for media-types that

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;audio&gt;, think of this as a way for second-class media-types WHATWG 
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't approved/haven't been implemented to use some of the features of 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;.
</I>
I don't understand these paragraphs at all.

Indeed, with those you have to provide the fallback content (which could 
e.g. be flash) as a descendant of the &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt; element.


&gt;<i> 	What I'm trying to write is that not all browsers support 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript, not all pages must be able to control playback more than 
</I>&gt;<i> play, pause, seek etc and that a mechanism for linking to files and 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative encodings thereof semantically. Currently, that seems to be

</I>&gt;<i> that adds no extra interface, you get this for all other types as well 
</I>&gt;<i> (albeit with a lesser scripting interface). Although the &lt;include&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element won't be as good integration point between one media and 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, it will have a standard interface somewhat applicable to many 
</I>&gt;<i> medias/mediums and at least provide something to all medias, versus 
</I>&gt;<i> (close to) nothing.
</I>
I'm not sure I follow. If you're saying that we should also support other 
timed-based formats in the future even if they are not video, e.g. if you 
are saying we should support formats like SMIL, then there's no reason you 
can't do that with &lt;video&gt; itself. &lt;video&gt; really is just an API to 
time-based visual data, it doesn't have to be a sequence of bitmaps.


I didn't really follow the rest of your e-mail. It would be helpful if you 
could construct your feedback in the form of a problem faced by users, 
rather than in the form of a proposed solution. This would enable the 
proposal to be properly evaluated.

</I>
I don't really see how. In what sense do they add new linking 
capabilities?
