I'm afraid my confusion is only deepening; you didn't say anything about
&quot;what [we] actually require&quot; (why would you; the examples I gave
demonstrated that the facility to input 1-, 2- and 3-digit and BC dates is
currently required); you said that the examples I gave were not &quot;best
practice in any way, shape or form&quot;.

</I>
I don't recall anyone asking for &quot;handling every date representation known
to man&quot;. On the other hand, I have demonstrated a requirement to be able
to input every date known to man.
