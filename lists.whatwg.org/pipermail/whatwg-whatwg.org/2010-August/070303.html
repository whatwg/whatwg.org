<PRE>
Controlling the rendering of content, e.g. as being full-screen or not, is 
a presentation-specific concern (e.g. it doesn't even apply to a speech- 
based browser, with no loss of features to the user), so the right place 
to specify it is something like CSSOM, not HTML. Thus, I haven't added 
anything to the HTML spec.

Having said that:

</I>
By CSSOM, I mean a separate specification, specifically one from the 
family of specifications that Anne is working on:

   <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/">http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/</A>
   <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/">http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/</A>

...though my understanding is that Anne doesn't have the bandwidth to take 
this on right now (this may be less of a problem if Robert's proposal can 
just be taken wholesale, though).


&gt;<i> While I would guess this would be a CSSOM issue, it seems that it would 
</I>&gt;<i> still be a recommendation by WHATWG.
</I>
If anyone would like to volunteer to edit such a specification, I would be 
more than happy to help set that up. Anne would probably also be happy to 
help, in particular with regard to coordinating with the CSS working group 
(who are nominally in charge of this particular area).

This proposal seems essentially sound.

If this is the direction we go in, I'll be happy to add onfullscreenchange 
to the list of event handlers.

One comment: Rather than adding an &quot;allowfullscreen&quot; attribute on 
&lt;iframe&gt;, I would suggest just assuing that sandboxed content (i.e. 
content of iframes with the sandbox=&quot;&quot; attribute) can't go fullscreen. I 
can provide a sandbox flag for this state. If we think there are use cases 
for allowing sandboxed iframes to go fullscreen, then I can also add a 
keyword that turns off the flag when present (like &quot;allow-scripts&quot; does 
for scripts). (I'm assuming there are no cases for disabling fullscreen 
for unsandboxed iframes; are there?)
