</I>
I'm not really convinced that this makes it a storage API, nor am I 
convinced that we should make all the storage mechanisms have the same 
API, even if it did.


&gt;<i> There should be good reasons why not to reuse existing API patterns.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is &quot;pushState&quot; inventing a new API pattern where a copy of the state 
</I>&gt;<i> is forwarded through new methods and events, instead of accessing it 
</I>&gt;<i> through a storage facade (see sessionStorage and localStorage) as in 
</I>&gt;<i> WebStorage?
</I>
Well, it was defined first, to start with. :-)


&gt;<i> Why is &quot;pushState&quot; defining a more restrictive model to state access 
</I>&gt;<i> (read once / write anytime) compared to WebStorage (read anytime / write 
</I>&gt;<i> anytime) ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What use-cases are solvable in the current &quot;pushState&quot; model but not in 
</I>&gt;<i> a WebStorage-style model? (see below for WebStorage-style example)
</I>
There are often many ways to solve these kinds of problems. When 
pushState() was designed, it was envisioned as a mechanism to annotate the 
session history, which is why it ended up being the way it is.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand how this would work. When does the history 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get updated in this model?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The pushState method (without state parameter and possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> renamed) remains to create a new session history entry:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   function() {
</I>&gt;<i>     history.state.setItem(&quot;a&quot;, 1); // set on current history entry
</I>&gt;<i>     history.pushState(title, url); // create new history entry
</I>&gt;<i>     history.state.getItem(&quot;a&quot;); // get from new history entry (null)
</I>&gt;<i>     history.state.setItem(&quot;a&quot;, 2); // set on new history entry
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do you know you've gone back in history? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The popstate event (without state attribute) remains to inform 
</I>&gt;<i> us that history entry has been switched and that the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> data is now available through history.state.
</I>
Yeah, we could have done it that way. I don't know that it's better or 
worse, personally.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> pushState and replaceState take three arguments: An opaque data object,

</I>&gt;<i> what we can do to clean up this API, since having an unused parameter in 
</I>&gt;<i> our brand-new functions is unfortunate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, we might change the pushState and replaceState methods 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, perhaps changing them so they only take a URL and an 
</I>&gt;<i> optional data object.  But since Chrome and Safari have already shipped 
</I>&gt;<i> the method, and since we hear that the functions are already being used 
</I>&gt;<i> on the web, it's probably too late to add or remove arguments from the 
</I>&gt;<i> functions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the intent of the spec as it stands is that the title 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter should show up in the session history list (shown e.g. when 
</I>&gt;<i> you click the down arrow next to the forward button), but not in the 
</I>&gt;<i> application's title bar.  We think this is confusing (as evidence, 
</I>&gt;<i> observe that two browsers skipped this step!) and adds a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> complexity for a small amount of gain, so we're not in favor of this 
</I>&gt;<i> approach.  If modifying the document's title in the session history list 
</I>&gt;<i> is a desirable feature, then we could expose that property to the DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> just as we expose document.title.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seeing as we're stuck with the title argument in pushState and 
</I>&gt;<i> replaceState, we propose that it modify document.title in an intuitive 
</I>&gt;<i> way:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Before we unload a history entry, we save document.title into the 
</I>&gt;<i> history entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * When we activate a history entry, we set document.title to the value 
</I>&gt;<i> stored in the history entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * When we pushState, we set document.title to the title parameter after 
</I>&gt;<i> activating the new history entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * When we replaceState, we set document.title to the title parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the last two cases, if the title parameter is empty, we leave 
</I>&gt;<i> document.title unchanged.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We think this is a good compromise between complexity and functionality.
</I>
This seems reasonable. Try it. If it works I'll spec it. :-)

I would recommend that browsers experiment with what the most useful thing 
to do with this argument is. I'm happy to spec whatever gets implemented.

</I>&gt;<i> - Chrome will not create a session history entry if the navigation is

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone see any compatibility problems with this? Should the HTML5

</I>&gt;<i> that are invoked in rapid succession.&quot;
</I>
IE's behaviour seems the narrowest; would it be acceptable? Failing that, 
how about any navigations until the end of the load event task?

The proposal here would be to just assume a scripted navigation is done 
with replacement enabled in the condition described above, right?
