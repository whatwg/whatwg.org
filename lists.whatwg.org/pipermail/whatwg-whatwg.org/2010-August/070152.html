I followed your references but I couldn't figure out which example you
meant. What exactly do you think we should add?

The a,b,c,... notation is at least as common as m11,m12,....

Yes.

It appears at least .NET uses the same notation and order.

Could you describe what interpretations of the current text would be valid
but would not be compatible with the bulk of existing implementations? I'm
not sure how to fix this exactly. (Graphics is not my area of expertise,
unfortunately. I'm happy to apply any proposed text though!)

I'm pretty sure it's too late to change this.

Actually the spec was based off the WebKit implementation, but this
particular part had no documentation describing what it did, so I
couldn't specify it. :-(

I'm happy to change the spec, so long as what the spec says is
well-defined.

Change it what, exactly?


&gt;<i> #2) Change the globalCompositingOperation spec from referencing PORTER-DUFF

What problem would this solve?

&gt;<i> source-over

I tried searching the OpenGL specification for either glBlendFunc or
GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA and couldn't find either. Could you be more
specific regarding what exactly we would be referencing?  I'm not really
sure I understand you proposal.

I've tried to clarify this.


&gt;<i> Also, descriptions of the operators cover only transparent and opaque

I've tried to make this less oblique.

The solution to that will be CORS, in due course, if the remote site has
opted-in to allowing it, or &lt;input type=file&gt;, if the user is to provide
any random URL.

</I>&gt;<i> It says that subsequent calls ignore the attributes. There is a

That seems reasonable.

I've made getContext() have an open-ended list of additional arguments,
and let contexts say what happens to them the first time. When the method
is called a second time, these arguments are ignored.

'2d' ignores the arguments.

I believe Boris answered this sufficiently. Let me know if there's

&gt;<i> As far as I know, there is no way to do this using the HTML5 spec.

Correct. You have to use the SVG and CSS specs. :-)


&gt;<i> Rationale: One of the greatest benefits I see in SVG is the way it can

</I>
Note that you really shouldn't be putting layout in the HTML file, even if
it's using SVG. The HTML file should be media-independent as much as
possible.

Well, there's also the way it doesn't interact with the OS text selection, 
copy-and-paste, drag-and-drop, accessibility APIs, the browsers' undo

&quot;Search in Spotlight&quot;, and the i18n features like bidi handling. And 
that's just for starters. :-)

The 2D API isn't complete by a long shot, there's no difficulty in proving 
that. It's not trying to be complete.
