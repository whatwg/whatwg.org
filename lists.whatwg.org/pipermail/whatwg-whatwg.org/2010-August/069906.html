&gt;<i> What strikes me though is that according to the spec &quot;The br element represents a line break&quot;. A *line* break is presentational in nature. The break is structural, but restricting it to a certain presentation of that break lacks the desired separation of structure and presentation.

I agree. Other elements have been redefined to remove medium-specific descriptions from their definitions (&lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, and &lt;hr&gt;, specifically). It seems logical to me that &lt;br&gt; should get the same treatment.

The suggestion, as far as I understand it, is not to change how the element *works* in browsers, but merely to redefine its meaning as &quot;a minor logical break&quot; rather than &quot;a line break.&quot; The default browser styling would not change.

This is no longer true. The semantics of &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; have been changed in HTML5, specifically to separate the presentation from the meaning. Specifically, any reference to screen- or page-specific styling like &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;italic&quot; have been removed (allowing the elements to still have meaning in a medium such as audio).

I like Thomas's suggestion (or, at least, I like it as much as any of the semantic redefinitions being applied to formerly-presentational elements).

The &lt;hr&gt; element is currently defined as &quot;a paragraph-level thematic break.&quot; I think &lt;br&gt; could be defined as &quot;a text-level thematic break.&quot;
