</I>&gt;<i> Basically, most of the issues with headings boil down to a single fact:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And now, in HTML5, not only have &lt;h1-6&gt; been kept, but a plethora of new 
</I>&gt;<i> elements: &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;hgroup&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;footer&gt;; and it even messes with &lt;address&gt;. The justifications for 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h1-6&gt; (backwards compatibility, better transition, etc) are quite 
</I>&gt;<i> sound; but the 7 new elements more than double the mess.
</I>
Another way to look at it is that the new elements simplify the markup 
authors have to use. Most of the new elements correspond to very commonly 
used class names.


&gt;<i> Actually, if we try to &quot;implement&quot; the outlining algorithm in the form 
</I>&gt;<i> of selectors that match each level of headings we have: On the case that 
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;h1&gt;-only approach, selecting each level of heading requires a list 
</I>&gt;<i> of something raised to the n-th power selectors, where n is the heading 
</I>&gt;<i> level minus one.
</I>
Not necessarily. We can fix Selectors to make this much shorter, in a way 
equivalent to what the spec says, for example using a pseudo-class like 
Mozilla's :-moz-any().


&gt;<i> On the case of a mixed approach, it is *absolutely* impossible to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the headings properly matched with current selector technology.
</I>
Indeed. We can always improve that technology if that's a problem, though.

In practice it's not clear what the needs are here. I don't see most 
authors needing to select both &lt;section&gt;/&lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt;/&lt;h3&gt; etc with the 
styles interacting. Do you have any concrete use cases in mind where this 
is a problem?


&gt;<i> My suggestion is to clean things a bit: consolidate the sectioning model 
</I>&gt;<i> into a single element+attribute pair, like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt; stays as is.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;nav&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;aside&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;address&quot;&gt; (and the former is defined
</I>&gt;<i> in the compatibility section as equivalent to the later, because it is
</I>&gt;<i> the only element of the sectioning model that already exists in
</I>&gt;<i> previous versions of HTML).
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure about what should be done with &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt;, but I hope this is a good place to discuss it ;-)
</I>
I don't understand what problem this solves. All its seems to do is make 
the language more verbose.


&gt;<i> This yields several advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The styling issue improves drastically: any pre-HTML5 will
</I>&gt;<i> understand this (IE would require a bit of javascript anyway) out of
</I>&gt;<i> the box:
</I>&gt;<i> h1 { styling for top-level }
</I>&gt;<i> section h1 { styling for second-level }
</I>&gt;<i> section section h1 { styling for third-level }
</I>&gt;<i> and so on, for as many levels as you need.
</I>
If you want to target older UAs, you can just use &lt;h2&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; with 
&lt;section&gt;, instead of relying on the automatic sizing of &lt;h1&gt;.


&gt;<i> 2) All of a sudden, something like &lt;section kind=&quot;aside nav&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;See
</I>&gt;<i> also&lt;/h1&gt; some indirectly related links here...&lt;/section&gt; becomes
</I>&gt;<i> possible, plus easy to style, and works happily with the outlining
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm.
</I>
Isn't that a negative, rather than a positive?


&gt;<i> 3) Future needs will become easier to solve on future versions of the 
</I>&gt;<i> specification, and with significantly smaller costs: for example, let's 
</I>&gt;<i> assume a new sectioning element such as &lt;attachment&gt; becomes a 
</I>&gt;<i> widespread need (it would already make sense on sites like web-mail 
</I>&gt;<i> services, discussion boards, bug-trackers, and some others...). So a new 
</I>&gt;<i> crouton on the soup, which would be treated quite like a generic &lt;div&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> by pre-HTML6 (or 7, or whatever) browsers. Now, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;+attribute approach, we'd get something like &lt;section 
</I>&gt;<i> kind=&quot;attachment&quot;&gt;: that'd would still work with the outlining algoryth 
</I>&gt;<i> (it could be treated as generic section), it's styling will work 
</I>&gt;<i> smoothly, etc.
</I>
Given how often we add new sectioning elements, I don't think that's 
something to worry about optimising for. At least not in favour of a 
simple language.

</I>&gt;<i> It's not a matter of saving a few characters here and there.
</I>
Well, that was more or less the reasoning behind having these elements in 
the first place, so it is a _bit_ about that. :-)


&gt;<i> The very purpose of &lt;section&gt; and its friends is to implement explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> sectioning on HTML, so there is no need to rely on error-prone, 
</I>&gt;<i> painful-to-maintain implicit &lt;h1-6&gt;-based sectioning. However, the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> recommends still using &lt;h1-6&gt; anyway, to ensure backwards compatibility. 
</I>&gt;<i> The compatibility goal itself is a quite good thing but, on this case, 
</I>&gt;<i> it not only destroys the primary purpose of the feature, but makes 
</I>&gt;<i> things even worse: having to state the same thing (the sectioning of the 
</I>&gt;<i> document) twice (with the sectioning elements and with the numbered 
</I>&gt;<i> headings) doubles the chance to introduce errors, and doubles the effort 
</I>&gt;<i> required to maintain the content.
</I>
Yeah, but it's only an issue during the transition period.


&gt;<i> In summary: the &lt;section&gt;+attribute approach solves all the issues the
</I>&gt;<i> current model solves
</I>
Not all of them; the main problem was that using &lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt; made ugly 
documents that are a mess to maintain.


&gt;<i> provides better (backward and forward) compatibility
</I>
It provides no better backwards compatibility unless you are relying on 
CSS, and the forward-compatibility in this case is of minimal concern 
given the timescales we're talking about here.


&gt;<i> allows better leveraging existing technologies (such as CSS) to work 
</I>&gt;<i> with it
</I>
Is that a goal? It seems that we should improve the platform as a whole, 
not design features in HTML based on CSS' current limitations.


&gt;<i> would be simpler to specify and to implement
</I>
It wouldn't be simpler to specify, since the status quo is already 
specified, so would require no work. :-)

The implementation burden also seems minimal in either case.


&gt;<i> and easier for authors to learn
</I>
That I'm not convinced of at all.


&gt;<i> and solves some use cases the current model does not.
</I>
It's not clear that those use cases are real problems, though.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of

That doesn't follow. It just means both either be appropriate.


&gt;<i> The most blatant example
</I>&gt;<i> (which I thought was clear enough from the example) are &quot;See also&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> sections found on many sites (see a couple of examples on [1] and
</I>&gt;<i> [2]). Currently, the closest thing we may get is
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;nav&gt;&lt;aside&gt;...&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; or &lt;aside&gt;&lt;nav&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;.
</I>
Just &lt;aside&gt;...&lt;/aside&gt; or &lt;nav&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt; works too.


&gt;<i> This raises several concerns: which one should be the outer, and which 
</I>&gt;<i> the inner section? How would that interact with the sectioning 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm? (ie: would a heading inside there be taken as one level lower 
</I>&gt;<i> than the expected one?).
</I>
I think you may be overthinking this. :-)
