<PRE>Yes, for IndexDB I think having a per-storage area expiration date completely makes sense. Do you expect that IndexedDB will become a successor to sessionStorage/localStorage? My belief is that the simple key-value store paradigm would still end up being the default client-side data storage utility, and would therefore benefit from having a per-key expiration time to mimic cookie usage.

To be clear, I think there should be expiration for all forms of client-side data storage, and adding it to one doesn't seem like a reason to not add it to all.

If we add this to IndexedDB then there are certainly multiple storage
areas. You can have any number of objectStores inside any number of
databases.

&gt;<i> Having every developer that wants to expire data write his or her own code seems extremely wasteful to me. Why ask people to reinvent the same functionality over and over again? Whether or not cookies are a good model to follow, the expiration functionality is what makes auth sequences using them feasible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd defer to those who know on implementation details, but this doesn't seem like a very hard problem to solve in a performant way.
</I>
If we add expiration to IndexedDB on an objectStore level, then the
page author doesn't need to do anything beyond setting an expiration
date, right?
