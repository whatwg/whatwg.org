I'm reluctant to add new features right now to this API, since there's so 
much other stuff for browser vendors to implement and bug fix, but 
expiring data is something that's been on the list of &quot;v2&quot; features for 
Web Storage for some time, so I'm sure we'll add it eventually.

That is indeed a good route to follow.

It would also be good to document the reasons why people want to expire 
data. It's presumably not security -- you'd want to expire the authority 
of any credentials on the server side long before it became an issue to 
have them stored on the client side. It's presumably also not just wanting 
to clean things up -- browsers are going to have to deal with expiring old 
storage data that the user hasn't used anyway, whether we let the site 
clean up after themselves or not.
