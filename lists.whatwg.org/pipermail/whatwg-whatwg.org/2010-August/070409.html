</I>&gt;<i> full of crap, but they are both pretty effective at getting the message
</I>&gt;<i> across.
</I>


Yeah, I'm totally for adding a hint as to what format is in the cue. Then, a
WebSRT file can be identified as to what it contains.



&gt;<i>   If we define WebSRT in a way that can handle &gt;99% of existing content and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> degrade gracefully (enough) when using new features in old software, it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems reasonable to do. If lots of software developers cry foul, then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps we should reconsider. It seems to me, though, that actually
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> researching and defining a good algorithm for parsing SRT would be of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> others than just browsers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  How is that different from moving away from SRT. If everyone has to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> change
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their parsing of SRT to accommodate a new spec, then that is a new
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> format.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not everyone has to change their parsers immediately, many will continue
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work. However, if someone wants to support SRT in a compatible way, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very helpful to have a spec, assuming that WebSRT is actually compatible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enough with existing SRT content.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is quite similar to HTML4 vs HTML5. There are lots of mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compatible HTML parsers, but HTML5 defines a single parsing algorithm,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> slow convergence towards that is a good thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, no, no! It is not at all similar to HTML4 and HTML5. A Web browser
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot suddenly stop working for a Web page, just because it has some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality in it. Thus, the HTML format has been developed such that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be extended without breaking existing stuff. We can guarantee that no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser will break because that is the way in which the format has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No such thing has happened for SRT and there is simply no way to guarantee
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that all new WebSRT files will work in all existing SRT software, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SRT has not been specified as a extensible format and because there is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreement between all parties that have implemented SRT support as to how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extensions should be made.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can introduce such a thing for WebSRT, but we cannot claim it for SRT.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right, existing SRT parsers are probably far less interoperable
</I>&gt;<i> than HTML parsers were before HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Existing content demands that SRT parsers handle at least &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;font&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> and &lt;u&gt; in some manner, even if it is by ignoring it. Any parsers that treat
</I>&gt;<i> SRT as plain text don't even work with todays content, so I don't think they
</I>&gt;<i> should be considered at all.
</I>

You've just defined what SRT is. I would actually define SRT as the plain
text format and the &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;font&gt; and &lt;u&gt; markup as extensions.



&gt;<i> The question, then, is if parsers that handle the mentioned markup also
</I>&gt;<i> ignore &lt;1&gt;, &lt;ruby&gt; and &lt;rt&gt;. I haven't tested it, but I assume that some
</I>&gt;<i> will ignore it and some won't. How many percent of the media player market
</I>&gt;<i> would have to handle this correctly for these extensions to be OK, in your
</I>&gt;<i> opinion?
</I>

If a single one breaks, it would be bad IMO because the expectations of the
users of that software will be broken even if it may just be a small
percentage of users and we have no influence on the upgrade path of that
software - in particular if it is proprietary.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If the SRT ecosystem is so fragile that it cannot tolerate any extension
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whatsoever, then we should stay far away from it. It just seems that's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the case.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How do we know that everyone that uses SRT now really wants to use WebSRT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead and wants to take part in the new ecosystem that we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> introducing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We make some pretty big assumptions about what everyone who is not a Web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser vendor wants to do with SRT. That doesn't make the existing SRT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ecosystem fragile - but it makes it an existing environment that needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, what is your recommendation? The following ideas have been
</I>&gt;<i> on the table:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Change the file extension to something other than .srt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have an opinion, browsers ignore the file extension anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I think we should definitely have a new file extension.



&gt;<i> * Change the MIME type to something other than text/srt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt it makes any difference, as most software that deal with SRT today
</I>&gt;<i> have no concept of MIME types. No matter what I'd want exactly 1 MIME type
</I>&gt;<i> or alternatively make browsers ignore the MIME type completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're right in that existing SRT software probably doesn't deal much with a
SRT mime type. Right now text/x-srt or text/srt is sometimes used for SRT
files, but often text/plain is also in use and more likely from a Web
server. Since this is the space where Web browsers play, I am not overly
fussed, though I think logically text/websrt makes more sense with a .wsrt
extension. Then, also SRT files can be served as text/websrt to allow them
to take part in the WebSRT infrastructure if indeed they will continue to be
valid WebSRT files.

Incidentally, it is a problem if WebSRT files are served as text/plain, i.e.
will the browser not identify them as subtitle files?



&gt;<i> * Add a header to WebSRT to make it uniquely identifiable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The header would have to be mandatory and browsers would have to reject
</I>&gt;<i> files that don't have it. Such files would be compatible with some existing
</I>&gt;<i> software and break some, depending on how they sniff. We could also put
</I>&gt;<i> metadata in such a header.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I think we need to introduce a header. Maybe we can hide all the
structure in what SRT recognizes as comments (i.e. start the lines as &quot;;&quot;.
But I believe we need some hints like the @profile to identify the type of
the cues and the &lt;link&gt; to link to a style sheet, and we need metadata like
the &lt;meta&gt; element of HTML headers.


* Make something deliberately incompatible with SRT.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't make a big difference to browsers implementing the format. We'd
</I>&gt;<i> be replacing something that mostly works in existing players with something
</I>&gt;<i> that never works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That was the idea of WMML and I took that path because I thought it would be
advantageous for other Web applications, such as built on libxml2, expat,
php's SimpleXML, pyexpat for python, Nokogiri for ruby etc. But I really
like the idea of WebSRT to allow arbitrary metadata in the cues without
having to put it into CDATA sections.

I don't mind creating a format that is still somewhat compatible with SRT.
We don't have to force incompatibility - but we should also not have it
restrict us. In either case, it is a new format.



&gt;<i> Here's the SRT research I promised:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.foolip.org/2010/08/20/srt-research/">http://blog.foolip.org/2010/08/20/srt-research/</A>
</I>

That is awesome work. I knew that most SRT files didn't use UTF-8, but I
didn't know that we would make such a large percentage of files that are
currently parsed by SRT software be incompatible. It is good data to have.

Cheers,
Silvia.
