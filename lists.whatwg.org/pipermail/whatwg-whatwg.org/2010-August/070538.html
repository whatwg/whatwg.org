To be honest, no you can't.  Not with such large labels, at least.
You'll never be able to say &quot;X browser supports CSS3&quot;, but CSS3 isn't
a thing.  You can name individual modules only, which is equivalent to
naming large features of HTML.


&gt;<i> That is, as long as I'm using the current browser, I know I've got support for whatever is latest. &#160;But, when I'm providing support for folks using non-current browsers, there's some value in being able to estimate what will and won't work there. Saying &quot;well, I have no idea if our app will work in the browser you have, because no one knows what form of the HTML spec it supported&quot; doesn't go over very well with someone paying you money :-).
</I>
Your ability to tell what was supported by an old browser isn't
hampered at all by this.  No matter what, someone has to document what
that browser did.


&gt;<i> Maybe it would make more sense to version the test suite in some fashion? &#160;Then one could say: &quot;SurfBrowser 7.8 passes the HTML test suite of March 15th, 2012&quot; and so as long as folks know what that test suite is validating, then this might address support issues just fine.
</I>
Potentially useful, but it seems just as useful to talk about which
features it passes the tests for.
