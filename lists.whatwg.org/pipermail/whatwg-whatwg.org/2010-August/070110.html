</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm more inclined to believe that option (2) is the better option.

What problem would this solve? User agents fetch anything specified in an 
&lt;iframe&gt;; are you proposing we change that?


&gt;<i> It should not be assumed that whatever resource included via &lt;iframe&gt; is

</I>&gt;<i> it could be helpful for the author to give the user agent a hint as to

</I>&gt;<i> the user agent to choose not to display the contents of the &lt;iframe&gt; if 
</I>&gt;<i> it feels it cannot support it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The particular use case that prompted me to think about this is 
</I>&gt;<i> including a PDF via &lt;iframe&gt;. In Firefox (last I checked), one is 
</I>&gt;<i> required to install a separate add-on in order to support in-browser 
</I>&gt;<i> display of PDF files on Mac OS X, since there is no native or integrated 
</I>&gt;<i> Adobe Reader support available. Without the add-on, the user will be 
</I>&gt;<i> prompted to download the PDF file, which can be very disconcerting if 
</I>&gt;<i> the user wasn't even expecting a PDF file. And I'm sure there are plenty 
</I>&gt;<i> of other instances where this same situation occurs. (TIFF files, 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps? Like on the U.S. Patent Office's website?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I'm not a spec implementor by any means, but I am a web author and 
</I>&gt;<i> a web user, so I've been on both sides of this issue. And it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> appear that it would be too complicated to extend the existing support 
</I>&gt;<i> of @type.
</I>
Surely a better solution is to make files that would be downloaded simply 
display an inline prompt (rather than a pop-up prompt) in this case.

It seems that if browsers wanted to do that, they could do it today using 
the information from the Content-Type header. The type=&quot;&quot; attribute would 
only allow them to do it slightly quicker, and slightly less accurately.

For &lt;video&gt;, where it makes sense, we already have it.


In any case, I recommend following this suggestion from the FAQ for new 
features such as this:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F</A>
