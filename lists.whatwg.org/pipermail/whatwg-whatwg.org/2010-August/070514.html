Ok, I've changed popstate to get fired (or queued up, if before 'load') 
for every traversal, not just those to non-null states.

Indeed.


&gt;<i> &gt; However, it seems like the (web) developer's mental model for popstate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be much simpler if it fired whenever the current session history

Ok.


BTW, there's another problem with this API, which is that since popstates 
are dropped while the document is loading, calling pushState() while the 
document is loading leads to a very confused state. Should we make 
pushState() throw an exception if called before load? (replaceState() is 
probably ok, though even that's a bit dodgy.)

I assume we don't want to change this, in which case I should probably put 
a note in the spec warning about using pushState() and replaceState() 
before load. Any opinions on this?
