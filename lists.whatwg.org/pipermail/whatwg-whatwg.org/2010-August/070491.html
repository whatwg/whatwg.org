I'm slightly confused how that works.  How do you represent arbitrary
binary data as characters?  Another option is to provide a base64
encoder/decoder that uses UTF8 to encode/decode the binary.

It's always necessary to consider compatibility.  Perhaps one of our
friends with the ability to grep the web would be kind enough to tell
us how common &amp;% followed by base64 characters followed by ; is.

Which way is that?

</I>
Escaping just those character is insufficient.  The appeal of this
approach is that authors don't need the right blacklist of dangerous
characters.  By the way, there are already folks doing something
similar manually now.  They send the untrusted bytes as base64 and
decode them using JavaScript.

</I>
Because &lt;script&gt; does not decode entities in HTML, the attacker will
be limited to what he or she can do with alphanumeric characters, +,
/, and trailing =.  Of course, if the entity appears in a string
context (as is pretty common), the attacker won't be able to break out
of the string context, even by include &lt;/script&gt; in the attack string
(which is a common vulnerability in hand-rolled escaping schemes).

Yes.  That's precisely what happens.

Kind regards,
