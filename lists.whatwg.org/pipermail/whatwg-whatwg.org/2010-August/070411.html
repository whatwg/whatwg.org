<PRE>  Thanks for the history lesson :)  I'm not underestimating 
backwards-compatibility, but since so much of old web content is brittle 
in so many ways, it's hard to know in advance exactly which problems are 
hiding under that back-compat umbrella.

One more question: Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you mean by &quot;throw 
the document away&quot;, but if it means the document gets discarded, garbage 
collected, and the DOM for that page doesn't exist any more... if you 
had a page that mutated a hibernated document with a *single* DOM call, 
then no exception would be thrown but the page would vanish and perhaps 
eventually reload.  But if the page mutated a hibernated document with 
*two* DOM calls, wouldn't the second one fail anyway, because the 
document was thrown away?  So we trade one exception for another...

</I>Hmm, that is tricky, and a timing bug indeed.  That points out another 
potential question -- if the user navigates away from a page with an 
active XHR/JPEG-push/whatever connection, will Gecko then force that 
page to stay alive, and continue running script? -- but that leads us 
farther away from the original question of this thread, regarding 
detaching and reattaching iframes with documents.  My only two cents 
here are that it seems like these scenarios (abrupt iframe detachment, 
abrupt history navigation, where abrupt means &quot;while event handlers 
might be queued or network activity might still be running&quot;) are almost 
but currently not quite behaviorally equivalent to ones with bursty or 
slow network connections; maybe that gives us some wiggle room to 
simplify the spec and/or implementations.  But like others on this 
thread, I've gone as far as I understand; I defer to the experts what 
the correct behavior here ought to be.
