Actually, I'd be fine with typing a whole YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD 
date/time into an ordinary text input field.

But as it seems HTML will have date and time input fields. Taking this 
into account I'd be confused to experience different behavior for 
different date fields in the same form, i.e. sometimes being able to use 
a calendar tool and sometimes not being able to use it.

(Just as Andrew Hayward stated: 
<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-August/028097.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-August/028097.html</A>)

...

I'd also be interested in browser developers' opinion on this? Are you 
likely to implement a date selection tool in the coming years? Or accept 
dates dropped from another application? I assume this becomes more and 
more useful with the growing importance of web applications.

My online banking account implements such a feature with JavaScript, so 
does my webmail account. But the tools are different, as they are made 
by different people and will be different again on the next website, 
although doing the same. Then my e-mail box autoresponder configuration 
uses &lt;select&gt;s to do the same as the JavaScript calendar tools mentioned 
above. Having all of these implemented by a common browser's date 
selection tool would make such standard input elements more accessible 
(and work with JavaScript turned off).
