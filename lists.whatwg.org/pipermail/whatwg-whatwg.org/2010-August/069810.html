</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a variety of ways this can be done today (e.g. the name=&quot;&quot;,

</I>&gt;<i> this? Surely they can do this now already, so why aren't they doing it?
</I>&gt;<i>

I suspect that this is usually a result of ignorance. I don't think
many content authors are aware of how form-fillers work.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It didn't seem to do much to make adoption happen more quickly.

</I>&gt;<i> Why would this new idea make things go faster?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;has been implemented for a long time&quot;.
I am not aware of any ecommerce site of any significant size
implementing this standard. Having been responsible for one such site
from roughly 2002-2008, I had never heard of this spec, nor have
several people that I would expect to have heard of it if it had ever
achieved any traction at all. This makes me suspect that this is not a
great example to hold up.

I think it is pretty well known that simply getting a document
published and declaring it a standard is not sufficient to ensuring
adoption, but not having a document published is certainly a deterrent
to adoption.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Saying &quot;why bother?&quot; about all the broken sites on the web totally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defeats the purpose of what everyone here's trying to achieve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but we can't help these sites without their cooperation. How do we
</I>&gt;<i> get them to cooperate? We've tried standards (RFC3106), we've tried making
</I>&gt;<i> the user experience better (password fillers). What else can we try?
</I>&gt;<i> Another &lt;input&gt; doesn't seem to address this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In the absence of any recommended convention that people are actually
aware of, sites will continue to make life difficult for password
managers and form-fillers. Encouraging people to follow a convention
would be a good thing, even if we have a large legacy problem that
would have to be addressed through other things.

Suggesting that people follow 3106 instead of creating a new input
type (which is I think what you're doing) is certainly one possible
solution here.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this idea is halfway to what I'd want to see. Namely, we should

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the whole login process needs to be taken as out of page as

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login from an in-page element (hence the above).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly urge people to experiment in this area. This is the kind of

</I>
Agreed; I think there is a lot of value in having a conversation about
how we might improve login flows on this list, but it is too early to
think that we can standardize on one particular implementation.
Perhaps the WHATWG needs an experimental track in addition to a
standards track?
