Done.

Getting authors to be disciplined about defining main content is in fact 
the same as being disciplined about &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, etc, 
because the main content is anything not in those elements.

</I>
We could either mark up what's the main content, implying that everything 
else is not the main content, or mark up what's not the main content, 
implying that everything else is the main content. We've gone with the 
latter, because it turns out that the main content's presentation is 
usually just the default, whereas everything else needs to be styled 
specially, so people usually want to wrap the non-main-content.

However, there are cases where you also want to wrap the main content. For 
those cases, we have &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;div&gt; (in increasing order 
of vagueness).

Actually it's pretty much what &lt;article&gt; was meant for.

I don't understand why.

Think of a sentence:

   I like kittens (and cats).

The important content is &quot;I like kittens&quot;. The less important content is 
&quot;and cats&quot;. We mark up the less important content.

I don't see why the &quot;define main content&quot; step is useful. What problem 
does it solve?

</I>
This seems to be a solved problem today, without any markup.

We just add them to the list of elements that go in head, and wait a few 
years.
