OK, fair enough.

&gt;&gt;<i> (It's difficult for Opera to rely on the message loop to resume the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synchronous section, because our script engine can suspend and continue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executing on a later message. Therefore, waiting for a script to finish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executing is the best solution.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See, this concept of &quot;a script&quot; is a funny one, given that scripts are  
</I>&gt;<i> reentrant, and that multiple different scripts can all be running at the  
</I>&gt;<i> same time, possibly with event loops nested in between on the conceptual  
</I>&gt;<i> callstack
</I>
Well, what we really look at is an execution thread. When a script  
triggers a synchronous event handler or is otherwise suspended while  
waiting for another thread to finish, we will wait for the &quot;outermost&quot;  
suspended thread to finish executing. So, yeah, it's not completely  
trivial :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If it doesn't, just don't ever continue with the synchronous section.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think that's reasonable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A script that's stuck in an infinite loop is broken
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who said anything about infinite loops?
</I>
It's one way of a script not finishing.

&gt;&gt;<i> If a script is showing a modal dialog, not loading a video in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background seems fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why?  It doesn't seem fine to me at all.
</I>
My point is that no one uses modal dialogues, so what happens doesn't  
really matter as long as it is consistent. Let's do what makes the most  
sense implementation-wise and spec-wise and let the result be whatever it  
turns out to be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would block all event handlers from running too
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I believe this is false in the case of showModalDialog.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It sounds like we're going to end up with slightly incompatible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, neither one of us is implementing what the spec calls for (in  
</I>&gt;<i> different ways), so... ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A far more important issue is still what to do while the parser is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running and we should &quot;await a stable state&quot;. It can't possibly mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waiting until the parser has completely finished running
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, no.  However I would assume that a &quot;stable state&quot; in that  
</I>&gt;<i> situation would, for example, imply that the DOM is in a self-consistent  
</I>&gt;<i> state.  So if you start the load algorithm when a &lt;video&gt; is inserted in  
</I>&gt;<i> the document, it has to be after the insertion is fully processed or  
</I>&gt;<i> some such...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, what Gecko would likely do here is to treat &quot;stable state&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;the event loop is spinning&quot;, just like we would for the other case.  
</I>&gt;<i>   This means that while a modal dialog is up, or a sync XHR is running  
</I>&gt;<i> or whatnot is a stable state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it just means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> letting the parser finish its current batch of input
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would assume it does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't see how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> black-box testing could tell the difference between this and always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignoring the &quot;await a stable state&quot; step
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible that it can't.  It would depend on the exact steps that  
</I>&gt;<i> run in the synchronous section, but since synchronous sections can't  
</I>&gt;<i> trigger script it might not be detectable at all.
</I>
The most important things is that the following always alert 3  
(NETWORK_NO_SOURCE):

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;video&gt;
&lt;source&gt;
&lt;script&gt;alert(document.querySelector('video').networkState)&lt;/script&gt;

In other words, the synchronous section must at the latest be run just  
before running an inline script.
