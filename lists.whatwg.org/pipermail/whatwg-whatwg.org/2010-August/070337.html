Right.

That's sorta-ok if your video is a subframe that you treat as a black box.
But if your video element is just an element in your page with event
handlers attached to it, and with various scripts that interact with it, and
you rip that element out (plus maybe some supporting elements representing
your player UI) and drop it in another document, it seems to me you're going
to have to code very carefully to ensure it keeps working over there (and
the original page doesn't get into a bad state). If there's confirmation UI
so that the movement between documents happens asynchronously, it's even
more exciting. Moving the element back when the user exits fullscreen has
similar issues.

Maybe there are ways to make that model easy and convenient for authors. I'd
like to see a proposal.
