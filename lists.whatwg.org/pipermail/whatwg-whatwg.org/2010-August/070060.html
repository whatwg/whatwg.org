</I>&gt;<i> The 22 June 2010 spec says in section 6.5.1 Navigating across documents:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the source browsing context is not the same as the browsing context 
</I>&gt;<i> being navigated, ..., and the source browsing context had its sandboxed 
</I>&gt;<i> navigation browsing context flag set when its active document was 
</I>&gt;<i> created, then abort these steps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When exactly is its active document created?
</I>
For HTML documents, it happens as part of the navigation algorithm, when 
it parses the HTML file (first sentence):

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#read-html">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#read-html</A>


&gt;<i> I can read this clause in several ways:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * When documents are created they must set the sandboxed navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context flag on their browsing context.  But documents are 
</I>&gt;<i> created before they are active in some browsing context, so that seems 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * When documents are set as active within a browsing context.  But that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't sound like &quot;creation&quot; time, so that seems wrong too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * At the instant the document was allocated, the browsing context 
</I>&gt;<i> happened to record its current context flags despite the document not 
</I>&gt;<i> being active in the browsing context yet.  But that seems implausible at 
</I>&gt;<i> best.
</I>
It's the latter, at least as specced. Why is it implausible?


&gt;<i> Additionally, the sandboxing flags seem to be more a feature of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;iframe&gt; element than of the browsing context, because they depend on 
</I>&gt;<i> the value of the &lt;iframe&gt;'s sandbox attribute.  Can these flags ever be 
</I>&gt;<i> set on a top-level browsing context?  No, correct?
</I>
Currently, yes, but there's no reason for that to remain the case.


&gt;<i> The spec then talks about the seamless browsing context flag.  Is this 
</I>&gt;<i> flag distinct from the sandbox-seamless-iframes flag?  And when is this 
</I>&gt;<i> flag set?
</I>
Yes, the two are distinct. It is set automatically when the iframe has the 
seamless attribute set, as per the &lt;iframe&gt; section.


&gt;<i> It seems different from the others, because it can be set by 
</I>&gt;<i> manipulating content attributes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, when the attribute is set on an iframe element whose owner 
</I>&gt;<i> Document's browsing context did not have the sandboxed seamless iframes 
</I>&gt;<i> flag set when that Document was created, and while either the browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> context's active document has the same origin as the iframe element's 
</I>&gt;<i> document, or the browsing context's active document's address has the 
</I>&gt;<i> same origin as the iframe element's document, the following requirements 
</I>&gt;<i> apply:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 The user agent must set the seamless browsing context 
</I>&gt;<i> flag to true for that browsing context. This will cause links to open in 
</I>&gt;<i> the parent browsing context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WARNING! It is important that user agents recheck the above conditions 
</I>&gt;<i> whenever the active document of the nested browsing context of the 
</I>&gt;<i> iframe changes, such that the seamless browsing context flag gets unset 
</I>&gt;<i> if the nested browsing context is navigated to another origin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again the question of &quot;when the document was created&quot;.  Additionally, 
</I>&gt;<i> the seamless flag refers to the iframe, the iframe's owner document, the 
</I>&gt;<i> iframe's owner document's browsing context, and the iframe's browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> context itself.  These don't seem intrinsically like flags on the 
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context...
</I>
Well they're only set on browsing contexts that are inside iframes, and 
there's a 1:1 mapping of &lt;iframe&gt; to browsing context, so you could look 
at it either way. I just did it in terms of the browsing context since 
that's more flexible and doesn't require us to keep checking for an 
iframe.


&gt;<i> Are there any other flags that might apply to browsing contexts that 
</I>&gt;<i> might equally well apply to iframes instead?
</I>
I can't think of any off-hand.

This is the case in the spec also.


&gt;<i> 2) If the Document object is associated with a Frame, then we check

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If so, we copy the sandbox bits from the &lt;iframe&gt; element into the

This seems conformant.
