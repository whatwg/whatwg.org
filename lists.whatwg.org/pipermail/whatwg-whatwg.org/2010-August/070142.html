It would have been more helpful to explain, if you can, the cause of
the slowness in Firefox..


I can run the debugger and step through it to see which part is taking
time and then explain that. There is a slight chance that I'll
actually do that, depending on time.

&gt;&gt;<i> Looping through the dom on page load is something that is best avoided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not an issue here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No. Actually it *is* an issue here; that issue is just massively
dwarfed by the other issue behind door #2.

&gt;&gt;<i> Most (if not all) of this stuff seems best suite for server-side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's possible; I'm assuming Ian had a reason for setting it up the way

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Possible where? On w3c server or whatwg server?
