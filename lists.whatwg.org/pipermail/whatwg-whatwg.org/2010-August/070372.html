</I>
In the same cue? I'm not sure what you mean, but regardless I've hardly  
ever seen different styles for different speakers. I remember once  
watching a DVD using different color subtitles for different speakers and  
found it very annoying. The one case where it's actually useful (IMO) is  
duet karaokes, as in &lt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tOxfjHLK-A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tOxfjHLK-A</A>&gt;.  
Incidentally, since it's not possible to have multiple voices per cue,  
WebSRT doesn't actually support this (lines sung together should be a  
third color).

Personally, I'm mostly interested in it for the metadata so that one can  
produce transcripts or search by speaker, but numerical voices don't help  
a great deal here. In the current state of the spec, I wouldn't miss  
voices much if they were removed.

&gt;&gt;<i> Similarly, I think that the WebSRT parser should be designed to ignore  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things that it doesn't recognize,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree. Reusing the HTML fragment parsing algorithm would provide this

Yep, if we actually want to use an HTML parser.

&gt;<i> As for &lt;00:01:30&gt;, normal subtitles and, AFAIK, normal captions don't  
</I>&gt;<i> need time-based revelation of parts of the cue. (I'm not considering  
</I>&gt;<i> anime fansubbing &quot;normal&quot;; I mean TV, DVD and movie theater subtitles.  
</I>&gt;<i> Also, continuous revelation of live captioning isn't relevant to the  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;00:01:30&gt; feature.) Since the &lt;00:01:30&gt; isn't essential for making the  
</I>&gt;<i> feature set of HTML5 accessible, I think the &lt;00:01:30&gt; feature for  
</I>&gt;<i> karaoke and anime fansubbing should be considered for removal if it  
</I>&gt;<i> happens to have any undesirable properties--and not working without HTML  
</I>&gt;<i> parser modifications is such an undesirable property.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be OK with not supporting karaoke or anime fansubbing at all  
</I>&gt;<i> declaratively (requiring those use cases to be addressed in JavaScript)  
</I>&gt;<i> or with using more verbose syntax like &lt;t t=00:01:30&gt;...&lt;/t&gt;.
</I>
I'd also be fine with not having intra-cue timing, but adding new elements  
or attributes to HTML just for WebSRT seems odd.

I'm still unconvinced that using the HTML fragment parser is a good idea.  
Elsewhere in this thread I raised these concerns:

* Memory overhead by creating an HTML document per cue. This is just a  
hunch.

* Needing to load external resources before the cue is displayed, or have  
very different results depending on network speed and cache.

To address the last point we could make it invalid to use any other tags  
but &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;ruby&gt; and &lt;rt&gt; in the cues, but the benefit of using an  
HTML parser is then quite limited indeed.
