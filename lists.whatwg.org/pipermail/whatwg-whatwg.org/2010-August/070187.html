Apparently the spec doesn't win. :-(

Fixed.

I considered changing this, but I'm not convinced we should add 
loadedItems and totalItems to the progress events spec really. I spoke to 
the WebKit guys and they suggested not changing this, since there didn't 
seem to be much advantage to it and it would break back-compat.

What do you need this for?

Could you describe how you would use this information? What would you do 
differently based on this information?

I don't think there should be such a dialog, but if there is, the user 
agent can definitely also provide one to remove appcaches.

If this is something that people want, we can definitely add it in a 
future version. It'll be clear if people want it because some will fake it 
with returning 410s. If nobody does, then clearly they don't want it 
enough for it to be worth adding to the API. :-)

</I>
I suppose that's not unreasonable. I've added a similar section to the 
appcache section.


&gt;<i> The manifest file specifies the resources to cache, and the user agent 
</I>&gt;<i> caches each resource. There may be multiple application caches for a 
</I>&gt;<i> single domain. Be it through multiple Application Hosts, or multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> Application Groups (unique by their manifest URL, but not domain).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A user agent can do as it pleases, but the only real limit is the 
</I>&gt;<i> remaining space of the file system. If a resource cannot be cached 
</I>&gt;<i> because there is no more space left, there is no way around that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The likely behavior would be the user agent emits an &quot;error&quot; event. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, storage limits are not specified in the spec as an error 
</I>&gt;<i> condition: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html#event-appcache-error">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html#event-appcache-error</A>
</I>
In general the specification does not specify behaviour in handling 
constraints of the operating environment (e.g. out of memory, out of disk 
space). I've added some generic handling for this. We can add more 
detailed error reporting in a future version if there are good reasons to 
do this.

You can use any extension you like. I just listed .manifest because the 
registration template for the MIME type asked for one.

XML files are not as simple.

Yeah, that's pretty much the way it is.
