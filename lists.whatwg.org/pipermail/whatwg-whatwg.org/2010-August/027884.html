It's an interesting idea (the ability to ask for the browser to embed 
controls, that is; we wouldn't be able to grant cross-domain access to 
pages, since that would open all kinds of security problems). The best way 
to proceed is to follow the steps described in the wiki:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F</A>

In particular, I think getting implementation experience would be critical 
for such a feature. Do users get confused? Does just providing a set of UI 
controls actually address the use cases, or do authors still need more? 
That is the kind of questions we'd need answers to.
