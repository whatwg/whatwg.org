</I>&gt;<i> Is there any value in adding an &quot;href&quot; or &quot;uri&quot; or similar attribute to

</I>&gt;<i> about the work) or, in the case of a URI, an indicator that can be used 
</I>&gt;<i> as a reference programmatically?
</I>
I don't know; is there? What would the use case be?


&gt;<i> &lt;q&gt; has a &quot;cite&quot; attribute, so it seems to me that if we have a place to 
</I>&gt;<i> link to further information in &lt;q&gt; it makes sense to do so in &lt;cite&gt;.
</I>
To be honest, &lt;q cite&gt; hasn't been very successful. One could argue it is 
a failed experiment. :-) If it wasn't more or less harmless, I'd probably 
be arguing to remove it.


&gt;<i> If it were a URI (and therefore not necessarily retrievable), it would 
</I>&gt;<i> help in cases where the same work gets referenced in slightly different 
</I>&gt;<i> ways:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;As Ashley Crandall Amos says in &lt;cite

</I>&gt;<i> of Determining the Dates of Old English Literary Texts&lt;/cite&gt; ... Amos 
</I>&gt;<i> also mentions in &lt;cite 
</I>&gt;<i> uri=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/books/crandall/linguisticmeans">http://example.com/books/crandall/linguisticmeans</A>&quot;&gt;Linguistic 
</I>&gt;<i> Means&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Works tend to have as many different URIs to reference them as titles, 
sometimes more. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Using &lt;a&gt; does seem like it would solve this neatly without additional 
effort.

</I>
That's a good question; have people found this useful enough to work 
around the lack of an attribute here? If not, maybe there's no problem to 
solve in the first place.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Referencing something in the href attributed of an &lt;a&gt; tag implies

</I>
Any link could be resolved; for example the browser could have a handler 
for isbn: links that looks up the book on Amazon or Google Books.


&gt;<i> 2. We would have to formally define what &lt;a&gt; within &lt;cite&gt; means, 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise we would leave the pairing up for interpretation.
</I>
Until we know that this is a problem people really want solving, that's 
probably ok.


&gt;<i> 3. Are there instances where tags that can be used separately take on a 
</I>&gt;<i> different meaning in relation to one another?  I know what &lt;li&gt; means in 
</I>&gt;<i> relation to &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;, but then again, I can't really use &lt;li&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> outside of either of those two.
</I>
&lt;a&gt; wouldn't take on a different meaning, it would just add additional 
information to the page.

Indeed, that may be a better solution in general.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You stated that you want to &quot;indicate a location for a work (or 
</I>&gt;<i> information about the work)&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A hyperlink indicates the location of an item or information about an 
</I>&gt;<i> item, and &quot;a href&quot; creates a hyperlink.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What could be the other interpretations of &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;Work 
</I>&gt;<i> title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Work title&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; other than 
</I>&gt;<i> that the hyperlink locates the work or information about the work?
</I>
Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the combination of &quot;cite&quot; and &quot;a&quot; to indicate a work title and 
</I>&gt;<i> the location of the work or information about the work does not involve 
</I>&gt;<i> changing the meaning of either &quot;cite&quot; or &quot;a&quot;. This is the markup

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition</A>
</I>
Right.

Excellent!


&gt;<i> I'm in favor of adding a non-normative note to the section of the HTML5

</I>
Do you have a suggested example of how you've ended up using this? I 
prefer to use real-world examples where possible for this kind of thing.
