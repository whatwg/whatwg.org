<PRE>Hi there,

I&#8217;d like to contribute to the discussion on the &lt;time&gt; element with
some use cases

On Thu, Mar 19, 2009 at 10:35 AM, Ian Hickson &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ian at hixie.ch</A>&gt; wrote:

#1 Adding month or year (imprecise) dates to a calendar
I&#8217;m involved in organising events, and as part of this we make plans
for events with approximate times. Currently we use a shared calendar
plus have a list of events and approximate dates on a private website.
Rather than add a list of events to a web page plus add event data to
both a calendar, I&#8217;d like to list the events on a web page using
&lt;time&gt; and hCalendar or a microdata vocabulary, then add these events
to a calendar via a conversion tool. A workaround would be to use full
dates, but that gives a false indication of accuracy.

#2 Restyling dates
As others have already mentioned, in Japan it&#8217;s common to display
dates as 20-8-2010, 2010-8-20 and 2010&#24180;8&#26376;20&#26085;. In addition there&#8217;s this
fun alternative year system that&#8217;s still widely used, including in
official documents such as driver&#8217;s licenses, based on eras. Currently
it&#8217;s the 22nd year of the Heisei era; &#24179;22&#24180;8&#26376;20&#26085;. As in Hixie&#8217;s example
of allowing dates to be restyled to follow user conventions, it would
also be very useful to allow this for year and year-month dates, as
even Japanese people have difficulty converting between the two
systems, especially for anything before they were born. Allowing year
and year-month @datetime values would allow a browser to offer
localisation of date display including conversion between these two
date formats. For example:
&#160; &#160;&lt;time datetime=&quot;1935&quot;&gt;&#26157;9&#24180;&lt;/time&gt;
could be automatically restyled to
&#160; &#160;&lt;time datetime=&quot;1935&quot;&gt;1935&lt;/time&gt;
(that&#8217;s the ninth year of the Sh&#333;wa era btw ;)

Japanese credit cards frequently list only two digits for expiry year
(eg &#8220;10/15&#8221;), and some Japanese e-commerce sites use a 2-digit input
for year. Confusingly (well initially for me) these are always the
abbreviated 4-digit year not the era year. Having this information
semantically notated would make it more accessible.

#3 Encoding &lt;input&gt; unambiguously
If this is a use case, it would be nice to be able to encode all the
datetime-related states of the &lt;input&gt; element. It&#8217;s not currently
possible to use &lt;time&gt; for month and week input states. It would also
be nice to have a year state for &lt;input&gt;, as it has more use cases
than week, and it would allow combining with the month state for e.g.
credit card info.

Finally, I&#8217;m not sure how much of a use-case this makes but I&#8217;d like
to use &lt;time&gt; with microformats and microdata. Not allowing more time
formats (year, year-month, month-day&#8230;) restricts the use of &lt;time&gt; to
vocabularies with year-month-day specific dates.

If these primary use cases have changed please let me know. Hopefully
some of these use cases will be relevant for allowing at least year
and year-month formats for @datetime, as per ISO 8601.

Thanks for your time
