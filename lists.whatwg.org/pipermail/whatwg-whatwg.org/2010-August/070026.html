As Tab already pointed out, I quoted the error-recovery behavior. You were right that dl elements shouldn't be used without a dt element.

So, an address could be marked up like this:
&lt;address class=&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;
	&lt;dl class=&quot;adr&quot;&gt;
		&lt;dt class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;P. Sherman&lt;/dt&gt;
		&lt;dd class=&quot;street-address&quot;&gt;42 Wallaby Way&lt;/dd&gt;
		&lt;dd class=&quot;locality&quot;&gt;Sydney&lt;/dd&gt;
	&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;

Doing the same with explicit line breaks is awkward if you want to use microformats.

&lt;address class=&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;adr&quot;&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;P. Sherman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;street-address&quot;&gt;42 Wallaby Way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;locality&quot;&gt;Sydney&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;

But I'm sure somebody can explain to me why line breaks must be part of the address.

&gt;<i>No elements do.  Characters do, though.  Every period, comma,

</I>
Yes, even the space character breaks up a run of characters into words. My point is not that there are no other kinds of breaks. What I'm saying is that there's a somewhat stronger text-level break. Something that falls between character-type breaks and paragraph breaks. That something is used in poems and it can be used to split up an address. But in my opinion, that's definitely not a *line* break. Otherwise, a poem couldn't really be read aloud.

&gt;<i>So can omitting line breaks.  The address
</I>&gt;<i>123 Imaginary Place
</I>&gt;<i>New York, NY 12345
</I>&gt;<i>is not the same as
</I>&gt;<i>123 Imaginary Place New
</I>&gt;<i>York, NY 12345
</I>
Absolutely! But are these different addresses?
123 Imaginary Place       New York, NY 12345

123 Imaginary Place | New York, NY 12345

123 Imaginary Place * New York, NY 12345

Street number: 123
Street: Imaginary Place
City: New York
State: NY
Zip code: 12345

I would say no. Even though the first three don't contain a line break while the last one contains three additional line breaks. How can a *line* break then be part of the content?

Aryeh wrote:
&gt;<i>Indeed, the spec explicitly forbids using &lt;br&gt; where the line break is
</I>&gt;<i>presentational: &quot;br elements must be used only for line breaks that
</I>&gt;<i>are actually part of the content, as in poems or addresses.&quot;
</I>
Now you're quoting the part of the spec that I say is wrong to prove me wrong. That's not fair!
Just eliminate the word &quot;line&quot; in the spec and everything is fine.
