</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support both WebSRT and SRT. And I also have no issue with a user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deciding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to give a WebSRT file a go by renaming it to .srt.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By keeping WebSRT and SRT as different formats we give the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as all the extra features and all the extensibility of WebSRT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why wouldn't it always be a superior solution for all parties to do the  
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i>  1) Make sure WebSRT never requires processing that'd require rendering  
</I>&gt;<i> a substantial body of legacy .srt content in a broken way. (This would  
</I>&gt;<i> require supporting non-UTF-8 encodings by sniffing as well as supporting  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;font&gt; and &lt;u&gt;, which would happen &quot;for free&quot; if my innerHTML proposal  
</I>&gt;<i> were adopted.)
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Make playback software that supports WebSRT only have a WebSRT code  
</I>&gt;<i> path and use that code path for legacy .srt content as well.
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, if #1 is done, why would any pragmatic developer not want  
</I>&gt;<i> to do #2 if they are supporting WebSRT in their software? Why would  
</I>&gt;<i> anyone want to have a code path that turns off new WebSRT features if  
</I>&gt;<i> they have a code path that supports WebSRT features?
</I>
I think many media player developers would be hesitant to include a full  
HTML parser just for parsing (Web)SRT, especially since they'd also need a  
layout engine to get anything more than they would get from a simpler  
parser.

I do think it's a good idea to make the WebSRT handle existing SRT content  
as well as possible. The encoding issue is easy to side-step by just  
saying that that's a preprocessing step.

&gt;<i> Or is #1 *impossible* due to the craziness of the legacy? (I thought any  
</I>&gt;<i> given .srt consumer only has a single code path and implemetation-wise  
</I>&gt;<i> there aren't already multiple .srt format even though doom9 spec-wise  
</I>&gt;<i> there are at least two.)
</I>
There are some issues with the current WebSRT parser that I've been  
meaning to send mail about, but by my impression is that it's not  
impossible to define a parser which works well enough to replace existing  
ones.
