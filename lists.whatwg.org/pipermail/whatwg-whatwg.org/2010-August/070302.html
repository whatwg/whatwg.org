It doesn't seem to be overriding the users default any more than if
the video or audio track had been recorder with a different volume?

One use case is simply wanting to have some background music on a
page, but not wanting it to play in a volume as loud as what the track
was originally recorded in.

&gt;&gt;<i> However, if I have multiple videos on a page, all on autoplay, it would

</I>
Having the IDL attribute not reflect the content attribute I think
will be a source of confusion. The HTML DOM got this very wrong for
form values, and IE got it right. There were a great many people
confused about this for forms while gecko was still ramping up market
share back a few years ago. I think it would be much simpler to have
it behave like attributes like @disabed.
