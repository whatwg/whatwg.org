They aren't documented at all (afaik). Its a common design methodology to
design for only what you actually require at a given time.

&quot;There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are
known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don&#8217;t
know. But there are also unknown unknowns. These are things we do not know
we don&#8217;t know.&quot;

Given that one of the principals of HTML5 is to have a well designed product
that is easily understandable, I'd prefer to follow the path of simplistic,
minimal design.

Not one where every example found will be implemented&#8212;I'd like to think that
a browser vendor would find it very difficult to schedule the time to
implement such a full featured method of handling every date representation
known to man, rather than &quot;other awesome feature x&quot;.
