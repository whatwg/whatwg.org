</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;Evil Lawyer&quot; and &quot;Defendant&quot; aren't pronounced.  Their meanings (and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; silence) are deduced from English conventions about punctuation.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would prefer a semantic tag.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why? What problem would a semantic tag solve? The default styling here 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to not need any particular element; the above is perfectly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understandable as is as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For written output, yes, the convention works.

</I>
You can in theory do that today using classes and Speech CSS. Do people do 
it? If not, it's not clear that there's enough demand to add this yet.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm expecting [scripts] to do something like increase the font size 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or change the background for lines *I* have to memorize for *my* 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; character [based on the semantic marked in the page identifying the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; character], or for cue lines that I have to recognize.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are there any examples of this in the wild? Since this is technically 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible today, if it's a use case important enough that we should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address it, it should be easy enough to find examples of this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm very reluctant to provide features for hypothetical problems that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't stem from a real market need. (If we start solving such 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems, we would fast find ourselves on the path to feature bloat.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't acted much since finding the internet.  I have seen plenty of 
</I>&gt;<i> printed scripts in which this was done manually with a highlighter for 
</I>&gt;<i> rehearsals.  I would expect today's equivalent to be done at time of 
</I>&gt;<i> printing, rather than by a helpful web site.
</I>
Highlighting someone's lines can be done using &lt;mark&gt;.


&gt;<i> So the need is there; the question is whether the need is too 
</I>&gt;<i> specialized (like the various poetry elements) ... if the only use were 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, I would say that it was too specialized, but I would also use 
</I>&gt;<i> it for photo credits (the italicized captions), etc.  Whether that then 
</I>&gt;<i> makes it too much of a catchall element -- maybe.
</I>
Credit for a photograph and the name of the speaker in a script seem like 
wildly different use cases with very little, if any, overlap. I don't 
think it makes sense to consider them together.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I would expect it to be used by some scrapers looking for stock 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; photos.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure what you mean. Wouldn't fingerprinting the photos be more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effective?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking of scrapers acting on behalf of a consumer -- collecting 
</I>&gt;<i> a bunch of photos that you would be allowed to use.
</I>
This is a mostly solved problem today -- sites like Flickr and Google 
Image Search provide license filters in their search tools.


&gt;<i> Plenty of model and photographer websites are largely devoted to finding 
</I>&gt;<i> each other; I assume that this is because photographers are looking to 
</I>&gt;<i> find (and then contact) models with a particular look, while models are 
</I>&gt;<i> looking to be photographed by photographers skilled in a certain style. 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this seems like a fairly specialized need, but I've seen in on 
</I>&gt;<i> several sites, and it again gets met by an attribution or credits 
</I>&gt;<i> element.
</I>
This seems like an incredibly specialised need that is best solved by 
special-purpose databases and tools than by the Web's markup language.
