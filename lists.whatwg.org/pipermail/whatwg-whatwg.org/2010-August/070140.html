&gt;<i> HTML and CSS have predefined structures within which their languages grow

</I>
The parser has the &quot;bad cue loop&quot; concept for ignoring supposedly bogus  
lines. Seems extensible to me.


&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, that's why the tools should be updated to support the standard

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They don't have their own variant of SRT - they only have their own

</I>
That comes down to the same thing in my opinion. This is like saying  
browsers did not all have their own variant of HTML4.


&gt;<i> Some will tolerate crap at the end of the &quot;--&gt;&quot; line. Others won't.  
</I>&gt;<i> That's no break of &quot;conformance&quot; to the basic &quot;spec&quot; as given in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format</A> . They all
</I>&gt;<i> interoperate on the basic SRT format. But they don't interoperate on the
</I>&gt;<i> WebSRT format. That's why WebSRT has to be a new format.
</I>
By that reasoning HTML5 would have had to be a new format too. And CSS 2.1  
as opposed to CSS 2, etc.


&gt;&gt;<i> (And if they really just take in text like that they should at least run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some kind of validation so not all kinds of garbage can get in.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not a requirement of the &quot;spec&quot;. It's requirement is to render
</I>&gt;<i> whatever characters are given in cues. That's why it is so simple.
</I>
But it is not so simple because various extensions are out there in the  
wild and are used so the concerns you have with respect to WebSRT already  
apply.


&gt;<i> Sure. All I need to do is rename the file. Not much trouble at all.  
</I>&gt;<i> Better than believing I can just copy stuff from others since it's  
</I>&gt;<i> apparently the same format and then it breaks the SRT environment that I  
</I>&gt;<i> already have and that works.
</I>
At least with the copy approach you would still see something in your SRT  
environment. The &lt;ruby&gt; bits would just be ignored or some such.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's already part of Ian's proposal: it already supports multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different approaches of parsing cues. No extra complexity here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually that is not true. There is only one approach to parsing in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ian's proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A the moment, cues can have one of two different types of content:
</I>&gt;<i> (see  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#syntax-0">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#syntax-0</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So that means in essence two different parsers.
</I>
Per the parser section there is only one. See the end of
