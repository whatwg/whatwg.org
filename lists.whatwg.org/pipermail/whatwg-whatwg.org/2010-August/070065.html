What problem would this solve?


&gt;<i> It is disallowed in XHTML
</I>
(I assume you mean &quot;&lt;&quot; is disallowed in XHTML.)

Convergence with XML syntax rules is not a goal. Being a superset of those 
rules where possible is a minor secondary goal, but that is achieved 
either way in this case.


&gt;<i> It is disallowed in HTML 4.01
</I>
Convergence with HTML4 is not a goal.


&gt;<i> Disallowing it in HTML5 would avoid unnecessary divergence, and also 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes simplify parsing.
</I>
It wouldn't affect parsing.


A goal of HTML5 is to make the language have no useless restrictions. This 
argues for enabling people to put characters like &quot;&gt;&quot; in attributes.

This kind of error in practice gets caught soon enough anyway.

On the contrary, the more they break the less likely it is they will 
continue to be used. In practice, there is no way to use regular 
expressions reliably with HTML. We shouldn't encourage it.

Indeed.

I don't think it's every acceptable to have undefined behaviour on issues 
as critical as how to parse a document, valid or not.


&gt;<i> HTML5 has a very clear specification of conformance, and a validator is 
</I>&gt;<i> widely available.  If I build a tool that guarantees correct behavior 
</I>&gt;<i> only on conforming inputs, then users can easily check their documents 
</I>&gt;<i> for conformance before using my tool.  If my tool has additional 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions, then I need to write my own validator, and answer a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> questions.
</I>
I recommend just using a conforming HTML parser.


&gt;<i> I was inspired to suggest this restriction after using mod_layout for 
</I>&gt;<i> Apache, which inserts a banner at the top of a page.  It works by doing 
</I>&gt;<i> a wildcard search for &quot;&lt;body*&gt;&quot;.  There are a number of obvious ways to 
</I>&gt;<i> break this [1]; one of them is by having &quot;&gt;&quot; in an attribute value.  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure there are many thousands of such programs around the world.
</I>
They should be fixed. :-)


&gt;<i> It sounds like most experts here would prefer to allow &quot;&gt;&quot; in attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> values in conforming documents, and that's fine.  I don't fully 
</I>&gt;<i> understand the advantage, but I won't argue against consensus.
</I>
Expert opinions and consensus aren't the law of the land here, it's use 
cases, arguments, and most importantly data that count. See Philip`'s 
comment at the very bottom of this e-mail.


&gt;<i> [1] A javascript line like &quot;width&lt;bodywidth &amp;&amp; height&gt;bodyheight&quot; would 
</I>&gt;<i> also break it, as would an appropriately constructed comment.  It might 
</I>&gt;<i> be possible to construct a regexp for this that functions correctly on 
</I>&gt;<i> all conformant HTML5 documents.  Such a regexp would be considerably 
</I>&gt;<i> simpler if &quot;&gt;&quot; were disallowed in attribute values.
</I>
Regular expressions are the wrong tool for parsing HTML. HTML isn't 
regular.

</I>&gt;<i> Replacing &quot;&gt;&quot; with &quot;&gt;&quot; is already a good practice in XML and HTML. 
</I>
Why? &quot;&gt;&quot; doesn't mean anything special where it could be confused for text 
except in unquoted attribute values, and good practice there is to quote 
attribute values whose values are free-form text.


&gt;<i> Some HTML attributes already forbid it (it is allowed in CDATA 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes, forbidden in %Text attributes).
</I>
This doesn't apply anymore.


&gt;<i> Since XML 2 has been stopped, I think it is an occasion for HTML to make 
</I>&gt;<i> the good practice replaced by a new restriction
</I>
I disagree with the premise of this statement, as noted above (it's not a 
good practice), so it doesn't make sense to add a restriction.


&gt;<i> and in the same time lighten parsing processes which are not browser 
</I>&gt;<i> related.
</I>
Changing the syntax requirements has no effect on the parsing 
requirements.


&gt;<i> Why changing the HTML spec instead of adding a restriction when we want 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&gt;&quot; to be forbidden ? Because I think we should all want &quot;&gt;&quot; to be 
</I>&gt;<i> forbidden.
</I>
I don't think we do. :-)


&gt;<i> It is already quite deprecated to use it directly in HTML attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> values. We can always use &quot;&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&gt;&quot; as we already use &quot;&lt;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of &quot;&lt;&quot;.
</I>
On the contrary, we've only just added an attribute where HTML in 
attribute values is the whole point (srcdoc=&quot;&quot;).

That's the most convincing argument.
