The other browsers implemented the first draft, which was then changed 
based on implementation feedback. Hopefully the other browsers will update 
their implementation now to fix the bugs that were present in the original 
version of the spec, leading to everyone doing the same thing. :-)


&gt;<i> OTOH however, the description for the [NETWORK_EMPTY] state is as

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NETWORK_EMPTY (numeric value 0)
</I>&gt;<i> The element has not yet been initialized. All attributes are in their 
</I>&gt;<i> initial states.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and for NETWORK_NO_SOURCE is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NETWORK_NO_SOURCE (numeric value 3)
</I>&gt;<i> The element's resource selection algorithm is active, but it has failed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is more consistent with the implementations of the other browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> and also consistent with the meaning of NETWORK_EMPTY and 
</I>&gt;<i> NETWORK_NO_SOURCE.
</I>
The definitions were a bit confusing. I've fixed them. The algorithm was 
correct, however.

For the record, when the spec contradicts itself, and one part is 
normative (such as the algorithm here) and another is non-normative (such 
as the definitions here) then always assume the normative part is wrong. I 
often forget to update the non-normative parts.

NETWORK_EMPTY is the state you'll find immediately after creating a 
&lt;video&gt; element with no src=&quot;&quot; element:

   document.createElement('video').readyState == NETWORK_EMPTY

As far as I can tell, the spec already guarantees that.

Just have a bunch of &lt;video&gt;s in the markup, and when one ends, hide it 
and show the next one. Don't start dynamically manipulating &lt;source&gt; 
elements, that's just asking for pain.

If you really must do it all using script, just use canPlayType and the 
&lt;video src=&quot;&quot;&gt; attribute, don't mess around with &lt;source&gt;.

Not necessarily finished. The idea is just that the resource selection 
algorithm might run on another thread, and the way the spec is written 
allows the UA to synchronise at very predictable points (e.g. when 
showModalDialag() is invoked, or when the HTML parser isn't inserting 
elements, or while waiting for a style sheet to load so that a &lt;script&gt; 
can be run).

I don't really understand what use case this would solve.

What's the use case for modifying &lt;source&gt;? It just seems like a much more 
complicated way of doing things that necessary. Just use &lt;video src=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
and your life will be way easier.

Any running task is &quot;not stable&quot;, not just running script. For example, 
you shouldn't run a synchronous section while the parser is adding 
elements to the DOM.


&gt;<i> The only step in any video-related algorithm one can reach from a script

</I>
Sure you can. The rest of the algorithm is asynchronous, so a script could 
have started when you reach them. Or the parser could be adding elements, 
or you could be handling incoming network traffic in a way that affects 
the DOM (e.g. EventSource could be about to fire an event), etc.

Indeed, that's another point where the event loop will run the synchronous

</I>
Certainly &quot;pause&quot; is not great.

Currently the things I'm aware of that trigger &quot;pause&quot; are:

 - the onbeforeunload prompt
 - alert()
 - confirm()
 - prompt()
 - printing (including print() and user-triggered printing)
 - getting or setting document.cookie*
 - manipulating the localStorage object*

(Cases marked * are side-effects of needing to obtain the storage mutex.)

I don't see how to get around needing to pause for any of these. For 
example, consider alert(): if you don't pause, then timeouts could run, 
and a timeout that fires alert() could result in infinite alerts. You 
could spin the event loop but blocking task sources that could end up 
running script, but I don't think that would leave you with much 
(possibly nothing) so I don't see the point.

That should always alert 3; the synchronous section doesn't run before the

It is. Each task that the networking task source places on the task queue 
while the fetching algorithm runs must then fill the parser's input stream 
with the fetched bytes and cause the HTML parser to perform the 
appropriate processing of the input stream.

Can cause. Step 3 of the Otherwise clause at the end of the &quot;An end tag 
whose tag name is &quot;script&quot;&quot; section of The &quot;text&quot; insertion mode.

How so?


&gt;<i> The parser example above alerts 0 or 3 depending on whether the sync

It should always alert 3. The networkState is set _before_ the sync

The sync section runs whenever the parser decides it's time to run it -- 
conceptually, you can treat any sequence of bytes processed by the parser 
in an uninterrupted fashion as a task.

Because evaluating a &lt;source&gt; can involve a multi-megabyte network load. 
It would also mean that you could get very unpredictable behaviour, e.g. 
if earlier &lt;source&gt;s were to suddenly become available again or change 
type (e.g. as might happen if the page was loaded from cache while the 
user was logging into a wireless network with a captive portal).

What exactly are you proposing we do instead?

I couldn't come up with a mechanism that didn't have some hysteresis in 
the face of pathological DOM manipulation. I figured if we were going to 
have some, I'd just make it so that the spec was the simplest necessary to 
handle the normal use cases, and had the most optimistic performance 
characteristics (least built-in delays).

However, if you can come up with a mechanism that doesn't exihibit 
hysteresis -- i.e. has the same behaviour regardless of the speed of the 
network or of the implementation, and independent of the order in which 
nodes are added to the DOM, without requiring that the UA wait beyond 
parsing the first &lt;source&gt; to start downloading resources -- then I'm all 
for adopting that.

What it returns depends entirely on what happened when you fetched
