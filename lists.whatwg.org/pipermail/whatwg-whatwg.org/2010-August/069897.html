The problem with that is that they still get submitted, so it seems weird 
to not validate them. It seems authors should be careful not to make the 
hidden controls be invalid.

I considered it, but really we should also also stop submission in that 
case, and that seems like it's starting to make things a little less 
intuitive than I'd like. It's really up to the author to make sure that 
something that's irrelevant (hidden=&quot;&quot;) is not part of a form that is 
user-submittable.


&gt;<i> Adding display:none is not.  That's a big layering violation that we

Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If one of the controls is not being rendered (e.g. it has the hidden 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute set) then user agents may report a script error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sentence is about process against controls of which validation

</I>&gt;<i> I think UA doesn't need to validate such controls.
</I>
I think, as the sentence above suggests, it's better to report this as a 
page error than to not validate the control. Chrome already reports this 
problem in the console.


&gt;<i> The Chrome bug report is here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45640">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45640</A>
</I>
The bug there is that Chrome is filling in a control that isn't visible, 
and, even worse, that it is filling it with a value that the user couldn't 
himself enter manually. That's a bug (two bugs in fact), but it has 
nothing to do with reporting validation errors -- the error should not be 
able to occur.

Indeed.

</I>
Just don't autofill controls with invalid values, and don't autofill 
hidden controls. :-)

Do you have more specific URLs I could look at for these?
