This is a bulk reply to the feedback that resulted from the following blog 
post from YouTube's API team:

</I>
Indeed. To reiterate for the record:

&gt;<i> 1. Standard video format
</I>
This is up to browser vendors; we have several options. The market will 
likely end up resolving this.

&gt;<i> 2. Robust video streaming
</I>
This is at the stage where we should get browser implementation 
experience.

&gt;<i> 3. Content Protection
</I>
Fingerprinting is already possible; DRM is mathematically impossible. See 
below for slightly more on this, but this was covered in depth in the 
threads so I won't add much.

&gt;<i> 4. Encapsulation + embedding
</I>
Should be possible with existing technologies (a number of people 
discussed this on these threads so I won't reiterate further here).

&gt;<i> 5. Fullscreen video
</I>
See recent threads; this will likely be solved in due course via CSSOM 
extensions.

&gt;<i> 6. Camera and Microphone access
</I>
This is in early stages, but see the &lt;device&gt; element for ideas here. It's 
currently stalled waiting for people to volunteer to work on protocol-side 
work.

Content protection is silly because it is impossible to simultaneously 
prevent someone from accessing data, and allow someone to access it. It's 
_especially_ silly in an open standard implemented by open source 
software, since you can't even rely on the usual obfuscation technique. (I 
haven't responded to any other e-mails on these threads regarding DRM, 
since none got beyond this problem.)


&gt;<i> For pay-per-video services I would think a watermark + sue policy for 
</I>&gt;<i> files distributed over HTML5/HTTP could handle content protection as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as any flash based solution.
</I>
Sure, that's already possible.


&gt;<i> For pay-per-minute or pay-per-byte services I believe the HTTP and/or 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 specification needs some minor changes to allow the server to 
</I>&gt;<i> dictate the amount of data the UA should attempt to fetch from an open 
</I>&gt;<i> and standard file over an open and standard protocol.
</I>
Why can't the server control this already?

</I>&gt;<i> The server is then expected to keep this connection open (idling or

</I>
There is definitely room for more advanced protocols than just straight 
HTTP for media streaming. This is an area where we should start with 
browser experimentation.

Exposing this information is one of the features queued up for the next 
version (after we get the subtitles stuff sorted out).

You can see the current list of such feedback here:
