Why?

Is this common? Do you have examples of pages doing this?

It all depends on the use cases. Without use cases, there's no way to 
evaluate the proposals.

Completeness is not a good design strategy. :-) You end up with lots of 
things that need implementing that are not well tested and end up being 
quite buggy.

I couldn't figure out how to enter any BC years there. For AD years it 
seems to be fine -- and indeed, unless we provide a Julian calendar 
widget, that page would never be able to use our work anyway. It is well 
outside the 80% use case target.

This page seems to be fine as is; why would you need a new input control 
for this?

It's not clear what this would do. Wouldn't the user be the one who should 
pick the calendar? Nothing stops a browser from exposing the date widget 
as a Julian Day calendar widget.

</I>
For &lt;input type=date&gt;, I would definitely expect Japanese UAs to offer 
this kind of feature. Once this takes off, if it would be helpful in 
Japan, we can definitely extend the feature to type=year if people often 
need to specify years in one format and have trouble remembering how that 
format maps to the other. I don't know how common that is.

Is there any indication that browsers want this opportunity? (Why would 
they make their input control be styled differently?)


&gt;<i> * this semantic gives robots the opportunity to understand that a form

</I>
They're going to need to know what kind of year it is (birth year? year an 
album had its millionth sale? expiration year of a cookie?) to make the UI 
in any way sane, so just having type=year isn't going to cut it.

Why would you want a calendar tool for a year?

Yes, but why for a year? Would you ever really drag and drop an event 
rather than just type the year?

Do sites really want to support two-digit years? Other than for credit 
card expiry dates, I really don't remember the last time I entered a 
two-digit year.


&gt;<i> - Input year name or number in a different system (including

</I>
Non-contemporary dates aren't in the most common 80% of use cases, and all 
the pages that people have cited showing such cases have always needed far 
more features than we'd likely provide, so I'm not sure this is 
compelling. Are any browsers interested in implementing such a feature?

We first start small, catering for the biggest block of use cases, and 
then add more features as we get experience showing how people use it.

Allowing Japanese-locale users enter Japanese eras instead of Gregorian 
years does seem like the most compelling use case presented so far. I 
don't know that it's compelling enough to justify adding it now, though, 
before we've seen how well the last set of input type additions are used.

If they all do it in their own fashion, do they each have the same use
