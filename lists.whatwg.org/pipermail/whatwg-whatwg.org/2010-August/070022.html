According to the spec the &quot;i element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood&quot;. It's very easy to do that in speech but very hard in writing. That's why we have emoticons and &lt;irony&gt; tags. The new semantics are pretty solid for i.

Admittedly, it's harder to make the case for the b element. b is closely tied to presentation. Its purpose is to &quot;stylistically offset&quot; something. Just like the mark element is used to highlight something in a different context, b is used to highlight something in the original context. In both cases leaving the highlighting out wouldn't change the meaning. b is an accessibility feature which makes it easier to identify key parts regardless of medium.

I'd agree that b has the weakest semantics of all the semantic elements in the spec. Using spans with classes would work just as well.

You're implying that these things are conventionally bolded or italicized as an end in itself. Most of the time there's a reason why things are bolded or italicized other than &quot;I don't like regular type&quot;. The restricted set of means for conveying semantics in type-setting doesn't mean we can't use a richer set of elements in HTML. Even if at the end of the day all that richness is presented in bold and italics. Google doesn't care ;-)
