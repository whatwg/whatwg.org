Quick terminology point: in this e-mail, I use the term &quot;sniff&quot; to mean 
&quot;examine the first few bytes of a resource, and determine its type 
heuristically&quot; in contrast with assuming that the type of a file is that 
given by its MIME type (or, heaven forfend, the file extension).

As Simon says, it was added based on a request from Mozilla engineers. :-)

Currently that is indeed the case, but only Opera does it.

I spoke to various browser vendor engineers about this.

Microsoft's position is, as far as I can tell, that there's no point 
looking at the Content-Type header, so they always sniff the types of the 
video data once they've decided to try downloading it. I have no idea what 
algorithms they use, or how they would handle cases like Matroska (which 
doesn't have a guaranteed finite signature at the start of the file).

Safari does crazy things right now that we won't go into; for the 
purposes of this discussion we'll assume Safari can change.

Chrome right now sniffs like IE, modulo some bugs with text/plain that 
affect (only) the UI, but engineers tell me they're willing to change.

Opera does what the spec suggests. That is, if the type isn't supported 
then it is treated as a signal to give up without waiting for data to 
sniff; if the type _is_ supported then it isn't trusted, the data is 
obtained and examined to determine its real type.

Mozilla respects the Content-Type religiously, even if it gets data in a 
type it supports labelled with another type it supports, but engineers 
tell me they're willing to change.

As I see it we have two possible destinations: we can do what the spec 
says now, which is a somewhat reasonable (IMHO) compromise between 
religiously following the Content-Type, and being pragmatic about people 
getting the type wrong sometimes; or we can do what IE9 will do, and just 
always sniff once we've decided to try looking at the data, always 
ignoring the Content-Type headers. I think we all know where we're going 
to end up, but for now I've left the spec as is.

Agreed. Right now the spec says that it is considered not recognised (as

I think 'application/octet-stream' isn't a video type. The browser can't 
play it. It's just that it's ignored in certain cases.

It doesn't so much check it as do what the spec says, which is to just use 
it as another signal that the file isn't going to be understandable.


&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed, so it seems that sniffing is always required, unless we expect

</I>
Indeed. The spec doesn't say to use the codecs=&quot;&quot; parameter to figure out 
what the file is -- just to use it to wean out the cases where the file is 
definitely not playable (because its type is something the player knows it 
doesn't know).

Would be solved by implementing the spec, since the spec hard-codes 
application/octet-stream as being a signal to sniff.

I can't tell what types were being sent for these, so no idea if they 
would have been fixed by following the spec.

Would not have been solved. Could be solved by going the IE route or 
making text/plain magic here like application/octet-stream (we have 
precedent for that, sadly).

There are two ways to do that: the way Gecko does it today (try to play 
it by decoding it as the given type), and the way the spec and Opera do it 
(if it's 'maybe' or 'probably', then sniff).

The Microsoft guys responded to my suggestion that they might want to 
implement something like this with &quot;what's the benefit of doing that?&quot;. 
It's a tough question, in this context, given that there's no possibilty 
of script execution or other privilege escalation with the types we're 
talking about (currently, anyway). &quot;It's what the specs say&quot; doesn't seem 
to be a particularly compelling argument for them.

</I>
Well, they can still use type=&quot;&quot; on &lt;source&gt;, right? We're only talking 
about the case where the type is either missing on &lt;source&gt;, or there's 
only one src=&quot;&quot;, or the types on &lt;source&gt; is one that the user agent 
supports, in which case it seems reasonable to at least check that the 
server is not wrong after all. Also, sniffing the first few bytes is 
basically free, since they're highly likely to come in the same packet as 
the type anyway.

canPlayType() is now hardcoded as not supporting application/octet-stream 
even though that type is otherwise not considered one that isn't supported 
(i.e. is a type that sniffs).

For text/plain vs text/html it makes sense, and indeed in general for 
text/* types, I agree. However, for distinguishable binary types, what's 
the benefit?

It seems that sniffing is context-sensitive. When you're looking for an 
image, there are certain signatures to look for. When you're looking for 
an appcache manifest, there are other signatures to look for. It's only 
for some very specific types -- text/plain being the main one -- that you 
can't sniff the type without out-of-band metadata. For everything else, we 
could have included context-sensitive signatures.

Sadly, the boat has sailed for text/html and XML at this point, but for 
binary types, and for contexts where text/plain isn't a contender, why 
bother doing anything but sniff?

That's not incorrect. The type with no parameters is a special case that 
corresponds to a common configuration default. The case with parameters is 
not that case, and represents likely intentional configuration and thus 
clearly not a video format the UA supports.


&gt;<i> It's also not clear whether the note applies to all parameters or just

</I>
The normative text you quote doesn't mention any specific parameters.

Regarding codecs=&quot;&quot; in particular, it's an implementation reality that 
user agents that support it are likely to support it regardless of the 
type, so there's really no point trying to maintain an artificial boundary 
of which types it has semantics for and which it doesn't.
