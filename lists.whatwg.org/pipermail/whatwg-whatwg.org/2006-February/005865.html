I expect the spec to (when I get to gEBI) say that all characters must be 
supported. It's easier to implement, for one.

Yeah, that's already water long under the bridge.

Indeed. WHATWG will happily host schemas and DTDs if people write them 
(see, e.g., syntax.whatwg.org; fantasai maintains that). However, none of 
them will be given any sort of preferential status. They're just 
implementations.

The spec has text to this effect in places now; let me know if you have 
more specific text you'd like to see. I don't want to be too strong, since 
if you're using XML, exactly how you do so is the problem of the XML spec, 
not the Web Apps / XHTML5 spec.

Currently the spec says you trigger quirks mode if there isn't a &lt;!DOCTYPE 
HTML&gt;, and you feel like it (both conditions must be met). I may make this 
more specific in due course; do people think we should?

I'm also tempted to just codify many parts of quirks mode; do people want 
to do that instead?


&gt;<i> &gt; Or at the very least use something that would not confuse people into

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you want to replace &quot;NONSGML&quot; with &quot;THIS-IS-NOT-SGML&quot;?
</I>
Well, we're now down to just &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;, since that was the shortest 
I could make it while still triggering strict mode (well, &lt;!DOCTYPEHTML&gt; 
worked too, but that just looks silly).

Suggestions on shortening it are welcome.

I really wish we could ditch the DOCTYPE altogether. The number of pages 
that use quirks mode is just sad.

Indeed, it's a DOCTYPE token, and it generates (in the right place) a 
DOCTYPE DOM node. It's not an XML or SGML DOCTYPE per se...
