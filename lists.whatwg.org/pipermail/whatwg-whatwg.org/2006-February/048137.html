</I>
You could use SGML tools with it, including well-established validator 
tools; the parsing model (for compliant documents) is very clear; SGML has 
a lot of abbreviation syntaxes that make it quick to write markup, it 
means we're not reinventing the wheel.

Unfortunately, in practice, nobody uses SGML tools, validators are unable 
to catch a number of important (computer-checkable) conformance problems, 
the parsing model doesn't handle non-compliant documents and the majority 
of documents are non-compliant, the abbreviation syntaxes are extremely 
complicated and largely unimplemented, and incompatible with existing 
content, and the wheel was already reinvented.

</I>
Indeed; the term &quot;valid&quot; in an XML/SGML context is used to mean a specific 
subset of &quot;conformant&quot;, but most users don't know this and assume it means 
&quot;fully conformant&quot;.

I've tried to work around this in the spec.

I've put this in the spec, I hope that's ok.

Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently expressive language would go along way, though.
</I>
For WF2 it may be far enough, I'm not sure. For HTML5 I'm pretty sure no 
Schema language (short of a turing-complete one) is expressive enough.


&gt;<i> I notice that &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; src=&quot;some url&quot; checked=&quot;true&quot;&gt; is valid
</I>&gt;<i> according to the schema for XHTML.
</I>
Indeed.

It'll probably be conformant in HTML5 as well, to be honest, because you 
might want to set things up for a dynamic change of |type|. I don't know 
where to draw the line there. (Similarly; should empty paragraphs be 
conformant? I often use empty paragraphs as somewhere to later fill in 
some text.)


&gt;<i> Actually I think it would be beneficial for interoperability and perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> discovery of weaknesses in the spec, if several schemas were developed 
</I>&gt;<i> by independent parties during the call for implementation.
</I>
Absolutely.

It's not clear to me what the purpose would be.

What use?

Hear hear!


&gt;<i> As HTML applications becomes more complex it becomes more important that

</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> &gt; now I realise it's to the advantage of existing browser manufacturers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to rubber stamp complicated heuristic behaviour they've already solved 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into a spec (it prevents new entrants from coming along)  but how is

</I>
In HTML5 there is less and less that is left up to reverse engineering. 
Hopefully that addresses your concern; I hope to continue in this 
direction to the point where eventually maybe there will not be any need 
for reverse engineering at all.
