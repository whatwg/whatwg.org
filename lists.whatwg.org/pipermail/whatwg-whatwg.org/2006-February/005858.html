Validators are not conformant conformance checkers. They are validators, 
which is a subset of conformance checking. You could implement other 
subsets, there's nothing particularily magical about validators that make 
them any more appropriate than other incomplete conformance checkers.


&gt;<i> I don't see any reason why such a statement needs to be included at all.
</I>
Because people rely on validators in a way that implies they think they 
are getting a complete conformance check.


&gt;<i> If OpenSP was non-conformant, then any current or future UA that is 
</I>&gt;<i> built with OpenSP as the parser would be non-conformant also, which 
</I>&gt;<i> should not be the case.
</I>
It is the case. HTML5 is not an SGML application. Any UA based on an SGML 
parser would not be able to handle today's existing Web content.


&gt;<i> What the?  I disagree with that.  HTML should remain an application of 
</I>&gt;<i> SGML, and browser's should be built to conform properly.  Aside from the 
</I>&gt;<i> unimplemented SHORTTAG features (which can be turned off in the DTD 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway) and the mostly undefined error handling, what about HTML 5 will 
</I>&gt;<i> be so incompatible with SGML to warrant such a decision?
</I>
Why do you discard the error handling so lightly? It is critical. To a 
rough approximation, all the content on the Web is errorneous, invalid, or 
non-conformant. We have to handle it.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Also, while on the topic of handling invalid documents, is this spec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; going to attempt to address the &lt;x&gt;&lt;y&gt;&lt;/x&gt;&lt;/y&gt; problem?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably not, as there is no generally accepted solution. In fact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is no known solution (to my knowledge) that is entirely 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; satisfactory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, since no existing browser I know of handles it in the most 
</I>&gt;<i> logical and, IMHO, the most correct way (ie. when a parent element is 
</I>&gt;<i> closed, all unclosed children elements should be closed and not reopened 
</I>&gt;<i> after); and no two browsers that I know of create completely compatible 
</I>&gt;<i> DOMs with any other method.
</I>
We've addressed it anyway, in a way that manages to remain closely 
compatible with Safari and Mozilla, and mostly compatible with IE and 
Opera.

</I>
More importantly, users don't know it. Changing the behaviour of the UA 
would make them consider that UA broken. That would prevent that UA from 
getting any market share, and would make the spec irrelevant as all UAs 
would end up ignoring it.


&gt;<i> &gt; and probably less market share for the browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought this was about standardisation, not some marketing gimmick for

</I>
There's no point having standards if nobody uses them. The browsers won't 
use them if they would end up losing customers as a result.


&gt;<i> Documents that contain &lt;/ within script and style elements, that are not 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt; and &lt;/style&gt; respectively (or the SHORTTAG version &lt;/&gt;) are 
</I>&gt;<i> broken.
</I>
Not as far as the user can see -- they work fine.


&gt;<i> I see no problem with defining error handling for broken documents, but 
</I>&gt;<i> no need to break conformance with SGML in the process.
</I>
The error handling must be compatible with existing content. Existing 
content is incompatible with SGML.


&gt;<i> HTML is an application of SGML, regardless of all the broken 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations and documents we currently have, and I don't want to see 
</I>&gt;<i> that changed.
</I>
HTML was only an application of SGML from versions 2 to 4. The original 
version, the second version (HTML+), and the new version (HTML5) are not.

This is clearly not the case, since it is trivial to show 
machine-checkable constraints that DTDs or Schemas can't express. (The 
exact range of such constraints varies based on the DTD or Schema.)

A validator is an incomplete conformance checker. It's like one side of 
the rectangle.

Lints are tools that check for things that the specification does not 
require, generally; they are not conformance checkers.


&gt;<i> Yes, but &quot;Conformance checkers that only perform validation&quot; are, unless

Correct. They are incomplete conformance checkers.

The syntax of the datetime attribute, for example.

A user agent whose intent is to only implement half the specification may 
do its job correctly, but that doesn't make it a conformant 
implementation. It's no different whether the UA is a conformance checker 
or a Web browser.

The same could be applied to Web browsers. History has shown again and 
again that such competition raises the quality of all involved, however, 
rather than lowering it and killing the market as you suggest.

They are included in HTML5, but excluded in XHTML5.

There are billions of such documents. Are you volunteering?
