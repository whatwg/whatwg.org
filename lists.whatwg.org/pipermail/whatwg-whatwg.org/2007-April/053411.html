This, along with the checkin I just made, should resolve all the e-mails 
that have been sent regarding &lt;base&gt;. Please let me know if I missed 
anything or if you see any new issues.

Nothing much. The base element will appear in the DOM (as a child of the 
&lt;div&gt;), but it will not have any effect.

</I>
None of the above. It appears in the DOM but has no effect.

The latter is the option I'm following for now. Note that browsers all do 
_different_ things for target=&quot;&quot; than for href=&quot;&quot;. The spec has made them 
act the same for now. I'm not sure this is workable, we'll have to see 
when the browser vendors try to get this interoperable. I can't imagine 
that it's a huge issue given that the browsers are so far from each other 
in terms of what they do here. I'm going to do a study of some subset of 
the Web to see how common this is (at least the static case; I can't 
really do much about the scripted case).

Done.

</I>
What more is there to say? Isn't it defined enough?

Indeed.

The xml:base here has no effect.

</I>
No, the &lt;base&gt; element sets the &quot;document entity's base URI&quot;, and is 
resolved relative to the &quot;base URI from the encapsulating entity&quot; or the 
&quot;URI used to retrieve the entity&quot;. See RFC2396.

You didn't elaborate on what you considered surprising, so I can't tell if 
what the spec now says also suffers from these problems. Could you let me 
know if you think the spec as written would give &quot;surprising&quot; results when 
using XInclude, and which results it is you consider surprising? Thanks.
