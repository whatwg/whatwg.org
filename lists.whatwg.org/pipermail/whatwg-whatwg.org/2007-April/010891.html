I agree.  The point is to get consistency between vendors, not to  
wait until they're already consistent.  If we waited for everyone to  
support the same thing, nothing then would be supported.

Thank you Karl for pointing out the Widgets draft.  I can appreciate  
the similarities, but I'm not convinced that that implementation  
would work in this case (as it reads today).  While Microsoft  
Sidebar, Google Desktop, Apple Dashboard or any other widget runtime  
environment would recognize the file and try to open it, there is  
nothing in the draft that promotes Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari  
or any other browser to do the same.  For example, Safari can't even  
be used to open a .wdgt file.

For an archived website or an HTML-based document, you would want to  
be able to rely on the user having a viewer on his or her system that  
would recognize the file.  In most cases, other than a widget, that  
viewer would be their browser.  Maybe there needs to be a draft for  
&quot;web documents&quot; that is virtually identical to the widget draft, but  
aimed at browser runtime environments and with a different file  
extension?  Any thoughts?
