Thanks for reading over this part.

&gt;<i> 1. 'media-loop-count' is an awkward name, especially with &quot;The  
</I>&gt;<i> default value of 1 means the item will play through once but will  
</I>&gt;<i> not loop.&quot;  We went through this with APNG, and ended up renaming  
</I>&gt;<i> that member.  I would suggest 'media-play-count' instead -- that  
</I>&gt;<i> way there is no ambiguity with what the number means.
</I>
We considered 'media-repeat-count' instead of 'media-loop-count', but  
that turned out to be more confusing. We really wanted all the  
looping-related properties to have consistent naming, and I don't  
think 'play' would work in the other places mentioned.

&gt;<i> 2. The descriptions for 'media-loop-start-time' and 'media-loop-end- 
</I>&gt;<i> time' don't match; start-time says &quot;sets the time at which the  
</I>&gt;<i> media item begins playing after looping&quot;, and end-time says &quot;sets  
</I>&gt;<i> the time at which the media item loops for the second and  
</I>&gt;<i> subsequent repetitions&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that start-time says &quot;sets the time index at which  
</I>&gt;<i> the media item starts playing for the second and subsequent  
</I>&gt;<i> repetitions&quot;, and that end-time says &quot;sets the time index at which  
</I>&gt;<i> the media item ends playing for the second and subsequent  
</I>&gt;<i> repetitions.&quot;  The language for end-time is still a little awkward,  
</I>&gt;<i> since &quot;ends playing&quot; could imply that it simply stops playing (and  
</I>&gt;<i> does not loop), but it's clearer than before.
</I>
I think the language might have ended up actually defining it wrong.  
The intent of 'media-loop-end-time' is that this is the point where  
you end where repeating, but on the last iteration you go all the way  
to 'media-end-time'. So if 'media-loop-count' has a value of 3, the  
three repetitions would go as follows:

media-start-time                                    ===&gt;       media- 
loop-end-time
                           media-loop-start-time   ===&gt;       media- 
loop-end-time
                           media-loop-start- 
time                                    ===&gt;       media-end-time

I'll update the spec.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. 'media-timing' I would get rid of completely; while a shorthand  
</I>&gt;<i> would be useful, I don't think that media-timing as specified  
</I>&gt;<i> really works. Shorthands for properties such as 'background' are  
</I>&gt;<i> understandable on their own; 'media-timing: playing 0s -0.5s 2 2s  
</I>&gt;<i> -4s 1' is very opaque.    If it's still desirable, I would remove  
</I>&gt;<i> the setting of start/end times and change the volume shorthand to  
</I>&gt;<i> only accept the symbolic names; e.g. 'media-timing: playing high  
</I>&gt;<i> 4;'... but I think that removing the shorthand entirely would be  
</I>&gt;<i> preferable.
</I>
I'll reply in more detail about media-timing in a later message.

Regards,
Maciej
