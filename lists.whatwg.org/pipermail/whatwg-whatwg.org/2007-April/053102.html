</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; what is the 'disposition' parameter?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea of a 'disposition-type' is to mark content with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presentational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information. See the Content-Disposition Header for MIME described in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RFC 1806 for an early example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be simpler to use &quot;video/ogg&quot; and &quot;audio/ogg&quot; as the base
</I>&gt;<i> types here? That would already tell you the intended disposition.
</I>

Please note that rfc4281 also mentions the problem that video/* bucket
types could have audio only included in them:

&quot;With each &quot;bucket&quot; type, a receiving agent only knows that it has a
   container format.  It doesn't even know whether content labeled
   video/3gpp or video/3gpp2 contains video; it might be audio only,
   audio and video, or video only.&quot;

Therefore, the video/* type does not clearly indicate which
application would be most suitable to be used with such a contant
type.

Ogg is more pragmatic in this respect:
application/ogg is for the bucket type
video/x-theora for the video codec stream (no audio)
audio/x-vorbis for the audio codec stream

Neither video/x-theora nor audio/x-vorbis actually tell you in what
container (bucket) your stream comes.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The specific proposal Silvia mentioned is to add the content-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disposition to the media-type to inform parsers of the general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nature of the content, even if they don't recognize the specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; codecs. The allowed values for the 'disposition' label come from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Dublin Core set. This is not part of RFC 4281, and as far as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know hasn't been formally documented with the IETF, but we do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think it's a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems redundant with the &quot;video/&quot; and &quot;audio/&quot; base types, and
</I>&gt;<i> adding such a feature just to make the point that the Ogg container
</I>&gt;<i> is universal seems like a stretch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This arose out of the need to discover or record &quot;audio&quot; vs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;audiovisual&quot; status for media files in the context of routing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the proper playback application, which has been particularly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contentious with the Ogg container since we have insisted that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such distinctions be made via metadata or file inspection instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of defining distinguishing filename extensions has has been done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with other containers. (MooV is perhaps another example.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> File inspection is not really workable for content coming from the
</I>&gt;<i> web that might be sent to an external app, so I think the Ogg
</I>&gt;<i> community should reconsider this stance on distinguishing file types
</I>&gt;<i> by primary use.
</I>

I totally agree - file inspection is not workable in many cases and
therefore the MIME type has to indicate all of this information: the
bucket type, the contained codecs, and the suggested type of
application to use.


&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In terms of user presentation, &quot;audio&quot; vs &quot;video&quot; vs &quot;text&quot; vs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;still image&quot; is the important distinction, while the 'codecs'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameter answers the more technical question of what playback
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capabilities are necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And indeed, MIME already has &quot;audio/&quot;, &quot;video/&quot;, &quot;text/&quot; and &quot;image/&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> base types to make this very distinction. It seems unhelpful to
</I>&gt;<i> invent a second way to say the same thing.
</I>
rfc4281 and many other digital media bucket formats show that this is
not an Ogg-only problem. Since multimedia comes in containers
(buckets) in order to serialise what is essentially time-parallel
data, there will always be a problem to describe both the container
and the containing type of data.

Since neither theora nor vorbis can stand on their own without a
container format (such as rtsp or ogg), video/x-theora or
audio/x-vorbis cannot indicate anything. They only make sense in
context. And the same applies, btw, to streaming text or images that
are part of a multimedia application. It's not as simple as dividing
the world into files of type application (sw), audio, video, text and
images. This simplistic world view has been overtaken by reality a
long time ago.

Best Regards,
Silvia.
