</I>
In that case, wouldn't it make more sense to make in an attribute on  
iframe, or some setting of the CSS properties, instead of a whole  
different element? Different elements with identical processing model  
is a red flag, at least when the processing model is complex.

One question I have is whether the &lt;include&gt; element would be limited  
to being a rectangular area, or if it could participate in inline  
flow, or act as multiple separate blocks that lay out independently.  
If the former, then I would suggest appropriate values of the CSS  
height and width properties make sense. If the latter, I think it  
could be pretty impractical to implement, and probably not worth the  
effort. Layout engines tend to assume that there is a CSS canvas and  
viewport at the root of the document and may not be prepared to  
inject content from another document into arbitrary points in the  
render tree.

In fact, if it is limited to same-site references as you suggest, I'm  
not sure what it really buys you over XMLHttpRequest and then setting  
innerHTML on the target element.
