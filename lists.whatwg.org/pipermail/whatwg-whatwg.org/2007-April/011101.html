People blocking _blank would indeed be rare, even more so author's
awareness of this, but I'd put the number of authors who test for
conformance as significantly higher. Those authors are imo likely to
look for a conformant alternative that works.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've argued my socks off trying to convince authors that they should

</I>
In the many discussions with authors I've had on this issue, I've not
yet encountered a reason for this practice that stood up to scrutiny,
but regularly the lack of rationale and pointing out the negatives
doesn't stop people from opening new windows despite it having been
pointed out that doing so is bad practice. The most common reasons given
are:

1) I like [often off-site] links opening in a new window, others will
too.
2) When moving to another site, not opening a new window would cause my
site to disappear (sometimes accompanied with the argument that this
would confuse people).
