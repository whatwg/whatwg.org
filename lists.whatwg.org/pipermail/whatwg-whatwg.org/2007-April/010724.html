</I>&gt;<i> I really don't think that's spinning - it's just a restatement of

</I>&gt;<i> the case for other browser vendors, we don't have to pay fees.&quot;,  
</I>&gt;<i> which is pretty much the same as &quot;[Apple would prefer MPEG because]  
</I>&gt;<i> other browsers would have to pay fees and we wouldn't&quot; - which is a  
</I>&gt;<i> financial advantage.
</I>
This isn't the first time you've restated something in what seems  
like a needlessly inflammatory way. Your earlier message in the  
thread basically said that unless Apple implements Ogg Theora, we  
&quot;don't actually have a commitment to interoperability&quot;.

&gt;<i> Where's the spin? If you don't want us to read those words at face  
</I>&gt;<i> value and draw the obvious conclusions, then don't list &quot;not having  
</I>&gt;<i> to pay fees&quot; as an advantage for you of MPEG.
</I>
The more charitable interpretation would be that this is a lack of  
disadvantage for Apple, rather than an unfair benefit. Not going to  
debate this further.

&gt;&gt;<i> We're fine with the current spec language. Saying nothing at all  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be better, but a SHOULD is fine. I followed up on this  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread because you seem to be advocating a mandatory requirement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe my first comment in this thread talked about SHOULD. I  
</I>&gt;<i> haven't mentioned MUST.
</I>
If the goal of your original was not to elevate the SHOULD  
requirement to a MUST, but rather to persuade Apple to implement Ogg  
even though we think we have good reasons not to, then you may want  
to try a different approach. Also, this list is probably not the  
right forum for such discussion.

Regards,
Maciej
