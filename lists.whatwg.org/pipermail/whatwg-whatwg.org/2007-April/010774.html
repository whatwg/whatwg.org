<PRE>Sorry for breaking into your realm, I just could not resist.
It seems that a recording that plays just once should have the loop-count
set to 0 (or left unspecified, of course).  This means that the loop-count
attribute cannot be used to specify that the recording should not play at
all - which hardly is what you would like to do anyway.  Using the name
loop-count is logical and viable under this semantic correction.

I agree.

To me, a loop-count of 1 means that it will play once and then loop
once. If a loop-count of 1 means that it only plays once, then it's
not really a loop-count. It's a play-count.

I myself like how the Windows Media 6.4 API does it. It has a
PlayCount  that specifies how many times to play, but 0 is a valid
value that means to repeat forever.
