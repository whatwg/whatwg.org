FWIW, the WRI requires AWPSs[*] that generate CSS to include a 'CSS zapper':
&lt;<A HREF="http://webrepair.org/02strategy/02certification/01requirements.php#req26">http://webrepair.org/02strategy/02certification/01requirements.php#req26</A>&gt;.

What would your proposal achieve that an author provided 'CSS zapper' does not?

I can think of a few downsides:
- The ideal presentation of something cannot be defined universally. What
works well in one browsing environment doesn't necessarily work well in
another.
- It takes ages to define and implement a spec. Leaving UAs no room to in the
mean time improve their built-in Style Sheets will slow down development.
- Built-in Style Sheets leave UAs room to distinguish themselves from their
competitors and can thus be an incentive to innovate, which can in turn make
all UAs grow towards more maturity.
- The user may well have changed the built-in Style Sheet to some other
default, so authors won't be able to rely on a certain default presentation
anyway.

Why should these downsides be acceptable?

Leaving aside whether the objective is desirable, I doubt this could even
ever result in the objective. Even if HTML would spec a default presentation
for everything, then still authors can not rely on every browser actually
implementing that. So they'd still need to use a 'CSS zapper'.

Frankly, I can't even imagine that we'd be able to agree on a default
presentation for everything. So I suspect that at best this could result in
an incomplete list of default styles, which would mean authors would have to
provide a 'CSS zapper'.

The fact that you already say &quot;within limits&quot; (what limits exactly?) and
&quot;informal&quot; (in the Subject) mean suggests you are aware of these issues.

That saying &quot;when scrolling a page to a fragment identifier, align the top of
the viewport with the target element's top border edge&quot;, seems to emphasize
my argument. This is a silly requirement. When the anchor is near the end of
the document, it would result in empty space below the document (what should
happen with bottom fixed positioned content?). I doubt users and Web
publishers would appreciate that and that UA authors would implement that.

What instead this should say is something like &quot;When taken to a fragment
identifier, UAs must clearly indicate the referenced point in the content to
the user&quot;. Because that *clarity* is what counts, not *how* that clarity is
provided. For example, a UA could indicate the target by hiliting it for a
couple of seconds, as iCab does. To me, as a user, that's a way more useful
and elegant solution. Similarly, it would make sense for the spec to say that
&quot;by default, occurences of title attributes must be clearly indicated to the
user&quot;, and &quot;occurences of LINK elements must be clearly indicated to the
user&quot;. But not *how* they should be indicated.

Who are we (as spec definers) to decide that x is the only correct behaviour
or presentation? And why should we want to stifle innovation by requiring
some specific presentation?
