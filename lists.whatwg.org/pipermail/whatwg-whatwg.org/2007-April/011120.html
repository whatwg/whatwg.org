<PRE>I'm a developer of a custom engine for interactive multimedia, and  
I've recently noticed the work WHATWG has been doing on adding  
&lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements to HTML. I'm very glad to see these  
being proposed for addition to HTML, because if they (and several  
other features) are done right, it means that there may be a chance  
for us to stop using a custom engine, and use an off-the-shelf HTML  
engine, putting our development focus on our authoring tools instead.  
My hope is that eventually, if these features get enough penetration,  
to put our content up on the web directly, rather than having to  
distribute the runtime software with it.

I've taken a look at the current specification for media elements,  
and on the whole, it looks like it would meet our needs. We are  
currently using VP3, and a combination of MP3 and Vorbis audio, for  
our codecs, so having Ogg Theora (based on VP3) and Ogg Vorbis as a  
baseline would be completely fine with us, and much preferable to the  
patent issues and licensing fees we'd need to deal with if we used  
MPEG4.

For the sort of content that we produce, cue points are incredibly  
important. Most of our content consists of a video or voiceover  
playing while bullet points appear, animations play, and graphics are  
revealed, all in sync with the video. We have a very simple system  
for doing cue points, that is extremely easy for the content authors  
to write and is robust for paused media, media that
