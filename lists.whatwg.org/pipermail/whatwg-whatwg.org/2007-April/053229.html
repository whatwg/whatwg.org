There are a lot of ways of doing this in a UI. There are a lot of cases (Maciej you seem to have most of them mentioned already) where the appropriate alt is null.

&gt;<i> I think it remains the case that for end-user generated content,

</I>
Years of work on accessibility, and a particular focus on authoring tools, suggests that while this is certainly true, There are lots of good ways to enable authors to include an alternate. One of the big frustrations I find with the web today is using assorted tools like wikis and blogsto edit content, and not being able to put useful content for alt where appropriate, and mark it explicitly blank for other cases.

Actually, given the relative distribution of disabilities and people, being able to put an image into content in the first place is probably more important than being able to put an alt to it - although the search engine case and various other things irrelevant to accessibility per se add to the value of alt.

But it should still be possible. This is not really rocket science, but stuff that people have been working on for decades. When I had my first job working in IT accessibility in 1983 it was already a fairly straightforward problem. That it still gets discussed today is not a very flattering reflection on us as a development community.
