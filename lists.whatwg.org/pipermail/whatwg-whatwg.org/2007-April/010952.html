Now that you say it, it's true that if the web application draws it 
once, drawing it again is as simple as putting the drawing code in a 
separate function and calling it again, with a different transform 
matrix set.

&gt;<i> and most implementations seem not to support it anyway.
</I>
Opera 9 seems to support it, though. And if the canvas was created by 
Apple, safari probably does too (Konqueror doesn't seem to have &lt;canvas&gt; 
implemented yet...?).

&gt;<i> So I would prefer to keep it simple and to see the spec reflect the
</I>&gt;<i> current reality over having both or incompatible changes in
</I>&gt;<i> implementations.
</I>
You mean replace the spec with the way it currently works in firefox?
Well, i would be OK with that, personnally, but maybe having both 
doesn't mean *significant* overhead?

Anyway it's possible the FF folks want to keep their way anyway (as a 
proprietary extension for now, let's say), for backwards compatibility.
Even if they implement the standard version too in a not-too-distant 
future as well, they will probably keep it. So why not try to find a way 
to have it compatible with the current spec, without removing anything?

Anyway FF is currently quite popular, so if webdesigners design their 
canvas stuff for it, assuming that &quot;it should work like that&quot;, other 
implementations will be somehow forced to implement it as well. It's not 
fair, but that's the way it has always been...
That is why i think keeping at least room for improvement in this area 
of the spec would be good. :)

Now what about my other suggestions? Would some of them OK as is, or 
could they be improved to better fit the needs? Am i asking too much 
somewhere?

PS: is it OK to post suggestions on the message board (at 
<A HREF="http://forums.whatwg.org/">http://forums.whatwg.org/</A>) instead of the mailing lists? Or maybe less 
people would read it? I didn't see any &quot;suggestions&quot; subcategory...
I ask that because i find message boards more &quot;user friendly&quot; than 
mailing lists. And i think probably people are more comfortable with MB 
than ML, so maybe we could get more interrested people to get involved 
by allowing suggestions there as well?
