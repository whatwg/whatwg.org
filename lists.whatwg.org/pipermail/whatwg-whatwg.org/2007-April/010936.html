<PRE>Hi Tyler,

I like the idea very much, for instance for having a copy of the CSS
spec on my laptop without the need of an Internet connection while
commuting....

- When I save a page with Safari, Firefox cannot read it.

- When saving stuff with Firefox, I have to deal with both, the HTML
file and the resource folder

- It would be easy to write a nice wget-like utility that creates a
single file.

- A zip based format is still usable for browsers that do not support
it, one would just needs to unpack the file.

Best regards,
Stefan Haustein

</I>&gt;<i> change the perception and application of HTML and I would really like to
</I>&gt;<i> keep the discussion alive.  In the previous thread, I proposed a
</I>&gt;<i> standard for archiving web sites into a single ZIP archive with a unique
</I>&gt;<i> file extension and although it didn't get any outright negative
</I>&gt;<i> feedback, it didn't drum up too much excitement either.  If you can bear
</I>&gt;<i> with me, I'd like to describe the idea again in a slightly different light.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Take for example, web-based presentations vs. PowerPoint from an average
</I>&gt;<i> user's point-of-view.  I can create an incredibly dynamic presentation
</I>&gt;<i> based on HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SVG, etc., but I can't easily share it
</I>&gt;<i> with anyone unless it is served (I can't easily send it to them).  On
</I>&gt;<i> the other hand, I can create an incredibly dynamic presentation using
</I>&gt;<i> PowerPoint, but I can't easily share it with anyone unless I send them
</I>&gt;<i> the file and they also have PowerPoint (I can't easily serve it).*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For another example, which relates to my modest experience, I've created
</I>&gt;<i> a simple Quotes/Sales/Invoices web app for a friend and have come across
</I>&gt;<i> similar issues trying to resolve the served file model with the local
</I>&gt;<i> file model.  Without going into too much detail, assume that there is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient reason why a file copy of the web page is needed (in this
</I>&gt;<i> case because my friend's customers can't use the app directly).  How
</I>&gt;<i> should the user get copies of web documents to be sent or saved to
</I>&gt;<i> disk?  Instead of describing all of the various options of saving it to
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of browser proprietary archive, sending HTML email, creating
</I>&gt;<i> an HTML-to-PDF converter or some other time-consuming non-user friendly
</I>&gt;<i> method, let's look at an ideal solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine this:  An HTML based document ZIP compressed into a single file
</I>&gt;<i> could be uploaded as is to the server.  Clicking on a link to the file
</I>&gt;<i> would probably download, decompress and open the file in the browser
</I>&gt;<i> seamlessly and, even better, right-clicking on the link instead and
</I>&gt;<i> choosing &quot;Download Linked File&quot; would download the same nice small
</I>&gt;<i> single file.**  Double clicking that file would open it in any browser
</I>&gt;<i> identically as to the served version.  The identical format and
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour of the web document and the file document presents the best
</I>&gt;<i> user experience.  Instead of saving a representation of the web
</I>&gt;<i> document, you are saving THE web document.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question is, why do we only think of HTML with respect to the web
</I>&gt;<i> and why are HTML-based documents constrained to being served?  This is
</I>&gt;<i> the meat of my argument.  Browsers have no issue opening a file URI, but
</I>&gt;<i> humans have an issue dealing with a directory of .html files versus,
</I>&gt;<i> say, a single .ppt file.  Humans will soon also have issues viewing and
</I>&gt;<i> serving ODF and OOXML files, I might add, but still won't have issues
</I>&gt;<i> viewing and serving HTML files.  After the little bit of discussion from
</I>&gt;<i> the first thread, I believe that the solution is indeed a near clone and
</I>&gt;<i> more complete version of the Widgets 1.0 specification (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAPF-REQ/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAPF-REQ/</A> ) as something different and as part of
</I>&gt;<i> HTML, specifying how to package entire web documents as zip compressed
</I>&gt;<i> archives using a unique file extension.  In reality, compared to all of
</I>&gt;<i> the other work being done on HTML, I believe this would be very simple
</I>&gt;<i> to specify and should be very simple to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please give this some thought.  I appreciate your comments.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * I could export an HTML version to be served, but I can't share both
</I>&gt;<i> ways with the same file and this means I have two versions of the same
</I>&gt;<i> presentation to work with.  Again, the average user (my mom) isn't going
</I>&gt;<i> to be serving files created on their desktop any time too soon, since
</I>&gt;<i> she has just barely grasped email attachments.
