What I mean is that unlike the case for other browser vendors, it  
won't cost us anything in patent license fees.

</I>&gt;<i> If you are concerned about submarine patents, I suggest that &quot;not

</I>
Obviously there is a tradeoff. Video codecs are a much more patent- 
prone area than many other areas of software.

&gt;&gt;<i> - They are technically superior to Ogg (seekable container format,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significantly better bitrate for video)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - They are competitive with likely next-generation proprietary video
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formats
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll let others comment on this. But I would note that JPEG2000 is  
</I>&gt;<i> technically superior to JPEG, but hasn't been widely implemented  
</I>&gt;<i> due to patent issues.
</I>
And due to the fact that JPEG is already universally deployed and  
good enough for most uses.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They are an open ISO standard (patents notwithstanding)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They are widely available in hardware implementations which we  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can use in our Consumer Electronics devices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They have been chosen as a standard for 3G mobile devices, HD- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DVD, Blu-Ray, HDTV broadcast, etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of which ship in countable units, and (where applicable) don't  
</I>&gt;<i> run free software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reasons Mozilla would like Ogg + Theora + Vorbis to be the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferred codec stack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - All known patents are royalty-free, so no need to pay $5 million  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to MPEG-LA
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is not that it's $5 million, it's that the amount is  
</I>&gt;<i> unknown and unmeasurable. They have no &quot;fixed fee above a certain  
</I>&gt;<i> number of units&quot; licensing policy. And even if they did, a Mozilla  
</I>&gt;<i> license wouldn't cover other members of that community.
</I>
Actually, they do have a license cap, and I overestated it. See  
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mpegla.com/m4v/m4v-agreement.cfm">http://www.mpegla.com/m4v/m4v-agreement.cfm</A>&gt;. It's only $1 million  
for &quot;Decoders sold to end-users and/or as fully functioning for  
PCs.&quot; (This document could be out of date.)

It's not immediately clear to me that a Mozilla license would not  
cover redistribution, for instance the license fees paid by OS  
vendors generally cover redistribution when the OS is bundled with a  
PC. I think someone would have to look at the legal language of the  
agreement to see if it covers redistribution.

&gt;&gt;<i> - Implementation would clearly be freely redistributable by third  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parties (the situation might be unclear if only Mozilla paid for a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patent license)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - No demand for use fees for commercial distribution in this format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me add other reasons why Mozilla (for whom, again, I am not  
</I>&gt;<i> speaking) might want to specify Theora/Dirac:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - They have a strong commitment to interoperability
</I>
I don't think Theora (or Dirac) are inherently more interoperable  
than other codecs. There's only one implementation of each so far, so  
there's actually less proof of this than for other codecs.

&gt;<i> - They appreciate that there are a wide variety of distribution  
</I>&gt;<i> models;
</I>&gt;<i>   for browsers, and do not want to choose technologies which work only
</I>&gt;<i>   for some of those;
</I>
Unfortunately, Ogg does not work for some browsers either.

&gt;<i> - If they think a royalty-free patent policy for standards is a good
</I>&gt;<i>   idea in one place (the W3C) then they think it's a good idea
</I>&gt;<i>   everywhere.
</I>
The problem is that the main standards bodies for video (such as the  
ISO) do not have the same norms about RF vs. RAND patent licensing as  
the W3C.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We think your reasons are strong and worthy of respect. That is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why we are not trying to force our codec preference on you, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather propose to leave this issue open. We ask you to respect our  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons as well, rather than trying to force us to go along with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your codec preference.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think achieving broader interoperability will require us to find  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways around this impasse, rather than bludgeoning each other until  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one side caves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, just to be clear: you believe interoperability is best promoted  
</I>&gt;<i> by having no codec specified in the spec?
</I>
I think if the spec mandates a single codec, that part of the spec  
will be ignored by at least some parties.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One possibility would be an open API for codec plugins that will  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work in &lt;video&gt;/&lt;audio&gt;, then user availability of codecs is not  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly tied to browser choice and codecs can compete in the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> marketplace more freely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You and I both know that this would result in dominance for  
</I>&gt;<i> whatever codecs got shipped by default on major operating systems.  
</I>&gt;<i> Content producers will not choose codecs for 5 or 10% better  
</I>&gt;<i> quality or bitrate, they will choose them for user convenience -  
</I>&gt;<i> because if their site is harder to use than their competitors,  
</I>&gt;<i> they'll fail.
</I>
Isn't this basically admitting that Ogg Theora would fail in the  
market if not legislated in the spec? Still, I would not be so sure  
of your conclusion. The bitrate differences among current codecs have  
a range of 2x or 4x, not just 10%. Also, Mozilla supporting Ogg would  
probably carry more weight than Safari supporting Mac OS X, since  
default or not, it has greater overall use share.

&gt;<i> As codecs are binary components, the site wanting to use foo-codec  
</I>&gt;<i> would need to provide versions of it for every operating system  
</I>&gt;<i> they planned to support. For Linux, that would be rather  
</I>&gt;<i> complicated, to say the least. They might not even bother offering  
</I>&gt;<i> it for Mac, or Mac PPC. This would discriminate against operating  
</I>&gt;<i> systems with smaller market shares.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another possibility would be to get MPEG-LA to change licensing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terms somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure that any help Apple would be able to give in this area  
</I>&gt;<i> would be much appreciated. How do you suggest we begin?
</I>
One good first step might be for someone to obtain a copy of the  
existing license terms and determine how they would apply to a freely  
redistributable product.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet another possibility is that one codec stack will become so  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popular that all parties will feel compelled to implement it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> despite their reasons against.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You again assume that only recalcitrance prevents some parties  
</I>&gt;<i> implementing any particular codec stack. As I understand the  
</I>&gt;<i> situation, Firefox would have to stop being free software in order  
</I>&gt;<i> to ship an MPEG4 implementation.
</I>
I don't think that is true, but it would depend on the details of the  
MPEG-LA license agreement. Also, at most the MPEG4 implementation  
would not be free software, this would not have to affect the rest of  
Firefox.

Maciej
