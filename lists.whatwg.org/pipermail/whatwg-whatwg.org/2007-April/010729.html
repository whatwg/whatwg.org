Close. &quot;Unless Apple implements a codec which is implementable by the 
other browser vendors, they don't really have a commitment to 
interoperability&quot; would be about it. I didn't mean Theora specifically, 
although only two freely-implementable-in-free-software codecs have so 
far been suggested (Theora and Dirac).

Again, I deny this is inflammatory. You cannot say both &quot;we have a 
strong commitment to interoperability&quot; and &quot;we are only going to 
implement a codec which it is impossible for other browsers to ship&quot;. 
They are contradictory. One or the other has to give.

You may dispute the &quot;impossible&quot; - but if we were trying to mandate a 
standard which required a patent which was available only to free 
software, and we told you &quot;just make all of Safari open source&quot;, that 
would probably be a lesser level of impossibility than &quot;make Firefox 
closed source&quot; (which would be required to allow it to ship MPEG).

(Regular reminder: only speaking for myself.)

But you are right; this is an impasse, and there's not much point going 
on. Barring a miraculous change of heart from either the members of the 
MPEG-LA or from Apple, there will be no standard codec for &lt;video&gt; 
across all browsers and platforms. Pity the content authors (well, 
either them, or the users of minority platforms).
