Mozilla can also be compiled and distributed by third parties. E.g.
Debian distributes a slightly modified version of Firefox as &quot;Iceweasel&quot;
AFAIK. They wouldn't be covered by a license Mozilla buys.

</I>
There's a Theora spec which is freely distributable and implementable
over at <A HREF="http://theora.org/doc/Theora_I_spec.pdf">http://theora.org/doc/Theora_I_spec.pdf</A> . The implementation is
BSD licensed. That's what gives it high potential for interoperability
because you can either use the existing code or do a new implementation
on your own without needing any permission.


&gt;&gt;<i> - They appreciate that there are a wide variety of distribution models;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   for some of those;

</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, Ogg does not work for some browsers either.
</I>
Well, for text browsers or on platforms that don't have the processing
juice to decode it (then they couldn't decode MPEG4 whatever-part
either). I'd say that are platforms that usually don't even have feature
complete browsers anyway.


&gt;<i> Isn't this basically admitting that Ogg Theora would fail in the market
</I>&gt;<i> if not legislated in the spec? Still, I would not be so sure of your
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion. The bitrate differences among current codecs have a range of
</I>&gt;<i> 2x or 4x, not just 10%.
</I>
Actually I would be surprised if H.264 would have a &quot;2x or 4x&quot; bitrate
advantage at similiar quality over Theora. H.264 is more powerful and I
guess it is outperforming Theora by more than 10% on average, but I
don't expect miracles from any coding scheme (but I guess your &quot;2x or
4x&quot; numbers weren't coined towards Theora but towards the multitude of
codecs being out there in general - spanning from MPEG1 to H.264).

Currently most web video seems to be H.263 in the Flash Video container,
which is pretty lousy compared to all codecs discussed here.


&gt;<i> I don't think that is true, but it would depend on the details of the
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG-LA license agreement. Also, at most the MPEG4 implementation would
</I>&gt;<i> not be free software, this would not have to affect the rest of Firefox.
</I>

I think many people would find it absolutely unacceptable if a &quot;free
speech&quot; version of Firefox would miss proper support for a core feature
of the &quot;official&quot; mozilla.org binary (if the free and the official
version diverge at what content they can display something is serious
messed up).
