I've removed _blank from the list of valid values.

</I>
_new isn't supported in IE. I couldn't work out why Firefox supports it. 
I've not added it.

</I>
If people widely blocked _blank, then authors would start using the names 
anyway. So that doesn't really change anything in practice.

</I>
It would be interesting to hear the needs of these authors. Can anyone 
elaborate? We might well need to re-allow it in the end, I'm curious to 
hear why people use it.


&gt;<i> Would perhaps a spec conformance requirement that browsers should offer 
</I>&gt;<i> users a config option to opt out of windows being opened via target 
</I>&gt;<i> values be an alternative? It could avoid the seemingly unwin'able 
</I>&gt;<i> argument with authors who insist on doing this, and give users the final 
</I>&gt;<i> say
</I>
This doesn't have to be in the spec, since it isn't required for interop.

Indeed.
