If these are meant for script-private data, I think the same ad-hoc  
collision avoidance that works for the script libraries themselves  
might work.

</I>
getAttributeNS is definitely not a good choice for HTML, because no  
current HTML implementation will recognize namespace declarations in  
HTML and allow use of the relevant namespace URI with getAttributeNS.

Passing a QName to getAttribute might be workable but would require a  
change to at least some XHTML implementations so that scripts can  
work the same in HTML and XHTML. However, this ends up giving  
semantic weight to the namespace prefix, not the namespace URI, and  
so has no better collision avoidance in practice than an ad-hoc  
prefixing mechanism.

I will also add that the details XML namespaces can be quite  
difficult to understand, even for experts, so I would be hesitant to  
spread their use to HTML.

Maciej
