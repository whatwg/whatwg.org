I'd guess that'd be nearly as convenient for the end user. He encounters
content encoded in whatever format, a dialog pops up &quot;I need to download
a codec, sit back and enjoy&quot; and few seconds later the Apple customer
can access the content in whatever format.

I think as we're talking of web video optional codec downloads should
just work as well as hardwiring things. If Apple is willing to accept a
third party component to enable playback of whatever &quot;base format&quot; Opera
and Mozilla are going to use that'd be a good solution for the
interoperability issues. Seeing that Apple accepted the VP3 component in
the past to make Apple customers happy (business reason) I have hopes
that a similiar solution can be found to make sure Apple users can
access web content even if it doesn't happen to use a format QuickTime
supports out-of-the-box. In case of Microsoft I guess they'd prefer
making their user's life difficult over offering non-Microsoft formats
with their download service (did that ever deliver a codec I found
useful? No.), but seeing that
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/resources/components.html">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/resources/components.html</A> lists coding
technologies I never heard of I am optimistic that things can be worked out.

This is vastly off-topic, but is there a formalized way for 3rd parties
to register their qt components and have them in the download service?
If e.g. Xiph.org could negotiate a deal of that sort I'd say the whole
codec discussion would loose its significance (and work can go on the
core functionality of &lt;video&gt;) as no matter what codecs Apple chooses to
deliver by default things would be &quot;interoperable enough&quot; with a simple
&quot;ok, download the codec&quot; from the Safari user.

</I>
Yes. Business reasons would be the driving force behind that.
