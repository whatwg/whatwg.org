The problem is that 'media-loop-count' with a value of 1, as defined, 
doesn't have anything to do with looping... play-count is much more 
descriptive of its actual purpose, IMO, despite not containing 'loop' in 
the name.  The others should definitely stay &quot;loop-&quot;, though.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The descriptions for 'media-loop-start-time' and 'media-loop-end- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time' don't match; start-time says &quot;sets the time at which the media 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> item begins playing after looping&quot;, and end-time says &quot;sets the time 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at which the media item loops for the second and subsequent repetitions&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would suggest that start-time says &quot;sets the time index at which the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> media item starts playing for the second and subsequent repetitions&quot;, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and that end-time says &quot;sets the time index at which the media item 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ends playing for the second and subsequent repetitions.&quot;  The language 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for end-time is still a little awkward, since &quot;ends playing&quot; could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imply that it simply stops playing (and does not loop), but it's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearer than before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the language might have ended up actually defining it wrong. The 
</I>&gt;<i> intent of 'media-loop-end-time' is that this is the point where you end 
</I>&gt;<i> where repeating, but on the last iteration you go all the way to 
</I>&gt;<i> 'media-end-time'. So if 'media-loop-count' has a value of 3, the three 
</I>&gt;<i> repetitions would go as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
Hmmm.  I see how that would be useful, ok.  So if I just wanted to loop 
the first 5 seconds of a video clip, I would just set media-start-time 
to 0s and media-end-time to 5s, and the count to infinite, right? 
Clarifying this (perhaps with some examples) would be good.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. 'media-timing' I would get rid of completely; while a shorthand 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be useful, I don't think that media-timing as specified really 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works. Shorthands for properties such as 'background' are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understandable on their own; 'media-timing: playing 0s -0.5s 2 2s -4s 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1' is very opaque.    If it's still desirable, I would remove the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting of start/end times and change the volume shorthand to only 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accept the symbolic names; e.g. 'media-timing: playing high 4;'... but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that removing the shorthand entirely would be preferable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll reply in more detail about media-timing in a later message.
</I>
Sounds good.
