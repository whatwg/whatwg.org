</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm doing something similar for the DOM Range tests I'm writing. &#160;For

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://html5.org/specs/dom-range.html">http://html5.org/specs/dom-range.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should be much easier to implement, since it's written

</I>&gt;<i> the spec line-by-line). &#160;It also has more features and more closely
</I>&gt;<i> matches how browsers actually work, and it defines Selection too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of my spec-related code (tests, implementations, etc.) is in the
</I>&gt;<i> public domain.
</I>
The core stuff for my library (DOM Range and Selection for all
browsers, including IE &lt; 9) is already done. The Range part follows
the DOM Level 2 Range spec (apart from the parts about the effect of
DOM mutation on existing Ranges, which I didn't implement), since your
new algorithm-based spec didn't exist at the time (August-October
2010). The Selection part imitates what I considered the most useful
common ground between Mozilla and WebKit Selection objects with only a
little influence from the Selection section in the HTML5 spec (which
is where it was at the time) since it had a number of issues that I
discovered and raised bugs for while writing the selection code
(backwards selections, extend(), toString()).

I have been following your progress fairly carefully and am aware of
the extra features in your spec, some of which may have originated
from my requests. There is a lot of useful stuff in your code, spec
and tests that I intend to look at to verify and likely improve my
code. Thanks for all your work.
