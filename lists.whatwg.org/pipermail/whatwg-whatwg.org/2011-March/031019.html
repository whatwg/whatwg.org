And it continues to work when they implement the proposed spec, yes.

Right.

&gt;<i> Fixing the issue results in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;style scoped&gt;.foo { color: red; }&lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>
The correct fix for this issue is to put this &lt;style&gt; in the &lt;head&gt;, 
isn't it?  Why would would you fix it by adding @scoped?

&gt;<i> It seems like the scoped attribute should be optional when&lt;style&gt;  is used as flow content
</I>
What are the use cases for wanting this?

&gt;<i> while also ensuring that the spec reflects current browser behavior.
</I>
The part of the spec that defines what browsers are supposed to do 
already reflects current browser behavior.

There's a difference between specifying what browsers should do and 
deciding what markup is valid.  For example, if we consider this markup:


   &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bold and italic&lt;/b&gt; just italic&lt;/i&gt;

then the spec defines that browsers should render it so that it is 
self-describing (which they do).  But the markup is nevertheless invalid.

&gt;<i> Pleasant side effect is that everyone with&lt;style&gt;  as flow content will have on less validation error to worry about.
</I>
That would be one reason to allow &lt;style&gt; as flow content: so that 
legacy pages that use it thus don't need to change anything.

However such pages don't care about validating anyway, since in HTML4 
&lt;style&gt; is _only_ valid as a child of &lt;head&gt;.  So why are we worrying 
about making it easier for them to validate?

Are there any other reasons to allow &lt;style&gt; as flow content?  That is, 
are there good use cases for it?
