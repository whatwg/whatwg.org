I agree.

Usuario, in the example you've given the newly proposed version of the
&lt;body&gt; tag only encloses content that isn't otherwise encompassed by the
&lt;header&gt; or &lt;footer&gt;, meaning it serves no purpose to distinguish it
from the header and footer because those specific tags are already doing
that.

The body tag holds all the content that is presented to the user. After
a long look at a wide variety of websites, the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;
(among other) tags were added to mark those areas of a website out
against the actual content. This basically means that anything that
isn't a header or a footer is main content. Of course there are things
like &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; to further break things down.

Think about it a bit like a word-processed document for a moment. In
that, all content is deemed to be main content apart from page headers
and footers which can be added in. Within the content you can mark up
various text as a header or otherwise. A web page isn't too dissimilar,
although it allows for far more semantic meaning to be given to content.
What you must remember is that the new HTML5 tags aren't just for easier
styling but to allow better parsing by non-humans, be it a search
engine, screen reader or some content archiver.
