Our experience with WebSockets indicates that masking is still
important even when communicating between the browser and an
attacker-controlled server.  The problem is that intermediaries
attempt to &quot;sniff&quot; the protocol by looking at the bytes on the wire.
For example, one could easily imagine an intermediary attempting to do
&quot;helpful&quot; things to transiting UDP packets that look like DNS requests
or responses.  Rather than play whack-a-mole with these possibilities,
we're better off building a protocol that's secure by design.

What makes you so confident that intermediaries aren't listening to
(and possibly modifying) UDP packets?  The entire point of ICE is to
trick intermediaries (e.g., home routers) into modifying their state
in certain ways.  It seems entirely likely that the state of those
intermediaries will further effected by subsequent UDP traffic.

Your assumptions are incorrect.  HTTP has caused a long history of
security problems in this regard.  Opening up UDP attack surface is
bad news bears.
