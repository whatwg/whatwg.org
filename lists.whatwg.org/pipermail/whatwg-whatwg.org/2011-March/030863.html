I think we should do it.  Being able to play with screen pixels
directly is useful functionality.


&gt;<i> I know there are some security considerations (for example listed in the
</I>&gt;<i> source of drawWindow):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// We can't allow web apps to call this until we fix at least the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// following potential security issues:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// -- rendering cross-domain IFRAMEs and then extracting the results
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// -- rendering the user's theme and then extracting the results
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// -- rendering native anonymous content (e.g., file input paths;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// scrollbars should be allowed)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm no security expert, but it seems to me there's an easy way to at least

</I>&gt;<i> it's simple and would block you from reading any of the pixels back which

</I>
I suspect it wouldn't be too difficult to do this better - we can know
ahead of time whether the window contains any cross-origin resources
that aren't cleared by CORS.


&gt;<i> I'm doing a WebGL demo, so the use-case I have for this would be to render a
</I>&gt;<i> same-origin page to a canvas and smack that on a monitor in the 3d-world.
</I>&gt;<i> Intercept mouse clicks, transform them into 2d and passing them on would of
</I>&gt;<i> course be neat as well and probably opens up the use-cases you could dream
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'm well aware its a tad unconventional, but perhaps someone has a
</I>&gt;<i> better idea of how something like this could be accomplished... i.e. via SVG
</I>&gt;<i> and foreignObject or punching a hole in the canvas and applying a transform
</I>&gt;<i> etc. I'd like to hear your thoughts.
</I>
I think we should be closing the &lt;svg&gt;/&lt;foreignObject&gt; hole, not
expanding it as the primary way to smuggle in drawWindow
functionality.  ^_^
