which HTML inherits from.
There's a bulk of APIs under the &quot;webapps&quot; group, covering much of the rest.

I think that HTML spec is primarily a format spec, not an API spec.

&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, contenteditable is less accessible to users than it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be. I'd like to see that addressed.
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on how it is less accessible than it should be?
</I>I can't. But I can give some examples of shortcomings, as the Google 
word processor
and Microsoft's editor are both quite short of coming anything near 
desktop word processing.

The CK editor is certainly still a great example of pushing it as far as 
they can.

My understanding is that rich text editing is really handed off to the 
UA (reading that from the ARIA
spec under the Rich Text editor control), and that it's usability is a 
UA issue, not a scripting/format issue.
