That goal is incompatible with legacy interoperability. It is also 
probably unnecessary in the case where we use real encryption (DTLS / 
DTLS-SRTP) for the media flows.

WebSockets is a special case in that it is trying to look a bit like 
HTTP at the start *and* is TCP/80. The number of cases where UDP 
datagrams are damaged is much smaller and probably much less important 
to solve.

</I>
What's the threat model here? Are we worried that browsers will send UDP 
flows to endpoints that don't want them (which I claim the STUN 
connectivity test is sufficient to prevent) or are we worried that 
browsers will send UDP flows to endpoints that do want them but that 
something in the middle will break this? We already know that a 
UDP-blocking firewall falls into the second category, so this will 
happen some of the time no matter how much we might not want it to.

</I>&gt;<i> in certain ways.  It seems entirely likely that the state of those

</I>
Of course... for starters, the intermediaries will likely reset their 
UDP mapping timers as traffic comes by.

</I>
Yes, it is, and that is exactly why I have proposed since the beginning 
that we ensure that browsers cannot send UDP datagrams (beyond 
rate-limited STUN connectivity checks whose content isn't controlled by 
the Javascript) to endpoints that don't agree to receive them.

I haven't seen any demonstration that this isn't sufficient to prevent 
the browser from being used as an attack vector, and the only safer 
thing to do is to not add this capability at all.
