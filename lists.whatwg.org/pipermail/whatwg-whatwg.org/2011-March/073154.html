<PRE>I'm currently 60-75% complete landing the patches for image paste support in
Chrome. I've chosen to expose image/png instead of a raw bitmap through
event.clipboardData.items in Chrome as a Blob. DataTransferItem::getAsFile()
is currently specced to return a File; in my local changes, it secretly
returns a Blob instead. I think it may make sense to rename it to
getAsBlob() and change the corresponding add() method in DataTransferItems
to take a Blob. I think these basic changes should support the use case you
want if it gets more widely implemented.

&gt;<i> I would like to be able to paste images from the system clipboard into
</I>&gt;<i> web apps.  E.g. an annotated screengrab right into the bug tracker, a
</I>&gt;<i> pic into emails, an image from twitpic into a blog CMS's post screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Apologies if this has been discussed recently and conclusions made.
</I>&gt;<i> I searched the archives and couldn't find anything.  Also, this email
</I>&gt;<i> recapitulates a lot of stuff that will be familiar to participants in
</I>&gt;<i> this list, but I'm hoping that by posting a summary of the state of
</I>&gt;<i> affairs and then hopefully having errors/misconceptions pointed out,
</I>&gt;<i> it will serve as good archive fodder for future people like me.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is of course a special case of richer interaction with the system
</I>&gt;<i> clipboard, but I think its a very special case, for two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>  - The general case of richer paste is fraught with peril: what the is
</I>&gt;<i> your webapp supposed to do with pointers to various system data
</I>&gt;<i> structures?
</I>&gt;<i>  - The second-most common type of data, after text, manipulated on the
</I>&gt;<i> web is images.  They are a huge part of people's interaction with the
</I>&gt;<i> browser.  People move tons of images all over the web all the time,
</I>&gt;<i> and having to bounce off the local filesystem for everything is a
</I>&gt;<i> pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, there are effectively two intertwined APIs in the spec that
</I>&gt;<i> relate to being able to paste images:
</I>&gt;<i>  - The Old API, Microsoft style, which includes
</I>&gt;<i> DataTransfer.getData(format)
</I>&gt;<i>  - The New API: DataTransferItems, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -=The Old API=-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the Old API, the spec reads as if it could be possible to get
</I>&gt;<i> this data, should the browser feel like giving it to you.  There's
</I>&gt;<i> nothing that specifically limits what data the UA can give you, and it
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like you should be able to ask for whatever the UA tells you it
</I>&gt;<i> has: <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#dom-datatransfer-getdata">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#dom-datatransfer-getdata</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (note: there seems to a small typo in the current Editor's Draft: the
</I>&gt;<i> getData() method only takes 'format', not a second parameter called
</I>&gt;<i> 'data', right?  That's what the summary tables above say.  In either
</I>&gt;<i> case, these should probably agree).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a range in what the browsers return for types.  In Safari
</I>&gt;<i> (r80833), having a png on the clipboard shows you:
</I>&gt;<i>  - com.apple.pasteboard.promised-file-url
</I>&gt;<i>  - public.tiff
</I>&gt;<i>  - NSPromiseContentsPboardType
</I>&gt;<i>  - com.apple.webarchive
</I>&gt;<i>  - public.utf8-plain-text
</I>&gt;<i>  - dyn.ah62d4rv4gu8yc6durvwwaznwmuuha2pxsvw0e55bsmwca7d3sbwu
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/uri-list
</I>&gt;<i>  - Apple files promise pasteboard type
</I>&gt;<i>  - application/x-webarchive
</I>&gt;<i>  - dyn.ah62d4rv4gu8y6y4usm1044pxqzb085xyqz1hk64uqm10c6xenv61a3k
</I>&gt;<i>  - dyn.ah62d4rv4gu8zs3pcnzme2641rf4guzdmsv0gn64uqm10c6xenv61a3k
</I>&gt;<i>  - WebURLsWithTitlesPboardType
</I>&gt;<i>  -
</I>&gt;<i> dyn.ah62d4rv4gu8yc6durvwwa3xmrvw1gkdusm1044pxqyuha2pxsvw0e55bsmwca7d3sbwu
</I>&gt;<i>  - CorePasteboardFlavorType 0x75726C6E
</I>&gt;<i>  - CorePasteboardFlavorType 0x75726C20
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/plain
</I>&gt;<i>  - public.url-name
</I>&gt;<i>  - NeXT RTFD pasteboard type
</I>&gt;<i>  - public.url
</I>&gt;<i>  - com.apple.flat-rtfd
</I>&gt;<i>  - com.apple.pasteboard.promised-file-content-type
</I>&gt;<i>  - image/tiff
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whereas the Chrome I have (10.0.648.133) shows me:
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/html
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/uri-list
</I>&gt;<i>  - url
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox (3.6.15):
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/x-moz-url
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/x-moz-url-data
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/x-moz-url-desc
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/uri-list
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/_moz_htmlcontext
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/_moz_htmlinfo
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/html
</I>&gt;<i>  - text/plain
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this contravenes the spec, except that for all of those
</I>&gt;<i> rich types in Safari, you don't actually get anything when you ask for
</I>&gt;<i> it.  The spec doesn't really mandate anything that you have to do with
</I>&gt;<i> any specific types of data on the clipboard, which especially makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense when considering data that originates outside the browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has one interesting implication though for data that originates
</I>&gt;<i> inside the browser: drag/drop or paste with images loaded from data
</I>&gt;<i> URIs.  Currently, the clipboard behavior of these is interesting but
</I>&gt;<i> varies:
</I>&gt;<i>  - Chrome will return an img tag with the data uri intact, with the
</I>&gt;<i> Base64-encoded data for type &quot;text/html&quot; (preceded by a meta tag
</I>&gt;<i> telling you you're getting html)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Firefox does pretty much the same thing, minus the meta tag
</I>&gt;<i>  - Safari doesn't present a &quot;text/html&quot; type in this case.  However,
</I>&gt;<i> it does provide a &quot;text/plain&quot;, which contains *just* the data uri
</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this situation isn't preventing anyone from doing anything, as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I can tell, but would it be crazy to try to normalize this in
</I>&gt;<i> the HTML5 spec? Decide whether a dragged/pasted data uri-backed &lt;img&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> counts as HTML or or text or neither, and when it does, what the HTML
</I>&gt;<i> representation is appropriate to hand back?  For what its worth, FF
</I>&gt;<i> and Chrome both return the plain data uri Safari-style if you ask for
</I>&gt;<i> text/uri-list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, there is little interest in expanding the Old
</I>&gt;<i> API, since its an acknowledged hack-pile, but just to enumerate
</I>&gt;<i> options, I think it would be cool if there was a way to get image data
</I>&gt;<i> from here.  The obvious ways to do this would be:
</I>&gt;<i>  - actually expose mime types like image/tiff and return a String of 1s and
</I>&gt;<i> 0s.
</I>&gt;<i>  - actually expose mime types, but when you ask for a binary one, you
</I>&gt;<i> get a Blob.
</I>&gt;<i>  - expose base64-encoded mime types.  I realize it seems a bit weird
</I>&gt;<i> to push base64 encoding into the clipboard logic, but there are
</I>&gt;<i> already several places in the current spec and implementation where
</I>&gt;<i> base64-encoded binary data is given special treatment which provides
</I>&gt;<i> both (a) precedent and (b) use cases.  For example, many of the
</I>&gt;<i> browsers can load resources from base64-encoded data uri's.  The
</I>&gt;<i> Canvas object exposes a getDataUrl() method that returns a
</I>&gt;<i> base64-encoded png of the Canvas.  Having base64 data quick 'n' easy
</I>&gt;<i> to get here would make it easy to push this data around in useful ways
</I>&gt;<i> within apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that no one wants to either add this to the current
</I>&gt;<i> implementations, even to accept patches that implement this behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> and that no one will want to add anything new to this part of the
</I>&gt;<i> spec, given the focus on the newer area.  Also, requiring support for
</I>&gt;<i> handling of specific binary formats seems to go against HTML's
</I>&gt;<i> heritage.  So while spec-wise, there's nothing to keep implementors
</I>&gt;<i> from adding application base64 versions of various image types to this
</I>&gt;<i> API, and returning same from getData(), they probably won't, and it
</I>&gt;<i> seems...unlikely to me that the spec will all of the sudden require
</I>&gt;<i> say four image types here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, moving on...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -=The New API=-
</I>&gt;<i> By the New API, I'm referring to the items member of DataTransfer,
</I>&gt;<i> DataTransferItems, and DataTransferItem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Briefly, it looks to me like the use cases were more thought out here
</I>&gt;<i> for interacting with system drag-drop than with copy-paste.  Excuse me
</I>&gt;<i> if that isn't the case, and the idea of richer copy-paste was just
</I>&gt;<i> considered to be out of scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These features aren't supported by any of the shipping browsers I
</I>&gt;<i> looked at, but it looks like someone has started implementing them in
</I>&gt;<i> Chromium, there's talk on Firefox's list, and I'm not sure about
</I>&gt;<i> Safari/don't know how/if Chromium patches work their way up and down
</I>&gt;<i> into WebKit.  I haven't looked at the other browsers yet.  The point
</I>&gt;<i> is, I haven't actually been able to play with this, so I'm just going
</I>&gt;<i> by the spec here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to the spec, with this API implemented, there will be no way
</I>&gt;<i> to copy an image from a tab, and paste it into another tab (assuming
</I>&gt;<i> the browser itself doesn't do something crazy like...bounce the system
</I>&gt;<i> clipboard to a temporary file on paste and give you the filename
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere).  The DataTransferItem can be of two kinds: a string, or a
</I>&gt;<i> string referring to a file, so this lets you drag String-y data off
</I>&gt;<i> your system and into a tab, and it also lets you presumably use
</I>&gt;<i> Drag/Drop instead of the system's file browser to attach files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any chance of adding something like a getBlob() method here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My initial thought about the trade-offs here vs. something like adding
</I>&gt;<i> Base64'd binary types to the old DataTranfer.getData() is that its
</I>&gt;<i> more in keeping with the overall direction of HTML5, but also more
</I>&gt;<i> wrapped up in additional new APIs and less easy to immediately use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, given the way system clipboards generally work, its pretty
</I>&gt;<i> easy to imagine how you could:
</I>&gt;<i>  - Map from certain system types to MIME types (or in some cases you
</I>&gt;<i> already have MIME types handy, and they don't necessarily have to be
</I>&gt;<i> in the spec)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Add more types to DataTransferItems to show these (again, don't
</I>&gt;<i> HAVE to be in spec)
</I>&gt;<i>  - have a DataTransferItems.getBlob(format) that returns a Blob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For small objects you could handle this immediately or fail with a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;too big&quot; error, and with Web Workers you could handle larger pastes
</I>&gt;<i> without blocking the UI thread the entire time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, sorry if this was discussed in the current cycle and punted on
</I>&gt;<i> already, maybe I'm using the wrong search terms. Any thoughts about
</I>&gt;<i> changing the spec so that it becomes possible to paste images?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> jeb.
