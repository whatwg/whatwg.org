To some extent that's up to the browser. It logs you in, it can offer the 
ability to log you out.

What features does it have that other mechanisms do not?


&gt;<i> The only problem is that you can't clear credentials when a session is

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I would imagine such a API existing out of just two

</I>&gt;<i> started all credentials cached for HTTP authentication and everything

</I>&gt;<i> button that actually works. Currently it is possible the clean out 
</I>&gt;<i> sessionStorage and destroy cookies but not to clear cached credentials 
</I>&gt;<i> for HTTP authentication.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly the start function could also accept a path argument to specify 
</I>&gt;<i> just a sub area of the origin on which the session is valid. This would 
</I>&gt;<i> allow more fine-grained control. Please note that the session would be

</I>&gt;<i> credentials belonging to the current session should not be limited to 
</I>&gt;<i> just credentials cached for the top-browser context origin but all 
</I>&gt;<i> credentials cached. This should also be the case for sessionStorage and 
</I>&gt;<i> cookies without expiration specified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for backwards-compatibility since the feature requires a developer to

This is an interesting idea. I recommend following the steps described 
here to see if it can get traction:
