We could just add flags to the options string like this:

&quot;video;view=user, audio&quot; or &quot;video;view=environment, audio&quot;

It's worth pointing out that The HTML Media Capture draft from the DAP 
WG uses the terms &quot;camera&quot; and &quot;camcorder&quot; for this purpose, but I find 
these terms to be very ambiguous and inappropriate, and so we should not 
use them here.

</I>
I'm not entirely clear about what the use cases are for knowing if the 
camera is either user-view or environment-view.  It seems the more 
useful information to know is the orientation of the camera.  If the 
user switches cameras, that could also be handled by firing orientation 
events.

</I>
This could work.  But it would make more sense if there were an object 
representing the device itself, as in Rich's proposal, and for the 
events to be fired on that object instead of the stream.

</I>
This is basically what Philip and I were discussing in the other thread 
yesterday, where we avoid the unnecessary overhead of creating a magic 
URL, and instead just assign the object directly to the src property. 
This lets the implementation handle all the magic transparently in the 
background, without bothering to expose a URLs string to the author.

This is what we had implemented in our experimental implementation of 
the &lt;device&gt; element, and now getUserMedia.

i.e.

&lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var v = document.querySelector(&quot;video&quot;);
navigator.getUserMedia(&quot;video&quot;, function(stream) {
   v.src = stream;
   v.play();
});
&lt;/script&gt;

The getter for v.src then returns &quot;about:streamurl&quot;.

My understanding is that we don't really want to have to implement the 
create/revokeObjectURL() methods for this.

</I>
This suggests that there would be a separate property available for the 
microphone, and any other input device.  This differs from the existing 
spec, which allowed a single stream to represent both audio and video.

It may still be useful to have events for this, if the event object had 
a property that indicated which type of stream it applied to, or if 
there were separate objects for both the audio and video streams.
