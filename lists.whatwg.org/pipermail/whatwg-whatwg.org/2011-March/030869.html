</I>
Except that I don't think this is how any implementation actually
works. Nor do I have any desire to write the implementation this way
since it means duplicating a lot of code. I'd have to add code which
implemented attribute behavior both in some special code path
triggered during element creation, as well as code to react to
attribute changes triggered by attribute changes in
setAttribute/removeAttribute.

So far this hasn't been needed and the parsing code basically just
calls setAttribute. Unless there are really good reasons to change
this I'd like to avoid it. So far I haven't heard of any such reasons.

</I>
You're expecting several operations to happen at the same time. We
could certainly manually insert the attributes and their value into
the datastructure inside the element which stores the attribute
name/value pairs. However at some point we need to update all of the
state that these values drive. Things like sticking elements into
id-hashes, storing the calculated type of an input, calculating the
effective URI of an image, etc. This involves several separate pieces
of state and so can't happen &quot;all at the same time&quot;.

</I>
I wouldn't build a parser on the raw DOM API either. But mostly for
performance reasons since we have to do a lot more checks on data that
comes from untrusted script (things like prevent ancestor cycles etc).
But I'd also strongly want to share most of the code path between the
API that the DOM uses and that the parser uses. Not doing that is
going to lead to a lot more bloat and a lot more bugs.

Gecko doesn't exhibit this behavior and I don't know of any sites that
doesn't work in Gecko because of this.
