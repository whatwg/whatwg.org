</I>OK, so you're not advocating masking in order to protect against an 
attacker, you're advocating masking in order to protect well-meaning 
intermediateware from its own bogus packet interpretations.
I usually don't call that security, I call it resilience.

I think we should keep those discussions somewhat separate, because 
stuff added to serve one purpose rarely is a good fit for the other. (I 
have a long list of things that I dislike because they are used for 
multiple purposes and serve neither function well ... starting with the 
source address of an IP packet .. but I digress.)

Or I may misunderstand the scenario you're talking about.

</I>We know they are. Some of them are doing totally broken things (for 
instance looking for the bit pattern corresponding to 10.0.0.1 and 
changing it to a NAT's external address without regard for context - 
which is the excuse for some of the more baroque constructs of the STUN 
protocol).

There is also rumoured to be devices that look for packet streams with 
regular 20 ms spacing, and block them in an attempt to prevent people 
from using nonapproved VoIP devices.

At some point, we have to declare that there is breakage introduced by 
other people's incompetence where we accept that failure will result a 
certain percentage of the time until those devices are replaced. I 
believe that the STUN XOR-ing of addresses (RFC 5389 section 15.2) was 
an example of going too far (we should have detected the brokenness and 
signalled it rather than routing around it; we traded a clear &quot;doesn't 
work because of this kind of bogosity&quot; function for a &quot;will corrupt a 
known percentage of your traffic&quot; function.... but I digress).
