</I>
The concern is still protecting against attacks: an attacker using the API
to attack this sort of broken software.

Remember that in all encryption methods discussed so far, packets always
look &quot;masked&quot; to an outside observer (except, in some cases, for a few
header bytes like a sequence number).  The difference is whether it's
possible for an active attacker to construct almost-arbitrary packet
contents: that's possible when using a predictable sequence number as a CTR
counter and no random per-packet nonce.

&gt;<i> I usually don't call that security, I call it resilience.
</I>
It's expensive resilience: 16 bytes of added overhead for every datagram.
 That's overhead added to every PeerConnection datagram protocol, in order
to help hide problems in something catastrophically broken and inherently
insecure.

&gt;<i> I think we should keep those discussions somewhat separate, because stuff
</I>&gt;<i> added to serve one purpose rarely is a good fit for the other. (I have a
</I>&gt;<i> long list of things that I dislike because they are used for multiple
</I>&gt;<i> purposes and serve neither function well ... starting with the source
</I>&gt;<i> address of an IP packet .. but I digress.)
</I>
The discussion hasn't changed--splitting threads just tends to fragment the
discussion.
