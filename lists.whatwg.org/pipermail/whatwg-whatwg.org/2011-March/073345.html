Hmm, I see.  I was assuming that insertBefore() would just atomically
change the parent from the new one to the old one.  Looking more
closely at DOM Core, I see it's specced the way you describe it
(although nothing says when the mutation events fire).  That's
certainly a problem for my plan.  It would be possible to work around
it by requiring that insertBefore() and similar methods do special
magic for Ranges independent of the actual DOM mutations done,
however.  That already has to happen for
insertData()/deleteData()/appendData(), right?  All browsers treat
those differently from just setting the data to the equivalent string.

&gt;<i> Now if we dropped support for mutation events and userdata handlers
</I>&gt;<i> first.....
</I>
Is that feasible?  I get the impression implementers would all love
it, but somehow they haven't done it yet.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;// Mutate the child storage of A to put B in the child list; notify

</I>&gt;<i> Both the removeChild call and the mutation of A's child list notify mutation

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Boris
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. &#160;I suspect that actual interoperability for the edge cases of this

</I>
DOM Core says it's supposed to be basically

    if (B.ownerDocument != A.ownerDocument) {
        A.ownerDocument.adoptNode(B);
    }

    // Insert into the children
&lt;<A HREF="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#dom-node-insertbefore">http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#dom-node-insertbefore</A>&gt;

where adoptNode() removes the node from its parent before changing the
ownerDocument.  This seems to be how both IE, Gecko and Opera actually
behave -- moving a node from one document to another has the
ownerDocument equal to the old document on DOMNodeRemoved, and the new
document on DOMNodeInserted.  (WebKit throws if you do insertBefore()
cross-document, and I can't get it to fire any DOM mutation events
even if it's same-document.)  When I thoughtlessly mutated the DOM
from the event handler, though, I definitely hit a lack of interop.


Anyway, then what does Gecko do for execCommand()?  Does that just
have special-case logic to adjust the selection to fit the new DOM?
It would be nice if we could eliminate that in a clean way, from both
the specs and implementations.
