</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> able to send data at all except to a peer that agreed to receive data on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> port.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's possible that ICE doesn't actually negotiate this securely, since the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> negotiation is secure under these circumstances?  Or do you think it doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> matter?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The STUN server is used to obtain your own &quot;public&quot; IP address, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constructing candidate lists.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The STUN server is not involved in the ICE handshake.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you're using TURN relays, the TURN server is, of course, involved (it's the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relay), but since you're trusting it to be a relay, I don't think there's an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional threat from the fact that it sees the ICE handshake.
</I>&gt;<i> Who is the &quot;you&quot; who is doing the trusting in this scenario?
</I>The browser, or rather: The piece of the browser that ensures that the 
ICE handshake is complete before sending a data packet to the UDP port.
&gt;<i> There are a number of potential attacks here, and a number of players who
</I>&gt;<i> are (or should be) all potentially mutually distrustful -- the user, the
</I>&gt;<i> browser, the origin of the page, the TURN server, the remote peer, and any
</I>&gt;<i> potentially victim host that has no intent in being a party to any
</I>&gt;<i> communication. I haven't yet studied the threat model discussed in this
</I>&gt;<i> thread in depth, but if the threat we're talking about is a cross-protocol
</I>&gt;<i> attack on the potential victim host, then the TURN server can be actively
</I>&gt;<i> hostile and is not trusted by the browser, and the remote peer can be
</I>&gt;<i> actively hostile and is also not trusted by the browser. Obviously it's
</I>&gt;<i> not a problem if the TURN server is hostile and an attack is bounced off
</I>&gt;<i> the TURN server, since the TURN server could just mount the attack
</I>&gt;<i> directly. The concern is presumably about whether the TURN server, the
</I>&gt;<i> remote peer, and the page origin can collude to cause the browser to
</I>&gt;<i> attack the victim directly.
</I>I don't think such an attack is possible; there is no mechanism in ICE 
for changing the destination IP address without a new handshake.

The potential attack we can't avoid is that a hostile webapp, possibly 
with the help of a hostile STUN server, can cause an ICE handshake 
request to be sent to an UDP IP+port of their choice. The browser can 
rate-limit such attacks easily, and may implement a port-number 
blocklist if that seems appropriate (not sending to port 53 seems 
reasonable).

That seems like a risk that's not unreasonable to accept, given that 
we've survived having the same problem for HTTP links since day one of 
the Web (any web page can dupe a client into launching a TCP session to 
any IP:port and sending &quot;GET /&lt;ASCII string of their choice&gt;&quot; to it).
