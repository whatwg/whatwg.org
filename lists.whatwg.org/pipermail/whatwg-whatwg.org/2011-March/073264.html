Who is the &quot;you&quot; who is doing the trusting in this scenario?

There are a number of potential attacks here, and a number of players who 
are (or should be) all potentially mutually distrustful -- the user, the 
browser, the origin of the page, the TURN server, the remote peer, and any 
potentially victim host that has no intent in being a party to any 
communication. I haven't yet studied the threat model discussed in this 
thread in depth, but if the threat we're talking about is a cross-protocol 
attack on the potential victim host, then the TURN server can be actively 
hostile and is not trusted by the browser, and the remote peer can be 
actively hostile and is also not trusted by the browser. Obviously it's 
not a problem if the TURN server is hostile and an attack is bounced off 
the TURN server, since the TURN server could just mount the attack 
directly. The concern is presumably about whether the TURN server, the 
remote peer, and the page origin can collude to cause the browser to 
attack the victim directly.
