I think you are mixing two issues here (or I am):
- &lt;input type='time' size='5'&gt; should be valid and might actually do
something when the UA supports type='time' ;
- &lt;input type='time' size='5'&gt; should be valid so it can be set for
legacy browsers.

I have no strong opinions against the former issue: I would agree that
an implementation might follow the specs without a date picker. Such
implementation could use the size attribute.

I'm commenting the later issue below.

&gt;&gt;<i> However, I think the web page should set the attributes in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compat check in javascript.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like an unnecessarily complicated and unreliable (Javascript
</I>&gt;<i> might be off) way of doing something fairly simple that authors have
</I>&gt;<i> done (almost) since the dawn of the Web. Old browsers will be happy to
</I>&gt;<i> honor the attributes and new browsers may ignore them (or choose to
</I>&gt;<i> honor them), so why should we need to take a long route?
</I>
My answer was actually assuming that you did want to pass
<A HREF="http://validator.nu/.">http://validator.nu/.</A> And &lt;input type='time' size='5'&gt; isn't valid. In
that case, you can't simply write &lt;input type='time' size='5'&gt; in the
HTML code. My answer was also assuming that you were expecting &lt;input
type='time'&gt; to show a date picker widget and you did want to provide
your own date picker widget when type='time' wasn't supported by the
browser. In that case, you need some javascript.
I don't think you can sanely expect to fully support legacy browsers if
you use HTML5 Forms without javascript. By &quot;fully support&quot; I mean giving
(more or less) the same level of functionality.
