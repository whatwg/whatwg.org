We could.

I'm trying to figure out how this is going to fit in with audio APIs. Chris
Rogers from Google is proposing a graph-based audio API to the W3C Audio
incubator group which would overlap considerably with a Stream processing
API like you're suggesting (although in his proposal processing nodes, not
streams, are first-class).

A fundamental problem here is that HTML media elements have the
functionality of both sources and sinks. You want to see &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;
only as sinks which accept streams. But in that case, if we create an audio
processing API using Streams, we'll need a way to download stream data for
processing that doesn't use &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;, which means we'll need to
replicate &lt;src&gt; elements, the type attribute, networkstates, readystates,
possibly the 'loop' attribute... should we introduce a new object or element
that provides those APIs? How much can be shared with &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;?
Should we be trying to share? (In Chris Rogers' proposal, &lt;audio&gt; elements
are used as sources, not sinks.)
