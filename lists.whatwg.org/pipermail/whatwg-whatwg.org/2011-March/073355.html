</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for your feedback. I'll look into it more tomorrow
</I>&gt;<i> when I update the spec, but in the meantime I had some additional

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * playing tracks synchronised at different offsets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if the in-band tracks will be played at a different time

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> playing independent files. &#160;To implement this we will have to open two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances of a movie, enable different tracks on each, and then play the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two instances in sync.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that acceptable? That is, are you ok with implementing multiple file
</I>&gt;<i> (or two instances of the same file at different offsets) synchronisation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * playing tracks at different rates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition to the limitation listed above, efficient playback of tracks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at different rates will require all tracks to be played in the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it acceptable to implement multiple playback at different rates if
</I>&gt;<i> they're all in the same direction, or would you (at least for now) be
</I>&gt;<i> significantly helped by forcing the playback rates to be the same for all
</I>&gt;<i> slaved media tracks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; * changing any of the above while media is playing vs when it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; stopped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Modifying the media groups while the media is playing is probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impossible to do without stalling. &#160;The media engine may have thrown out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unneeded data from disabled tracks and may have to rebuffer that data,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even in the case of in-band tracks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That makes sense. There's several ways to handle this; the simplest is
</I>&gt;<i> probably to say that when the list of synchronised tracks is changed,
</I>&gt;<i> or when the individual offsets of each track or the individual playback
</I>&gt;<i> rates of each track are changed, the playback of the entire group should
</I>&gt;<i> be automatically stopped. Is that sufficient?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In the future, if media frameworks optimise these cases, or if hardware
</I>&gt;<i> advances sufficiently that even inefficient implementations of this are
</I>&gt;<i> adequate, we could add a separate flag that controls whether or not this
</I>&gt;<i> automatic pausing happens.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From a user's point of view, your proposal seems more complicated than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the basic use cases merit. &#160;For example, attempting to fix the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synchronization of improperly authored media with micro-adjustments of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the playback rate isn't likely to be very successful or accurate. &#160;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> metronome case, while an interesting experiment, would be better served
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through something like the proposed Audio API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. The use cases you mention here aren't the driving factor in this
</I>&gt;<i> design, they're just enabled mostly as a side-effect. The driving factor
</I>&gt;<i> is to avoid the symmetry problem described below:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Slaving multiple media elements' playback rate and current time to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single master media element, Silvia and Eric's proposal, seems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> achieve the needs of the broadest use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with this design is that it is highly asymetric. The
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of a media element needs to have basically two modes: slave
</I>&gt;<i> and master, where the logic for both can be quite different. (Actually,
</I>&gt;<i> three modes if you count the lone media element case as a separate mode.)
</I>&gt;<i> This then also spills into the API, where the master is exposing both the
</I>&gt;<i> network state of its own media, as well as the overall state of playback.
</I>&gt;<i> We end up having to handle all kinds of special cases, such as what
</I>&gt;<i> happens when the master track is shorter than a slaved track, or what
</I>&gt;<i> happens when the master track is paused vs when a slaved track is paused.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not impossible to do, but it is significantly more messy than simply
</I>&gt;<i> having a distinct &quot;master&quot; object and having all the media elements only
</I>&gt;<i> deal with one &quot;mode&quot; (two if a lone media element counts as separate),
</I>&gt;<i> namely the &quot;slave&quot; mode. Any asymetry is reflected as differences between
</I>&gt;<i> the controller and the media element. Each media element only has to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with its own networking state, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For an example of why this matters, consider the use case of a movie site
</I>&gt;<i> with the option of playing movies with a director's commentary track. Some
</I>&gt;<i> director's commentaries are shorted than the movie (most, in fact, since
</I>&gt;<i> many directors stop commenting on the movie when the credits start!). Some
</I>&gt;<i> are longer (e.g. some Futurama commentaries, where the commentary is
</I>&gt;<i> basically a bunch of the cast and crew chatting away for a while and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes they don't really care that the show is over, they still have
</I>&gt;<i> stuff to talk about). If we have to make a media element into the master,
</I>&gt;<i> then how do we handle this case without the site having to determine ahead
</I>&gt;<i> of time which is the longer track to decide which to use as the master?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With just a controller, it doesn't matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Admittedly, as currently specified the controller object lacks a defined
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;current time&quot; and min and max times, and an Web app would have to
</I>&gt;<i> determine what the seek bar should display by looking at all the tracks.
</I>
Independent of the solution that we choose, we have to define what the
common timeline is for the combined resource. I think we should
probably go with the mental model of what it would be when it was
really all encapsulated in a single resource. Thus, if a slave
resource is longer than the main resource, it actually changes the
duration of the combined resource. Thus, we really should have a model
for that duration. Shorter is easier to deal with since you can just
pretend it is a transparent video or silent audio where it lacks
duration.

Also, independent of the model, we have to have a common understanding
if the currentTime and thus a combined transport bar. By default it
makes sense to display that combined transport bar so the user has a
means to interact with the multitrack resource.


&gt;<i> But we can fix that in a later version. It's much harder to fix in the
</I>&gt;<i> case of one media element being promoted to a different state than the
</I>&gt;<i> others, since we already have defined what the media element API does.)
</I>
One thing that I would really like to see is a common menu for turning
on and off tracks. This is particularly important if you have audio
description tracks, so a blind user can immediately find out if such a
track is available and activate it.

Cheers,
Silvia.
