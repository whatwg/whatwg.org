</I>Since span is meant to be a generic container with no inherent meaning 
or formatting of its own (except being understood as being of inline 
display), formatting a span without reference to class would be a pretty 
broad stroke to paint, whereas styling an &lt;i&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;) would be 
reasonably targeted. The only problem is that the advantages for styling 
specificity which formatting tags offer are the same reasons why they 
will more likely conflict when placed in another document. I think the 
nicest solution would be &lt;span class=&quot;italic&quot; 
style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;, but I don't know that the need to export 
contents for external style usage is one worth complicating the markup 
even further for everyone using it.

</I>&gt;<i> could be added, but currently I'm assuming the use-case is only
</I>&gt;<i> presentational markup.  If someone would like to argue that there's

</I>&gt;<i> and we'd still have to deal with the commands that are presentational

</I>Personally, I'm not sure why there needs to be the redundant API with 
insertHTML in the first place, if insertHTML can be standardized (maybe 
with a removeHTML to target specific inserted tags?), so I don't see a 
need for adding the semantic ones on top of that.

</I>
In relation to &lt;strong&gt;, the reason is simply to avoid committing that 
the usage of bold is for &lt;strong&gt; text. What is the practical use of 
using &lt;strong/&gt;? Besides possible clarity in code, for richly semantic 
documents, akin to the detailed level of markup present in TEI documents 
used for marking up classical texts and the like, a browser user (or 
programmer) can shape XQueries (or jQueries)--directly or by a 
user-friendly wrapping GUI--which selectively extract that information.

If one wishes to find all passages in a work of Shakespeare where there 
was indication in the original that there should be strong emphasis, one 
can make a single elegant (and semantic) query which grabs that 
information, while silently ignoring the &lt;span 
style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt; (or &lt;b&gt;) tags which were instead used to 
provide styling of say unmeaningful but bolded text in say the imprint 
or wherever. (The reason to use span over &lt;b&gt;, on the other hand, is 
simply to avoid the tag being at least semantically unamenable to 
alteration by the designer given its always being assumed to be tied to 
boldness by its use of &quot;b&quot;. )

Granted, a user or application might actually wish to search for text of 
a particular formatting rather than a particular meaning, but if they 
are not distinguished, only the former is possible.
