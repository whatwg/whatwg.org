Hi Ian,

While I can't give you feedback on how hard it is to tweak existing
media frameworks into changing the playback rate of different tracks
independently, or start individual tracks with a delay compared to
others, I am fairly sure that none of the existing frameworks
currently supports such for in-band tracks - not while playing, nor
when stopped. I am also finding it hard to find actual use cases for
this that are not somewhat artificially trying to make things parallel
that should not be parallel. The only use case that I can find are
actually text tracks, namely subtitles or captions, which are not
relevant here.

We haven't allowed caption tracks to start with a different
startTimeOffset than the video, nor are we allowing to give them a
different playbackRate to the video. I don't really see a need for
this functionality for multitrack media either. The beat example that
you use in the spec seems artificial to me and rather a functionality
of a drum machine than something I would expect to be solved through
multitrack.

I *hear* that the startTimeOffset and change of playbackRate
functionality may be almost impossible to get from current media
frameworks, but I can't tell from my own experience. More
fundamentally though I don't really see a need for them. Tracks in a
multitrack resource (no matter if in-band or external files) are
rather tightly authored to cover the exact same timeline in my
experience.

Cheers,
Silvia.
