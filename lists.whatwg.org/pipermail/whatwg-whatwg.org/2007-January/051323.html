Cool! (I couldn't find a spec though. Could you point to it?)

OK, so given your position ;) that raises the question of why they don't yet

I'm not sure they should. I think this is the sort of thing that users should
have easy control over and Web publishers shouldn't be burdened with (they're
unlikely to be hyphenation specialists, after all). So my thought was more
that users could themselves create such files (or, more likely for most
users, download someone else's creation) and install it, to have the browser
apply them to all content in that language. I think that's the only way to
ensure users can get the hyphenation that they consider correct. (Obviously
the browser would have to allow multiple hypenation files, for multiple
languages, to be installed.)

The only reason I suggested that browsers could even ship with them is that
doing so would more quickly reach more users; get them aware of and used to
such a nicety. Not a necessity. More a means of 'evangelisation', if you
will. No doubt the first browser to offer this will generate some buzz ;)
