Right. The description of attaching adjacent &lt;cite&gt;s to &lt;blockquote&gt; 
and &lt;q&gt; is not only a heuristic, it's a poor heuristic, because it will 
fail often in those documents where &lt;blockquote&gt; and &lt;cite&gt; are used at 
all. For example, it will fail where one &lt;cite&gt; element is in a 
paragraph immediately between two &lt;blockquote&gt;s, when it may be the 
citation of only one or neither of them.

There are other problems in WA1's current definition of &lt;cite&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-cite">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-cite</A>&gt;. It says:

     This is the correct way to do it:

         &lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is correct!&lt;/q&gt;, said &lt;cite&gt;Ian&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite this being consistent with the example given in the HTML 4 
specification, it is not compatible with the Web (except for the tiny 
part of it found on diveintomark.org and its imitators). All noticable 
graphical browsers default to cite {font-style: italic}, and it is 
inappropriate to italicize someone's name just because you're quoting 
them. Therefore, that's not what Web authors -- or even HTML reference 
authors -- understand &lt;cite&gt; to be for.
&lt;<A HREF="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/phrase/cite.html">http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/phrase/cite.html</A>&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmltags/p/bltags_cite.htm">http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmltags/p/bltags_cite.htm</A>&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="http://urlx.org/microsoft.com/eec70">http://urlx.org/microsoft.com/eec70</A>&gt;
(A counterexample is the Mozilla Developer Center's description of 
&lt;cite&gt;, which uses the same example as the HTML 4 spec, but helpfully 
shows how nonsensically Gecko would render it if you actually used it 
that way. &lt;<A HREF="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML:Element:cite">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML:Element:cite</A>&gt;)

WA1 continues:

     This is also wrong, because the title and the name are not
     references or citations:

         &lt;p&gt;My favourite book is &lt;cite&gt;The Reality
         Dysfunction&lt;/cite&gt; by &lt;cite&gt;Peter F. Hamilton&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

     This is correct, because even though the source is not quoted,
     it is cited:

         &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;cite&gt;the Wikipedia article on
         HTML&lt;/cite&gt;, HTML is defined in formal specifications
         that were developed and published throughout the
         1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

This is also incompatible with the Web, again because nobody would want 
&quot;the Wikipedia article on HTML&quot; italicized unless they were emphasizing 
it. On the other hand, if browser developers decided /en masse/ to 
deitalicize &lt;cite&gt; by default, it would have no presentation at all, so 
many fewer people would bother using it at all.

Further, it is a distinction most authors won't be able to understand. 
For example, which of these paragraphs would be conformant?

     &lt;p&gt;My favourite book is &lt;cite&gt;The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/cite&gt; by
     &lt;cite&gt;Peter F. Hamilton&lt;/cite&gt;, because Hamilton describes
     wormholes as a way of travelling over long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;My favourite book is &lt;cite&gt;The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/cite&gt; by
     &lt;cite&gt;Peter F. Hamilton&lt;/cite&gt;, because of Hamilton's
     description of wormholes.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;My favourite book is &lt;cite&gt;The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/cite&gt; by
     &lt;cite&gt;Peter F. Hamilton&lt;/cite&gt;, because of Hamilton's
     descriptions of various sci-fi ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;My favourite book is &lt;cite&gt;The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/cite&gt; by
     &lt;cite&gt;Peter F. Hamilton&lt;/cite&gt;, because of Hamilton's
     descriptiveness and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;I arrived in Boston having read about half of Peter F.
     Hamilton's latest book, &lt;cite&gt;Pandora's Star&lt;/cite&gt;. This is a
     nearly 900 page book, part one of the &lt;cite&gt;Commonwealth
     Saga&lt;/cite&gt;. I absolutely loved his first saga, the
     &lt;cite&gt;Night's Dawn Trilogy&lt;/cite&gt;. So far this book is
     promising to be just as good.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you can carefully make the distinction between the conformant 
and non-conformant examples, most authors will not. It is not 
plausible, for example, that an author will realize &quot;oh, I'm no longer 
actually mentioning any of Hamilton's ideas from that *particular* 
book, I'd better remove the invisible &lt;cite&gt; element around its title&quot;.

I think a more compatible and visually obvious (if less semantically 
obvious) definition of &lt;cite&gt; is marking up the name of a work: a book, 
film, exhibition, game, etc.

To close on a minor point: en-GB-hixie notwithstanding, it's 
&quot;preceded&quot;, not &quot;preceeded&quot;. :-)

Cheers
