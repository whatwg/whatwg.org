Yes, that should be possible, actually. The encoding of certain
words in a default exception dictionary seems to be a design
choice in TeX rather than a requirement. (By the way, the term
`dictionary' used to designate a set of hyphenation patterns that
are not, in general, words, is quite confusing.)

&gt;<i> DSSSL has an 'hyphenation-exceptions' property which takes a

Interesting. This would be useful for authors who wanted to
indicate a few exceptions without specifying a complete set of
hyphenation patterns. (TeX includes 4,447 patterns, and two or
several sets cannot easily be merged.)

&gt;&gt;<i> [In TeX], hyphenation can [also] be indicated locally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is needed in order to hyphenate words like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rec-ord/re-cord and is the only level that deals with

&gt;<i> This can be done by supplying your own dictionary through the
</I>&gt;<i> 'hyphenate-dictionary' property.
</I>
You seem to have misinterpreted the intended meaning of
`locally'. The two problems are as follows:

1) Given the following sentence: `Don't wait for record companies,
record records yourselves.' In order to hyphenate
this correctly, explicit hyphenation points (\- in TeX) must
be inserted locally, i.e., as part of the words, as follows:
`Don't wait for rec\-ord companies, re\-cord rec\-ords yourselves.'

2) TeX's hyphenation patterns cannot encode spelling changes;
neither can its exception dictionary.
Therefore, spelling changes like backen -&gt; bak-ken must be
indicated explicitly each time the word occurs.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are a few additional caveats. For instance, it is not entirely &gt;&gt; obvious what should be considered to be a `word' or which characters &gt;&gt; should be allowed in a `word' 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [... lots of less important points ...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How does Prince deal with these issues?
</I>
&gt;<i> Prince6 does't try to go beyond Tex.
</I>
Fair enough. I realise that my question ended up rather too far away from the most important issue. I suppose Prince relies on Unicode character classes to identify letters (which is better than Plain TeX's default [unaccented English letters only], but less flexible) and uses a special rule to treat hyphens. Is this a correct assumption? Can I find more information on such details somewhere?
