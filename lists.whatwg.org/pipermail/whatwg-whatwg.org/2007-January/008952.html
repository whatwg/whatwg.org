The spec already allows this:

# This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents, whether 
# they are syntactically valid or not. Certain points in the parsing 
# algorithm are said to be parse errors. The error handling for parse 
# errors is well-defined: user agents must either act as described below 
# when encountering such problems, or must abort processing at the first 
# error that they encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules 
# described below.

The &quot;wishes&quot; of the user agent described above could easily change at the 
whim of the user, via a user interface control such as you propose.

Basically, anything that user agents must do the same in order for content 
to be treated equivalently is in scope. User interface is out of scope (it 
doesn't matter if the browser has an address bar or not, it's still 
processing the Web the same way, for example). Performance characteristics 
are out of scope (it doesn't matter how fast something happens: a browser 
that renders a page in a minute and one that renders it in a second are 
both equivalent). Implementation internals are out of scope (it doesn't 
matter if the browser implements the spec using a neural network or 
imperative algorithms, so long as the end result is the same).

The &quot;tag soup&quot; is just the parsing rules. The parsing rules are part of 
the markup language. The markup language is explicitly in scope.
