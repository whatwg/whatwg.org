<PRE>Also sprach &#216;istein E. Andersen:

 &gt; &gt; Prince6 (www.princexml.com) supports these properties:
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;   hyphenate: none | auto
 &gt; &gt;   hyphenate-dictionary: none | url(...)
 &gt; &gt;   hyphenate-before: &lt;int&gt;
 &gt; &gt;   hyphenate-after: &lt;int&gt;
 &gt; &gt;   hyphenate-lines: none | &lt;int&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;From <A HREF="http://www.princexml.com/howcome/2006/p6/p6demo2.html:">http://www.princexml.com/howcome/2006/p6/p6demo2.html:</A>
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Prince can read the hyphenation format pioneered by TeX and reused by many
 &gt; &gt; other applications. OpenOffice hosts a number of hyphenation dictionaries that
 &gt; &gt; are reusable in Prince6.

 ...
 
 &gt; This is, however, only one part of TeX's hyphenation system. The next level is a
 &gt; hyphenation exception dictionary, a list of fully hyphenated words that would not
 &gt; otherwise be hyphenated correctly. 

Prince doesn't support exception dictionaries. Is it not possible to
encode exceptions in the hyphenation dictionary?

DSSSL has an 'hyphenation-exceptions' property which takes a list of
strings. I'm unsure if it has been implemented, though.

 &gt; In addition to this, hyphenation can be indicated locally. This is needed in order to
 &gt; hyphenate words like rec-ord/re-cord and is the only level that deals with
 &gt; spelling changes.

This can be done by supplying your own dictionary through the
'hyphenate-dictionary' property.

 &gt; There are a few additional caveats. For instance, it is not entirely obvious what
 &gt; should be considered to be a `word' or which characters should be allowed in a
 &gt; `word' (given that only `words' can be hyphenated using this kind of algorithms).
 &gt; TeX uses `category codes' to define letters, and Unicode's character classes
 &gt; give a good approximation, but they cannot be redefined to deal with specific
 &gt; issues. In Italian, for instance, dell'opera should be hyphenated dell'o-
 &gt; pera, but opera should not be hyphenated o-pera. (The particular example may
 &gt; be wrong, but the principle is correct.) Unless the apostrophe is
 &gt; considered to be a `letter' (a constituent of a `word'), correct patterns do not
 &gt; help, as `dell'opera' will not be considered as one unit during hyphenation-point
 &gt; look-up.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Another example worth mentioning is that Polish and a few other languages
 &gt; apparently require a hyphenated word like xxx-yyy to be hyphenated xxx-
 &gt; -yyy (with an extra hyphen carried over). A truly flexible system would allow
 &gt; to specify, e.g., which non-letters to treat as part of words and which to give
 &gt; special treatment. (As we all know, TeX hyphenates xxx-yyy as xxx-
 &gt; yyy; in addition, the hyphen prohibits xxx and yyy from being hyphenated,
 &gt; which may or may not be suitable depending on, e.g., column width.)
 &gt; 
 &gt; How does Prince deal with these issues?

Prince6 does't try to go beyond Tex.
