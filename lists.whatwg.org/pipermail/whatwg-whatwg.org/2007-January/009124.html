Sorry, I didn't make myself clear. The &lt;cite&gt; in my example does /not/
link anywhere. My point was that even with the mere knowledge that the
contents of &lt;cite&gt; are a citation, agents can construct useful web
queries. Not as good as a &lt;cite&gt; with a URI, but not /useless/.

&gt;<i> &gt; It would be more accurate to see &lt;cite&gt; could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be improved upon. IMHO it would be nicer to have real elements in HTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for detailed bibliographic elements, but that goes against the general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus that we should shift detailed semantics into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; microformats/roles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if we accept that full bibliographic data will only be accepted as a 
</I>&gt;<i> microformat, does &lt;cite&gt; have enough value to warrant keeping it? If the best 
</I>&gt;<i> use case we can manage is &quot;it could link to a search for the source&quot; I would say 
</I>&gt;<i> the element is worthless.
</I>
My point was it could be used as the basis for a search by an automated
agent. This would be true of a microformat like hcite too, /if/ there
any guarantee that Web Applications 1.0 compatible user agents would
support such a microformat. (Of course, if there were such a guarantee,
one would have to ask why the microformat in question wasn't part of the
spec in the first place.) Guaranteed recognition of the &lt;cite&gt; element
is better than nothing.

&gt;<i> I suspect that browser makers would be unwilling to implement this change since 
</I>&gt;<i> there are probably a fair few sites that depend on &lt;cite&gt; being italic to look 
</I>&gt;<i> as the author intended and, as far as I know, major browsers have essentially 
</I>&gt;<i> interoperable default style sheets so making this change would &quot;break&quot; sites 
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the competition.
</I>
&gt;<i>From the perspective of website visitors, I'm not such a change would be
</I>remarkable. For example, in some bibliographic styles, book titles for
example are non-italic anyway. From the perspective of authors, a fix
preserving the faulty semantics is trivial (style cite italic) and a
revision of their site to use the correct semantics is desirable.

I asked:
&gt;<i> Deprecating &lt;cite&gt; wouldn't solve any problems, as far as I can see. How
</I>&gt;<i>  would you connect &lt;q&gt; or &lt;blockquote&gt; to a particular hCite block?
</I>
James Graham replied:
&gt;<i> Indeed in many cases where citations are important there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> direct quote to match the citation (almost all scientific papers fit this 
</I>&gt;<i> model). 
</I>
This might well be an argument for providing ways to explicitly connect
&lt;cite&gt; with elements other than &lt;q&gt; or &lt;blockquote&gt; (a global attribute
&quot;citeref&quot; could perhaps do that rather well). Given the existence of the
humanities (a literary form in which extended series of quotations are
decorated with footnotes and occasional commentary), I can't see how
it's in any way an argument against providing ways to explicitly connect
&lt;cite&gt; with &lt;q&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt;.

James Graham continued:
&gt;<i> But, accepting that some people think this is very important, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> see how a &lt;cite&gt; element that is not part of the microformat helps here - unless 
</I>&gt;<i> sandwiching stuff in &lt;cite&gt; without the microformat filling can itself lead to 
</I>&gt;<i> the development of worthwhile UA features.
</I>
Well, the original idea was the &lt;cite&gt; could contain some sort of link,
and that this would be a way of associating a URI with a &lt;q&gt; or
&lt;blockquote&gt;. To this I made an additional point, that the mere act of
marking up a bit of content as a citation with &lt;cite&gt; makes it easier to
perform more sophisticated automated processing, such as retrieving a
&quot;best guess&quot; source.

How worthwhile such automated processing is depends partly on whether
the spec and tools make it easy to provide citations in URI form.
