<PRE>Matthew,

I'm afraid you were misinformed.

At <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2003Oct/0028">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/2003Oct/0028</A> you can
see a report I made on 2003 October in which I first encountered this
work.  I was looking for &quot;XForms Basic,&quot; the name of a Working Draft
from the W3C Forms Working group, and found that the #2 hit on Google
was <A HREF="http://www.damowmow.com/temp/hfp.html">http://www.damowmow.com/temp/hfp.html</A> , a site which currently
redirects to the WHAT-WG site, and whose robots.txt entry has apparently
subsequently caused its removal from archive.org (apparently
subsequently as Google managed to index it, and they obey robots.txt). 

As I recall, this document used the W3C's stylesheet and formats,
including a background PNG saying &quot;W3C Working Draft,&quot; and bore the
title &quot;XForms Basic.&quot;  Based on mail notes from the time, I've extracted
this description of the relationship bewteen that document and the W3C's
XForms:  &quot;XForms is aimed at the specialist form authoring world, for
products that will not typically be sent over, or used as part of, the
World Wide Web.&quot;

So again, I must agree that the pre-history of Web Forms 2.0 is a direct
counter to XForms, but I must also agree that we should focus on current
technical issues, and not attempt to reconstruct a history of blissfully
ignorant parallel evolution.

Leigh.

   &quot;This specification is in no way aimed at replacing XForms 1.0
[XForms], nor is it a subset of XForms 1.0.&quot;

   Where can I read a similar statement about XForms-Tiny not replacing
WF2? &quot;Pot calling the kettle black&quot;? Bullsh*t!
