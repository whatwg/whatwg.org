Yes.

Well, there's some room for that (that's mostly what the green notes are 
in the spec), but in general those notes are only included for 
uncontroversial suggestions -- when there's the slightest suggestion of 
controversy, the suggestions are best included outside the spec. I 
encourage you to post such suggestions on the blog (to gather feedback) 
and then to create Wiki pages detailing the suggestions and including 
summaries of the feedback you received. You could have suggestions for UI 
for browsers for various features in the spec, as well as including 
suggestions such as the one you mentioned in this thread.
