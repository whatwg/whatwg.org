</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The origin of this thread was my request for adding attributes to all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements to support microformat-like semantic markup. Based on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> context of your reply, it seems you are agreeing with Matthew Raymond 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in his assertion that using microformat-like semantic markup is A Bad 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thing(tm). Am I understanding your position correctly? (If I'm not, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> please forgive me.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, IMHO mpt's point is far broader and consequentially more 
</I>&gt;<i> important than the confines of the original thread.
</I>
Broader, yes (and I should have changed the Subject). I don't know 
about more important, because I have no experience in &quot;microformat-like 
markup&quot;, and I have no idea how important it will be. So I wasn't 
commenting on it at all (though Matthew Raymond's arguments seem 
cogent).

&gt;<i> The point, as I understand it, is that machine analysis of &quot;semantic&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> markup fails if the markup construct is (ab)used in so many different 
</I>&gt;<i> ways that the interpretation of any particular fragment is no longer 
</I>&gt;<i> unambiguous. This is a sort of &quot;heat[1] death&quot; of the original 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics; as the use of an element becomes increasingly disordered 
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. higher entropy), it becomes impossible to extract any useful 
</I>&gt;<i> information from the use of that element. This is critical in the 
</I>&gt;<i> proper design of semantic markup languages because one wishes to stave 
</I>&gt;<i> off the heat death as long as possible so that, as far as possible, 
</I>&gt;<i> UAs can perform useful functions based on the information in the 
</I>&gt;<i> markup (e.g. render it to a media for which the content was not 
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly designed). Obviously I don't know how to achieve this but 
</I>&gt;<i> there are a few things to consider:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Have enough elements.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> * Don't have too many elements:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> * Make the semantics of elements well defined:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> * Have some &quot;high entropy&quot; elements.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> * Allow easy extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
I think this is exactly right. Another point I would add is &quot;implement 
the semantic benefit early and often&quot;. The earlier and more widely 
software is distributed that takes advantage of the semantics, the more 
easily people can see whether they are using semantic markup 
appropriately. I hinted at this earlier when I said that whether 
&lt;section&gt; becomes a semantic element &quot;will depend on who is faster: UA 
vendors distributing software that prominently takes advantage of the 
structure &lt;section&gt; is supposed to provide, or eager tech Weblog 
authors misguidedly replacing all the occurrences of &lt;div&gt; with 
&lt;section&gt; in their templates in an attempt to be 'more semantic'.&quot;
&lt;<A HREF="http://urlx.org/dreamhost.com/a73e1">http://urlx.org/dreamhost.com/a73e1</A>&gt;

The &quot;Don't have too many elements&quot; guideline bears on Joe Clark's 
complaint that &quot;'HTML5' replicates HTML's obsession with 
computer-science and math elements&quot; 
&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.fawny.org/2006/10/28/tbl-html">http://blog.fawny.org/2006/10/28/tbl-html</A>&gt;. It is true that HTML's few 
semantic elements are biased toward computer science (but not math), 
but that's because computer-science people are those most likely to 
bother with semantic markup at all (Joe being a notable exception). And 
adding representative elements from other fields of endeavor would 
likely result in too many elements overall.

&gt;<i> This post was brought to you by the society for dodgy physical 
</I>&gt;<i> analogies concocted in the middle of the night.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
As another analogy, in a recent message to Ian I referred to such 
presentational elements as &quot;safety valves&quot;.

Whenever someone uses &lt;div&gt;, don't say &quot;alas, that's a hole in HTML&quot;; 
say &quot;hooray, that's someone who isn't misusing &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;.
