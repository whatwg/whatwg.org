Yes, where what the previous version did = nothing.

</I>&gt;<i> at the cost of other development.
</I>
You may be right.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second, it's hard for authors to use it in a way that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backward-compatible. That is, if the source information is important
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough that it needs to be accessible in those UAs that don't (yet)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fashion too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, but as a spec writer you then risk entering the terrain of 
</I>&gt;<i> dumbing down the Web for everyone, just because some people are still 
</I>&gt;<i> using lousy UAs.
</I>
Good luck convincing people that their browser is lousy because it 
doesn't present citations. I expect the typical response would be &quot;Eh?&quot;

&gt;<i> Some of us feel that such information should be *available* but not 
</I>&gt;<i> *visible* per se, because making it visible will often only lead to 
</I>&gt;<i> distraction from the actual text.
</I>
Ah, but we already have a thoroughly compatible element for conditional 
presentation of information: &lt;a&gt;. So a backward-compatible way of 
citing sources would be an attribute that points to either &lt;a&gt; (if the 
full citation should be out of the flow of text), or to another element 
(if it should be inline).

For example:

     &lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;q018&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/2007/01/21/c">http://example.com/2007/01/21/c</A>&quot;&gt;Fred
     Mondegreen concurs&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;q source=&quot;#q018&quot;&gt;When you compare it
     with books, the Web is still a newborn baby&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;As &lt;span id=&quot;q019&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein said during an interview
     in 1949&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;q source=&quot;#q019&quot;&gt;I do not know how the Third
     World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use
     in the Fourth &#8212; rocks!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Disclaimer: I don't expect people would actually use this, unless 
there was some famous semantic application taking advantage of it. The 
same applies to cite=.)

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And third, it requires the existence of an IRI of some sort. Often you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> won't have this, for example when the source information for your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quote is something as vague as &quot;attributed to Mark Twain&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that in such a case it would be appropriate to have the cite
</I>&gt;<i> attribute's content point to the source that attributes it to Twain, 
</I>&gt;<i> like so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;q cite=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;To be, or not to be&lt;/q&gt;, as Mark Twain supposedly said.
</I>
Google notwithstanding, the Web does not contain all quotable material 
that exists. If the source is a pamphlet, magazine, user manual, or 
interview, there may well be *no* relevant URL to cite.

Cheers
