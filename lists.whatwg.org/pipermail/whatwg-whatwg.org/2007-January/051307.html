</I>
Sure. But is it realistic to expect this to change? What expected  
payoff is there for tool vendors for providing a non-deceptive UI for  
&lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;?

&gt;<i> An actual test would have been to provide people with a widespread
</I>&gt;<i> interface that accurately reported that they were emphasizing rather
</I>&gt;<i> than italicizing.
</I>
Part of the overall &quot;test&quot; is that such UIs haven't been launched  
with success in the last 14 years.

&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are both primarily used to achieve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bold rendering on the visual media. Regardless of which tags authors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type or which tags their editor shortcuts produce, authors tend to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think in terms of encoding italicizing and bolding instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowingly articulating their profound motivation for using italics or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bold.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's a bad habit picked up from WYSIWIG word processing. If  
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> were still habituated to typewriters you'd be insisting on the  
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsic
</I>&gt;<i> utility of &lt;u&gt;. ;)
</I>
More to the point, there is utility in being able to typeset a word  
or two differently in a paragraph. In theory, that's &lt;em&gt;. But in  
practice the choice between &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; is motivated by the  
default visual rendering.

Therefore, the situation is that there are two &quot;semantic&quot; elements  
for making a piece of text different: &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;. The choice  
depends on the preferred default visual rendering: italic vs. bold.  
In practice this isn't any different from saying that the semantics  
of &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are to set text differently with default visual  
renderings being italics and bold.

&gt;&gt;<i> Even those who have heard about the theoretical reasons for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; have all been in HTML for over a decade.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that&#8217;s long enough to see what happens in the wild. I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is time to give up and admit that there are two pairs of visually-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oriented synonyms instead of putting more time, effort, money, blog
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posts, spec examples and discussion threads into educating people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about subtle differences in the hope that important benefits will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realized once people use these elements the &#8220;right&#8221; way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we accepted that only a few people have heard about the theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> advantages of em and strong, wouldn't that suggest that the web
</I>&gt;<i> standards community has not done enough communicating, not that
</I>&gt;<i> communication has been understood but ineffective because its
</I>&gt;<i> prescriptions are somehow impractical?
</I>
Perhaps, but what's the payoff of vehemently communicating more about  
this? Is it worth it? Would there be a different way to get the same  
payoff?

&gt;<i> There are consequences to using &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;strong&gt;. Being ambiguous, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are insufficient hooks for  
</I>&gt;<i> speech
</I>&gt;<i> CSS styling by the author, at least not without additional classes.)
</I>
&lt;em&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are exactly as stylable. &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are also  
equally stylable.

&gt;<i> Because they are so ambiguous, talking UAs will have to announce those
</I>&gt;<i> elements as &quot;italic&quot; and &quot;bold&quot; rather than applying any specific  
</I>&gt;<i> aural
</I>&gt;<i> styling such as a different rate or pitch of speech.  Because
</I>&gt;<i> announcements slow down reading speed much more than voice  
</I>&gt;<i> alterations,
</I>&gt;<i> it is likely that talking agent users will turn them off. Which means
</I>&gt;<i> their web experience will be ultimately degraded.
</I>
When an author presses command-i, he may not even know what markup is  
generated. The choice between &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; is  
pretty much up to chance. This means that in *practice* &lt;em&gt; and  
&lt;strong&gt; are, on the real Web out there, about exactly as ambiguous  
as &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;. Since voice browsers aren't truly able to extract  
significance out of the choice of &lt;em&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt; (as the choice of  
element is largely up to chance), I conclude that reading them  
differently from each other isn't a particularly useful idea.

If &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; have been implemented in an annoying way for the aural  
media, isn't the conclusion that it would even be rational for  
WYSIWYG tool vendors to use &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; for italics and bold to  
avoid annoyances on the aural media? (Moreover, as currently defined,  
&lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; have more versatile content models in XHTML5, which  
means tool vendors would have an additional incentive to emit those  
elements.)

&gt;&gt;<i> I think using span with a style attribute is a bad idea in this case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Italicizing a word or two in a paragraph is not incidental style that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could easily be considered optional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Surely it /is/ an incidental style, since authors, publication houses,
</I>&gt;<i> and style guides vary in their preferences about when to italicize.
</I>&gt;<i> Surely it is the distinctions between foreign and native languages,
</I>&gt;<i> between emphasis and non-emphasis, between titles and non-titles,  
</I>&gt;<i> and so
</I>&gt;<i> forth, that are non-incidental, and that italicization imperfectly
</I>&gt;<i> reflects. The typography is not the message; it is only its shadow.
</I>
Granted, but italics and bold are more sticky properties of the text  
than e.g. font family, font size or column width, so it is a mistake  
to treat all style properties as being equally incidental and  
expendable.

&gt;&gt;<i> It is a more essential part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the text that should be preserved when the content is formatted for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different display environment possibly with a different font.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would a different font conflict with its italicization?
</I>
It wouldn't. My point was that italic and bold are stickier or closer  
to being part of content than the font.

&gt;<i> Did you mean in a UA like Lynx that doesn't support CSS?
</I>
No, but Lynx supports the point that &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are different from  
other text foremost and italic and bold if possible. The copy of Lynx  
available to me renders &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; all in the same  
way but differently from normal paragraph text.
