</I>
Robin Williams' /The Mac is not a typewriter/ -- which, if I recall, 
advises against underlining -- was first published in 1990 and is still 
in print. Probably the underlining of links quelled underlining for 
emphasis on the Web.

&gt;<i> More to the point, there is utility in being able to typeset a word or 
</I>&gt;<i> two differently in a paragraph. In theory, that's &lt;em&gt;. But in 
</I>&gt;<i> practice the choice between &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; is motivated by the 
</I>&gt;<i> default visual rendering.
</I>
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, in itself. It's shorter 
than &lt;emphasis class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt; and &lt;emphasis class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;. :-)

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; have all been in HTML for over a decade.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think that&#8217;s long enough to see what happens in the wild. I think 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it is time to give up and admit that there are two pairs of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visually-
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> oriented synonyms instead of putting more time, effort, money, blog
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> posts, spec examples and discussion threads into educating people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about subtle differences in the hope that important benefits will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> realized once people use these elements the &#8220;right&#8221; way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we accepted that only a few people have heard about the theoretical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantages of em and strong, wouldn't that suggest that the web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standards community has not done enough communicating, not that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communication has been understood but ineffective because its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prescriptions are somehow impractical?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps, but what's the payoff of vehemently communicating more about 
</I>&gt;<i> this? Is it worth it? Would there be a different way to get the same 
</I>&gt;<i> payoff?
</I>
I think the problem is not with how few people have &quot;heard about the 
theoretical advanges of em and strong&quot;, but with how many have got the 
mistaken impression that they are replacements for and improvements on 
&lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;.

This is where we really need results from Google Markup Search (paging 
Mr Hickson): What proportion of pages use &lt;em&gt; and/or &lt;strong&gt;, what 
proportion of these appear to be generated using a Wysiwyg tool, what 
proportion also use &lt;i&gt; and/or &lt;b&gt;, and can a sample of their URLs be 
provided for the purpose of surveying how often &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; are 
used inappropriately?

The message &quot;please use &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; unless you really know what you're 
doing, and generate &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; unless your users really know what 
they're doing&quot; is *not* well-known. It has not yet consumed much time, 
effort, money, blog posts, spec examples or discussion threads. In the 
absence of other evidence, I think it is worth trying.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are consequences to using &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;strong&gt;. Being ambiguous, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are insufficient hooks for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speech CSS styling by the author, at least not without additional 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classes.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;em&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are exactly as stylable. &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are also 
</I>&gt;<i> equally stylable.
</I>
Benjamin's statement would have been more accurate if he'd said &quot;for 
speech CSS styling by the screenreader&quot;, because a screenreader would 
be more likely to specify different default intonations for &lt;em&gt; and 
&lt;i&gt; than an author would. But even if there are any screenreaders yet 
that make such a distinction (are there any? I forget), that's a very 
small benefit for a very small audience. Fantasai's example of emphasis 
in Chinese text is much more interesting.
