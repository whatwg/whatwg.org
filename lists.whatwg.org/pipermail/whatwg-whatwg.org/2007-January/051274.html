</I>
No I don't. At least I don't remember doing that a significant number of times. 
It's very rare that I've wanted to look up metadata for a book that I have in my 
hand.

What you might mean is that _other_people_ might want to look up metadata about 
a book that I have quoted. For subset of books the ISBN is indeed a compact 
identifier that can be used to find this data. Of course compact implies 
human-unreadable which is a problem if you require humans to enter it.

&gt;<i> In other words, for most books published in the last 37 years it's easy.
</I>&gt;<i> And if it isn't easy, then the book probably doesn't have an ISBN
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>
That timing assumes that I have the book that I am quoting from open on the desk 
in front of me. It is just as likely that I am quoting from notes I made e.g. 
for the case of a reference book in a library (in which case I could write down 
the ISBN, if one exists, but would have to do so in addition to writing down 
human friendly metadata like, say, the book's title and author which I could 
use to make sense of my notes), that I'm quoting from memory, that I'm repeating 
a quote from a secondary source (e.g. looking up a quote from /Hamlet/ in a book 
of Shakespeare criticism because it is easier to find), quoting from a book 
without an ISBN or doing number of other things which prevent the ISBN from 
being close at hand.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/citation">http://microformats.org/wiki/citation</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll mark up author, title, place of publication and date.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Time taken: 1 minute, 59 seconds. And yes, if you've eagle eyes you'll
</I>&gt;<i> have noticed I still managed to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) mistype vcard;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) mess up the end &lt;span&gt; tag for &lt;span class=&quot;vard&quot;&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) forget to add an end &lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) miss out the space between the author and the title.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So that will be non-conformant, unparsable, and typographically
</I>&gt;<i> illiterate. Three cheers for the wonders of hand-coding. ;)
</I>
However hand coding is still the way that most documents, and certianly most 
semantically rich documents, are produced. People have been expecting &quot;the tools 
to save us&quot; forever but it still hasn't happened. I don't see why it will be any 
different for citation data, a subject about which most authors don't care a jot.

&gt;<i> And if typing 10-13 digit numbers still sounds like too much hard work,
</I>&gt;<i> the state of the art is to dangle a book in front of your webcam and
</I>&gt;<i> have your software grab its details of the web's bibliographic
</I>&gt;<i> databases.
</I>
Which webcam would that be? Using which software? I don't have those tools and 
neither do most authors.

&gt;<i> ISBNs may be all very well for modern books, I here the sceptics among
</I>&gt;<i> you cry, but what about all the other stuff on your shelves, from before
</I>&gt;<i> 1970? Let's conduct another experiment. I return to my bookshelf and
</I>&gt;<i> pull out the mustiest, most obscure book I can find. I open it up
</I>&gt;<i> gingerly; it's trying hard to fall to bits. ISBN?
</I>
Sure you can find metadata for any book if you try hard enough. But that's not 
the question. The question is &quot;why would authors bother&quot;?. The fact that the 
process, as you describe it, is quite involved suggests the answer is &quot;they won't&quot;.

&gt;<i> James Graham reports from the front that: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've never met anyone who enjoys filling in BibTeX citations, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example and that is of comparable difficulty to the process you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advocate
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The difficulty of filling in BibTeX citations rather depends on whether
</I>&gt;<i> you do it by laboriously by hand or whether you use software that will
</I>&gt;<i> query library databases for you and autofill most of the data.
</I>
I use software (well specifically I can look up BibTeX entries on the web for 
everything I'm interested in citing, then it is just a few copies and pastes 
away from a working citation) and I still find it tedious and frustrating. I 
also know people who have the option of using tools like BibTeX and opt to enter 
all the citations by hand.

&gt;<i> As for people enjoying filling in citations, I've already pointed to two
</I>&gt;<i> communities crazy enough to /pay/ for the privilege of doing so: the
</I>&gt;<i> customers of LibraryThing and Delicious Library:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.librarything.com/">http://www.librarything.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">http://www.delicious-monster.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you seem to worry I propose forcing people dig up information in
</I>&gt;<i> which they have no interest. On the contrary, I see people cataloguing
</I>&gt;<i> tedious metadata, or struggling to find where quotations came from, and
</I>&gt;<i> want software to do it for them.
</I>
Sure, there will be people who want all this data but expecting authors to 
provide it just because a fraction of users want it is unrealistic. For people 
who are prepared to put the effort in a microformat seems more appropriate than 
a complex set of elements in HTML core. Indeed even in the kinds of journal 
where citation data is important it seems the existing &lt;cite&gt; element is not 
used; I checked both The Astrophysical Journal and Nature and couldn't see any 
evidence for the use of the &lt;cite&gt; element. However Nature does seem to have set 
of microformat-like classes: cite-month-year; journalname; journalnumber; etc.
