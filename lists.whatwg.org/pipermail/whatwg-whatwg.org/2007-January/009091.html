Excellent idea!

A community site could allow user-contributed script to add functionality to
the community on sites such as free-form as a wiki, and hence with
open-ended use cases. But that's not really possible today because the
almost certainty of maliciousness.

I'm working on such a real world use case and would like to solve the pain.
I'd rather not describe it explicitly yet, but consider a situation where I
have a script that operates on a section of HTML that allows plugs-in from
arbitrary URLs.  A webmaster could use this but would have to trust that the
webmaster of the plugins would not change their script after he used them
and thus would be much less likely to use this functionality. If he could
sandbox it, that requirement for trust would be diminished and it would
increase the likelihood the use of the functionality would spread. FYI, an
IFRAME would NOT work for this use-case as it is about linking script files
ot the main document, not about visual widgets.

BTW, I'd ALSO like a sandbox capability that completely disables script for
use within blog comment sections and forum posts etc.
