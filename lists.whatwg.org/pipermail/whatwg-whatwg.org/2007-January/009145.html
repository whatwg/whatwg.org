</I>
I could have said &quot;in my 24 years of reading in a wide variety of 
fields I have never, not once, come across a document that 
intentionally used italics to indicate it was quoting someone&quot;, but I 
was trying to be concise.

&gt;<i> There are even situations where this would be appropriate in
</I>&gt;<i> modern English, which seems to be your frame of reference here. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, when cited as the source of a quotation from a transcript in
</I>&gt;<i> British legal writing: &quot;Counsel's name should appear in upper-and
</I>&gt;<i> lower-case italics&quot; (Oxford Guide to Style (ISBN 0-19-869175-0), 423).
</I>
If counsel themselves quotes someone else, does the transcript 
italicize the name of that someone else?

I think what you're describing is a transcript, which should use 
&lt;dialog&gt; (wherein you can style &lt;dt&gt; to be italic), not &lt;cite&gt;.

&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, that's not what Web authors
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notorious for their understandable errors.
</I>
Which is relevant, because semantic markup is useful to the extent that 
Web authors don't make errors using it.

&gt;&gt;<i> -- or even HTML reference authors 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Justly notorious for promoting such mistakes through misinformation.
</I>
Ditto.

&gt;&gt;<i> -- understand &lt;cite&gt; to be for.

</I>
Good for you, but did you really expect Microsoft to make changes that 
reflect the behavior of neither their own browser nor (in the case of 
&lt;cite&gt;) anyone else's?

&gt;<i> If MSDN is supposed to be the measure for HTML5, we might as well pack
</I>&gt;<i> it in, since they'll misrepresent whatever the spec says anyhow. Also, 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're being unfair to htmlhelp.com, who say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The CITE element is used to markup citations, such as titles of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> magazines or newspapers, ship names, references to other sources, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quotation attributions. Visual browsers typically render CITE as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> italic text, but authors can suggest a rendering using style sheets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This description is /entirely/ compatible with the usage under
</I>&gt;<i> discussion (&quot;quotation attributions&quot;).
</I>
Quotable ships? Whatever next?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think a more compatible and visually obvious (if less semantically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obvious) definition of &lt;cite&gt; is marking up the name of a work: a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> book, film, exhibition, game, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're arguing for changing the semantic meaning of an HTML element
</I>&gt;<i> based on a set of modern English typographic conventions about the
</I>&gt;<i> formatting of citations. This line of argument is self-contradictory
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Modern English typographic conventions are crystal clear that the
</I>&gt;<i> entire reference is the citation, /not/ just or even especially the
</I>&gt;<i> italicized part.
</I>
Yes, it would be more precise if the element was called &lt;work&gt; -- but 
also more ambiguous, and much less backward-compatible.

&gt;<i> (2) Modern English typographic conventions do not always use italics 
</I>&gt;<i> for the name of a work. For example, by the Oxford Guide to Style 
</I>&gt;<i> (ISBN
</I>&gt;<i> 0-19-869175-0), the titles of articles, orations, unpublished works,
</I>&gt;<i> treaties, parliamentary statutes (and in British legal writing, even US
</I>&gt;<i> statutes), European secondary legislation, books of the Bible
</I>&gt;<i> and /suwar/ of the Koran, and rabbinical works that have become
</I>&gt;<i> nicknames (on this, see p. 541) are not italicized, and those of poems
</I>&gt;<i> frequently are not.
</I>
Yep. And if that issue, and the others you listed, prevent the 
redefinition, I think the next best solution would be to drop &lt;cite&gt; 
entirely. If a semantic element is needed for citations, introduce a 
&lt;citation&gt; element that legacy browsers won't italicize.
