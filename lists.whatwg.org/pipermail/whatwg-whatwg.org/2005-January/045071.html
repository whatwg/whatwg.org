That's because there is no semantics in HTML other than web document
semantics, something it is actually highly likely it uses - since most
other search engines do.  Hn elements more important, google lists
reading from OL/UL etc.

It's not a case of starving one to boosting another, the point is that
incremental edge additions to HTML won't achieve anything, would
XForms, who knows, I personally doubt it until there's a rendering
model beyond HTML in the mix.

</I>
However you have the same problems with the migration to WebForms and
WebApplications from HTML, you have to believe that it'll offer
significant advantage (I can see none, since it simply doesn't work on
any user agents yet, and there's no likelyhood of it happening on IE -
especially if binary plugins are rejected as a solution.)

You can't claim the migration to XForms won't happen, but somehow the
migration to WebForms will, they both suffer from the same fundamental
problems - You can create compatible WebForms docs within the single
document, but it's far from trivial, and you miss out on quite a few
of the benefits.  I don't in fact believe it will be easy enough for
your normal developer, just like XForms isn't - It took Ian a few
attempts to create the few basic examples on the site, and he's hardly
your average developer.

Jim.
