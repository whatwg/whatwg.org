Well, the motivation is to make it easier to build web applications, by 
having a standard declarative way to build forms with validation, menus 
etc. This may give a tremendous increase in productivity for web 
authors, and give the user a more consistent experience. You might as 
well argue that UI frameworks like Java Swing or Windows.Forms are 
superflous since there is nothing preventing each developer from hand 
coding his own UI libraries (which is basically what is happening in the 
web application world).

Of course it would be cool if WHATWG could extend the underlying 
platform with things you can't do with script now, but this is not 
goning to  happen as long as Microsoft are not part of WHAT (and even if 
they were, it would take years).
