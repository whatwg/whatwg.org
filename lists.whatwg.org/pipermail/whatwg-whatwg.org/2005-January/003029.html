<PRE>I was just reading through the spec and noted a few things that caught 
my eye. I took some notes, which I'm sending to you with only slight 
elaboration.

2.4.2: for controls with date and time types that don't have timzone 
information, would it be better if the zero point where 
1970-01-01T00:00:00.0 (the epoch in the local time zone)?
6.2: why specify that image controls are treated as two controls with 
specific names if they're just going to be skipped? (step 4, paragraphs 
3 and 4). The same thing is specified for form submission, because 
that's where it matters.
8.1: :indeterminate &#8212; what good is it? If it's defined in a different 
standard and you're clarifying how it interacts with this one, perhaps a 
note to that effect?

The rest are just editorial in nature.

2.15: 'form script' =&gt; 'for scripts'
5.6: grammar? 'In the tables below, cells that specify that the case 
should be handled as another represent cases where the given attribute 
combinations are otherwise meaningless. In such cases, the encoded data 
set is created from the fallback encoding type, not the specified 
encoding type.' This just feels awkward. Had to read it several times to 
figure out what it means.
5.6.1: combine put and post columns as in previous table
5.6.4: 'Thus the replace attribute is effectively ignored when enctype 
is a mailto URI.' should be '&#8230;when action is a mailto: URI.'
6.1: mentions type attribute on select element, but then states that all 
attributes on select element are ignored. Probably just needs to be 
reworded.
7.1: '&#8230;much like happens for the default action of change and input 
events.' should be '&#8230;much like what happens&#8230;'

Also, do you know of anyone with plans to implement this in Mozilla?
