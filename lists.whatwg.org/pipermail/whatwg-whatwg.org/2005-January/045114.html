<PRE>Also sprach Jon Ferraiolo:

 &gt; I haven't been following WebForms in the past few months, but when my 
 &gt; colleague Bill McCoy told me that he has participated in this forum, I took 
 &gt; a look.

Great to have you here!

 &gt; I looked at the WebForms 2.0 spec and was surprised at its size. I created 
 &gt; a PDF out of the WebForms spec and got 101 pages. In comparison, I created 
 &gt; a PDF out of the XForms 1.0 spec and got 127 pages. Given that WebForms is 
 &gt; still under development and XForms is approved, one would expect some 
 &gt; further growth, making the size of the two specs about the same.

I think you raise a valid point; ideally the specification will become
smaller rather than larger from now on. However, XForms has
dependencies on other specifications (XSD, XPath) which makes it more
complex than a page count seems. WF has similar dependencies on DOM
but this seems less scary since DOM is already deployed.

 &gt; When I did a quick survey of features, I see major overlap. My conclusion 
 &gt; is that WebForms to a large extent is simply just a competitive format with 
 &gt; XForms. If you are going to add 100+ pages of incremental features to the 
 &gt; browser world, of which a major portion has already been defined by the 
 &gt; W3C, why not build from XForms, which is an approved standard 

HTML is also an approved standard. 

 &gt; Perhaps Web Forms started out with the goal of doing something small as 
 &gt; minor increments to existing HTML, but now it seems to have grown into a 
 &gt; rather large beast of its own. Also, perhaps Web Forms started when XForms 
 &gt; had little traction and therefore could be discounted, but in 2004 interest 
 &gt; in XForms has picked up quite a bit.

Perhaps. Personally, I don't hear the thunder.
