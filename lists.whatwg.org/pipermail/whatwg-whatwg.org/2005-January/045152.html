Sure. If Web applications were semantic they'd need HTML block elements 
such as &lt;login&gt;, &lt;register&gt;, &lt;order&gt;, and &lt;post&gt;. Since such elements 
would be of negligible benefit to any author or UA, there's no point in 
introducing their complexity (and authors can use &lt;div&gt; instead).

If the What-WG's work increases the average fraction of any particular 
application that is written in HTML or XHTML rather than script and/or 
arbitary XML, we do benefit. We all benefit currently, for example, 
from Amazon's and IMDb's databases showing up in Google search results 
-- which they wouldn't do if written entirely in script and/or FooML. 
(And the application hosts benefit in turn from the search engine 
traffic.)

&gt;<i> If the WHAT WG's aim is to discourage what they call street HTML,
</I>
No member of What-WG has called anything &quot;street HTML&quot;, on the WG's 
site or (except at your insistent prompting) on this mailing list.

&gt;<i> then removing the ambiguity and the mess of the existing HTML and 
</I>&gt;<i> de-facto specifications into something well grounded will be a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> more useful than simply introducing more stuff that'll end up in the 
</I>&gt;<i> variously implemented bin.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Removing ambiguity and mess of existing HTML and de-facto 
specifications is done in at least the following sections (I may have 
missed some):
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 2.3 (the &quot;Radio buttons&quot; part)
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 2.9
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 2.14
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 2.15 (the &quot;max&quot; part)
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 2.18
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 4.1
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 4.2
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 5.2
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 5.6
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 7.1 (the &quot;accept&quot; part)
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 7.2.1
*   Web Forms 2.0 section 8 (its introduction)
*   Web Applications 1.0 section 1.8
*   Web Applications 1.0 section 2
*   Web Applications 1.0 section 6.4
*   Web Applications 1.0 section 7
*   Web Applications 1.0 section 8.5
*   Web Applications 1.0 section 10.2.

Do you have any specific suggestions for ambiguity-and-mess removal, 
other than that already done in those sections?
