</I>
Oops. Fixed. My mail client is Pine running on a remote server using SSH. 
It has no copy function, I just copy-and-paste out of my terminal client 
into another terminal client running ssh showing Emacs running on a remote 
server...


&gt;<i> &gt; The reason for both is the same -- it would mean changing how HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content is parsed in ways that could affect existing content. I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see how to concisely explain this in a useful manner before 2.18. Do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have any suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something like:
</I>&gt;<i> *   &quot;The form element is therefore allowed in the head element of XHTML
</I>&gt;<i>     documents, although only when the form element is empty. (This does
</I>&gt;<i>     not apply to HTML, where a &lt;code&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag has always
</I>&gt;<i>     implied the end of any unclosed &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element and the
</I>&gt;<i>     beginning of the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;.)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> *   &quot;Similarly, form elements in XHTML may now be nested (this does not
</I>&gt;<i>     apply to HTML, where a &lt;code&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag has always
</I>&gt;<i>     implied the end of any unclosed &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; element).&quot;
</I>
Good good. Taken. (With minor adjustments to the second.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The children of a form element must be block-level elements, unless one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of the ancestors of the form element is a td, th, li, dd, or block-level
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; element other than div, in which case either block-level or inline-level
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; content is allowed (but not both).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 10. Why the exception of &lt;div&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea here is to allow certain cases that were disallowed in HTML4,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; despite being semantically adequate. The &lt;div&gt; element, however, doesn't add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any semantics, and so doesn't make the case semantically adequate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Semantically adequate for what? This will cause people to use semantic
</I>&gt;<i> elements inappropriately (most likely, use &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; for something that isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph), weakening the overall meaningfulness of the elements (for example,
</I>&gt;<i> making a word processor's paragraph count return incorrect results). As Jim
</I>&gt;<i> Ley said earlier
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2005-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2005-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> January/002798.html&gt;, HTML elements cover Web-document semantics rather than
</I>&gt;<i> application semantics, so the probability of HTML containing a non-&lt;div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> element appropriate for the meaning of any given form is near zero.
</I>
I don't really understand what you are asking for. This clause _loosens_ 
an HTML4 restriction; it allows markup that was previously invalid.

Could you give an example of what this allows that would be bad? I'm 
confused.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Authors are recommended to always have one radio button selected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Having no radio buttons selected, or more than one in a group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; selected, is considered very poor UI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 11. Why mention &quot;or more than one in a group selected&quot;? UAs don't even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     allow that (at least, not in standard HTML), so there's no point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     raising the possibility.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I can tell, this isn't true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More than one in a group selected is not allowed (only the last is selected)
</I>&gt;<i> in Internet Explorer 6 for Windows (and therefore presumably other
</I>&gt;<i> Trident-based browsers), Internet Explorer 5.2 for Mac (and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> presumably also MSN for Mac), Firefox 1.0 (and therefore presumably other
</I>&gt;<i> Gecko-based browsers), Safari 1.2.4 (and therefore presumably other
</I>&gt;<i> KHTML-based browsers), Opera 7.0 for Windows, and Opera 5.0 for Mac. What
</I>&gt;<i> browser are you using that allows it?
</I>
Huh. Indeed. Good catch! I wonder how I had found the opposite to be true.

Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; 2.5. Extensions to existing  attributes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     UAs must now support the accesskey attribute on select elements.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Second, this removes the ability of a UA implementor to implement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     type-ahead find as a more reliable (since some authors will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     specify accesskeys and some won't) and quicker (especially if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     number of items in the menu is large) way of selecting an item
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     with the keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand how.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If they implemented type-ahead find for &lt;select&gt;, it would be dangerous to
</I>&gt;<i> also implement accesskey for &lt;select&gt;, as typing letters would occasionally do
</I>&gt;<i> something both momentous and unexpected -- activating an item instead of
</I>&gt;<i> highlighting a possibly-different item.
</I>
Wouldn't that depend on exactly how accesskey is implemented? i.e. the UA 
can be written in such a way that this does not occur.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 20. I dread the thought of any author reading the spec (or reading a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     tutorial written by someone who has read the spec, etc) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     thinking that &quot;The expected format is:&quot; should be standard text
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     for their title=s!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     *   &quot;The expected format is:&quot; --&gt; &quot;A part number is&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, but is the &quot;:&quot; really necessary? It makes the message look
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily artificial (as if assembled by a computer program).
</I>
I used your text verbatim. :-)

Colon removed.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The value of the attribute, if set, should be autofocus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 28. &quot;autofocus&quot; here is linked to the attribute definition, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     wrong, because you are referring here to the value rather than to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     the attribute itself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Over-enthusiastic cross-referencing by the postprocessor I mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another I missed: &quot;Setting the DOM attribute to true sets the content
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to the value _autofocus_.&quot;
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     For textarea elements containing tags in HTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     The tags should be parsed as character data, but entities and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     comments should be recognised and handled correctly. (This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     doesn't apply to XHTML.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 34. Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because we can't change XML parsing rules.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, &quot;(This doesn't apply to XHTML because it would contravene XML parsing
</I>&gt;<i> rules.)&quot;
</I>
That works.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 38. *   &quot;an attribute&quot; --&gt; &quot;a name or id attribute&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it really is any attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's the use case for performing such processing on a non-name/id attribute?
</I>
There's an example of using this with value=&quot;&quot; in:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/demos/repeat-01/">http://www.whatwg.org/demos/repeat-01/</A>


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 40. If the template is inserted before the block in which the button
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     is found, then the button itself (like the rest of its block) will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     (in left-to-right text) move downward and/or rightward. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     usually won't matter mousewise, because a newly-created add button
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     usually will appear exactly where the just-clicked one was; but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     will still look odd in those environments where buttons are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     focusable -- because focus will appear to have jumped, as a result
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     of a click, to something that is nevertheless not under the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     cursor. If adding several blocks consecutively, there may be more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     annoying effects for accessibility aids, since the mouse is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     repeatedly encountering newly-created buttons with identical text,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     rather than continuously hovering over the same button.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Therefore, it would be better for the template to be inserted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     after the block instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then you have no way of inserting something at the top.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But right now you have no way of inserting something at the bottom!
</I>
Yes you do, a type=&quot;add&quot; outside of repetition blocks.


&gt;<i> Perhaps for this reason, in all real-world examples I know of where each 
</I>&gt;<i> repetition block has its own add and remove buttons, the add button adds 
</I>&gt;<i> a row after the current one rather than before it. These examples are 
</I>&gt;<i> the Smart Playlist dialog in iTunes, the Find window in the Mac OS X 
</I>&gt;<i> Finder, the Rule editor in Apple Mail, and the Advanced Junk settings 
</I>&gt;<i> dialog also in Apple Mail. (The accessibility reason given above doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> apply to these cases quite so much, since -- as I mentioned earlier -- 
</I>&gt;<i> Full Keyboard Access is off by default in OS X.)
</I>
Hmm, interesting point.

Ok, &quot;add&quot; now adds after the current row. Now the only way to insert at 
the top of a set of repetition blocks is to add a blank row and move it to 
the top.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 42. I propose that &quot;move&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; August/001634.html&gt; be introduced now, instead of &quot;move-up&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;move-down&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sorry, but &quot;move&quot; is simply WAY too complicated. A real implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would want to do cool things like sliding elements in and out of the way as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you drag the other element above it,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are iTunes and the Windows Start menu not &quot;real implementations&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> rearrangable items, then?
</I>
Fair point.


&gt;<i> &gt; would need to support both keyboard- and mouse- driven interaction,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I said: &quot;And on platforms (or in accessibility situations) where
</I>&gt;<i> focusing it was appropriate, it could be focused so a row could be moved up or
</I>&gt;<i> down with the arrow keys.&quot;
</I>
Right. More complexity.


&gt;<i> &gt; would need to implement all kinds of funky things in the rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engine (e.g. how to handle a drag when the elements in question are in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a 0.5 opacity block rotated 47 degrees
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Implementation complexity circa 2005: use a dragging-in-progress cursor.
</I>
That doesn't solve the problem of working out where the drop is going to 
go. It's not trivial, and it's a real problem.


&gt;<i> &gt; and passed through three SVG filters),
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but is native SVG support a requirement 
</I>&gt;<i> for implementing Web Forms 2? If so, that should be noted in the spec. 
</I>&gt;<i> If not, why will it be any great catastrophe that the SVG plug-in 
</I>&gt;<i> produced by Bill McCoy's colleagues at Adobe doesn't support Web Forms 2 
</I>&gt;<i> in its embedded HTML either?
</I>
The browsers that are looking at implementing Web Forms 2 are already 
implementing SVG.


&gt;<i> &gt; I agree it's a good idea. I disagree that it is simple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With respect, you did a particularly poor job of making it seem complex.
</I>
I'm not trying to &quot;make it seem complex&quot;. It _is_ complex. WF2 is going to 
be hard enough to implement without requiring implementors to find 
solutions to the problems I listed and trying to implement what you 
described. The move-up and move-down buttons can be implemented in a few 
hours if not less. The &quot;move&quot; idea, while orders of magnitude better, 
would take days, if not weeks.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; D. Requirements for declaring interoperability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 54. The sections listed in this section should be hyperlinked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, that would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, er, why not do it? :-)
</I>
Because at the time my hands were hurting and setting up links is a 
typing-intensive process.
