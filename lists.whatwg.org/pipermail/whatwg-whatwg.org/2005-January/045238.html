I have seen, and used, forms where the author had one form per row, 
hacked using &lt;form&gt; elements in invalid places. There are cases where that 
is the UI that people want.


&gt;<i> The other use case is quite realistic though, and shows a genuine need

</I>&gt;<i> there are validation constraints on the fields, neither solution works.
</I>
I agree it's not perfect.


&gt;<i> For example, the product-code field would typically be required with 
</I>&gt;<i> respect to the main form, but optional with respect to the lookup form, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the reverse might be the case with the product-name field.
</I>
Yeah, I've considered doing things like:

   required=&quot;form1 form2&quot;

...to mean that the field was required for those particular forms. But I 
don't really like that idea. I'm not sure what else to do (short of JS to 
change the requiredness, which is what XForms effectively does).

I agree that form=&quot;&quot; is not the perfect solution. But it does address use 
cases that people have asked for, and it is reasonably simple. If we want 
to get rid of it, we have to find something better, and so far I haven't 
seen or come up with any better proposals, unfortunately.
