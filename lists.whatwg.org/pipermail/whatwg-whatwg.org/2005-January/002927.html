Yes, that was the part I didn't understand :-)
The spec just describes how escape and embed the dataset in the URI, and 
then it says: &quot;Then, access the resulting URI&quot;. But what does it mean to 
access a data URI?

You are right, undefined is a bad idea.
However, by describing specific rules for how to handle data-URI, the 
spec gives the impression that this scheme is somehow a useful feature. 
If I understand you correctly, you are saying that the data-scheme is 
not really useful as an action target, and that its only described in 
the spec for completeness? In that case, there are many other schemes 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes</A>&gt; that authors could 
theoretically use in an action-attribute.

Maybe the spec could just say that the form throws a 
URI_SCHEME_NOT_SUPPORTED exception when an unsupported scheme is used.
