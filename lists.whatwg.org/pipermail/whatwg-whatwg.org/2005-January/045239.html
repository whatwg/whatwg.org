True. Authors will effectively be forced to have a &lt;form id=&quot;rowNNN/&gt; in 
the first column of each row, and then have form=&quot;rowNNN&quot; on each form 
control. Not perfect, but we can't really change the &lt;table&gt; content model 
(table parsing is already a house of cards, making it worse is a legacy 
content minefield).


&gt;<i> But maybe its just because I understand the semantics of the form

The beauty (?) of the Web Forms 2 definition is that you can use either 
model, as you see fit.
