<PRE>Some (mostly) nitpicky comments on the last call for comments draft (I 
checked that all issues are still present in the current draft).

section 2.4:
    &quot;if (event.target.time1.value &amp;gt;= event.target.time2.value) {&quot;
--&gt; if (event.target.time1.value &lt;= event.target.time2.value) {

section 2.4.2:
    &quot;The following control would only allow selection of any Sunday in 
any year from 1900:&quot;
--&gt; The following control would only allow selection of any Sunday in 
any year from 1900 onward:

section 2.15:
    &quot;There is currently no way to specify an unlimited number of files 
may be uploaded&quot;
--&gt; There is currently no way to specify that an unlimited number of 
files may be uploaded

section 3.1.1:
    &quot;The concept of hierarchy is expected to be represented in the 
names, as it is manually-created repeating forms&quot;
--&gt; The concept of hierarchy is expected to be represented in the names, 
as it is in manually-created repeating forms

section 3.1.2:
    &quot;In HTML4-compliant UAs that do not implement this specification, 
the template acts as an initial blank row, and the &quot;add&quot; and &quot;remove&quot;, 
buttons cause the form to be submitted&quot;
Maybe note that this is only true for button type=&quot;add&quot;, not for input 
type=&quot;add&quot;?

section 3.2:
    &quot;In order to implement such a form declaratively&quot;
It's been several paragraphs since a form of any kind has been 
described, and in fact, forms aren't the only use for this. This looks 
like an overenthusiastic copy/paste somewhere in the dim past.
--&gt; In order to implement the repetition model declaratively

section 6.1:
    &quot;Note 1:&quot;
As there is no second note, perhaps this should just be &quot;Note:&quot;?
And actually, when I read // see note 1 below, I found myself scanning 
down for the kind of green text that denotes all other notes. Is there a 
reason this one isn't marked up as such?
