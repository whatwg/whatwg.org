Considering the current fallback of date requires bucketfuls of
script, I don't see that as a particularly relevant problem.

This could equally be considered an advantage - seen as the WF2 has a
controlled submission format, it now gives the fallback behaviour
consistent results.

So replacing the vast majority of date entry widgets on the web today
is not a use case of the input type=&quot;date&quot; it's specifically for the
much rarer case of input type=date.

Can I say that failing to address the use case currently implemented
with select boxes would be a terrible failing of WF2, it's a much
commoner use case than the single text entry box.

&gt;<i> ...not to mention the extra complexity and the implementation difficulty

</I>
How do you know how much harder it is to implement?  This is a
valuable feature, leave it in, during the implementation phase we can
find out how difficult it is to implement.  It's very disappointing to
have features (which I believe are simple to implement, certainly on
any codebases I'm likely to implement this on) denied simply because
the editor of the spec, and no-one else, believes it to be hard.

Jim.
