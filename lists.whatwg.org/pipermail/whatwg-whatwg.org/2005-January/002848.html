    The difference is that &quot;green&quot; is meaningless, where as &lt;sub&gt; is 
vital to properly communicate vital information, such as in the case of 
chemical formulas. For instance, an aural browser could intelligently 
recognize mathematical and chemical formulas and say them in a way that 
better communicates their meaning. In this situation &quot;H two O&quot; could 
potentially be pronounced &quot;dihydrogen monoxide&quot; or &quot;water&quot;. Something 
like &quot;green&quot; has no such use, and &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; can at best be said to 
change the tone of pronunciation rather than what is actually said by 
the aural browser.

&gt;&gt;<i>It's not ideal,  and for a better aural rendering you would use a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, in the case of ChemML that wouldn't help -- as far as I know

</I>&gt;<i> standard way of pronouncing chemical formulas so as to distinguish 
</I>&gt;<i> subscripts even from normal numbers. So using aural rendering to decide 
</I>&gt;<i> whether an element is semantic wouldn't work in that case.
</I>
    Semantics don't disappear simply because there's no standardized 
pronunciation. What it seems like you're saying is that there is, in 
fact, an opportunity to establish such a standard using aural browsers.
