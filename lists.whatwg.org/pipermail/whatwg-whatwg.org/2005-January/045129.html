Yes, people have lots of fun trying to find the correct markup for this 
situation. &lt;<A HREF="http://simplebits.com/notebook/2004/04/20/sq.html">http://simplebits.com/notebook/2004/04/20/sq.html</A>&gt;

The general problem is that people want to number (or, less commonly, 
bullet) series of items that are already in multi-element structures, 
such that &lt;ol&gt;/&lt;ul&gt; cannot be used. Here, if numbering were not 
required, you would arguably be using &lt;dl&gt; (since each section is a 
full definition of the instruction given in its first line), but &lt;dt&gt;s 
can't be numbered automatically solely with HTML. The same applies to a 
formal dictionary where definitions &lt;dd&gt; for each term should be 
numbered. And the same applies to a table where each row &lt;tr&gt; should be 
numbered.

You could use CSS counters, but that's a presentation answer to a 
content problem; the numbers are vital information even when CSS is 
unavailable or disabled. Similarly, it is occasionally necessary to 
start from a number other than 1 (so as to quote only some clauses from 
a statute, for example), and/or to change the list numbering partway 
through (so as to omit step 2 from a business plan, for example), just 
like you can with &lt;ol&gt;, without inserting CSS into your markup. (And 
yes, the only browser to support CSS counters is Opera -- but that 
itself isn't a fair argument against using them, since immediate 
support for any newly-invented markup would be even worse.)

I was going to suggest listtype= and liststart= attributes, to be 
applied to any element (e.g. &lt;tbody&gt;) whose children you want treated 
as a list, along with a listvalue= attribute for altering numbering of 
children within the list itself. But then I realized that wouldn't work 
for &lt;dd&gt;, because the container(s) surrounding a definition term or 
terms, and the definition datum or data, are never explicit.

Then I was going to suggest a &lt;list&gt; element, with the same attributes 
as &lt;ol&gt;, and the difference that it can be placed around any elements 
you want treated as a list. But putting that around every set of &lt;dd&gt;s 
in a &lt;dl&gt; would still be annoying.

So, um, I don't know. Perhaps listtype=, liststart=, listfor=, and 
listresetafter=? For example, &lt;dl listfor=&quot;dd&quot; listresetafter=&quot;dt&quot; 
listtype=&quot;a&quot;&gt;.
