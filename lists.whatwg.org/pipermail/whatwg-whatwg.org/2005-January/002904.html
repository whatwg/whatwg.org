<PRE>Yes, I agree.  We have been brainstorming XUL2 for some time now, and 
much of what you have suggested is in our list.

Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i>Yes I greatly admire XUL and Firefox has become my home browser and is in
</I>&gt;<i>danger of becoming my work browser so I accept that it's
</I>&gt;<i>industrial-strength. For widgets &amp; layout of GUI chrome, XUL is clearly a
</I>&gt;<i>reasonable approach. And a pure XForms+SVG implementation would lack that
</I>&gt;<i>layer of widget-level markup and associating formatting capabilities
</I>&gt;<i>(springs/struts etc.). You need dynamic layouts not just fixed-format which
</I>&gt;<i>is SVG's forte. And you need more than generic controls like &lt;xf:select1&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I've never written more than toy XUL programs, so I greatly  hesitate to
</I>&gt;<i>comment on XUL, especially to you Dave. But FWIW I believe XUL has suffered
</I>&gt;<i>from not having a rich imaging model underneath it, so despite innovating
</I>&gt;<i>XBL and the &quot;shadow tree&quot; concept, and receiving the flattery of imitation
</I>&gt;<i>by Flash Flex, XAML, and others, XUL itself was/is a bit constrained, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>in terms of what custom widgets can be created within the architecture (vs.
</I>&gt;<i>natively). SVG/sXBL could fix this part. XUL also suffers from not having a
</I>&gt;<i>strong built-in way to reference and bind from presentation layer to XML
</I>&gt;<i>data models, and to define constraints on the data models rather than at the
</I>&gt;<i>presentation level, in order to foster creation of declarative model-view
</I>&gt;<i>solutions. XForms fixes this and I believe there's no conflict that would
</I>&gt;<i>impair richness of XUL in combination (I believe David Birbeck has a version
</I>&gt;<i>of formsPlayer that is based on XUL skins). XForms is not a complete
</I>&gt;<i>solution, it's intended to be embedded in a hosting markup, and the
</I>&gt;<i>intention is that abstract widgets like &lt;xf:select1&gt; could have styling
</I>&gt;<i>performed on them to specify as rich a visualization as an author could
</I>&gt;<i>want, including selection of a preferred concrete (XUL-style) widget
</I>&gt;<i>instantiation. Because styling is dependent on the host language this is not
</I>&gt;<i>spec'd in XForms itself, but this is certainly the vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There are some other &quot;interesting&quot; characteristics of original XUL, like the
</I>&gt;<i>ways it uses RDF and to some extent particulars of its integration with CSS,
</I>&gt;<i>but it is a pioneering technology and rough edges are natural. The term
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;XUL&quot; is, interestingly, starting to be genericized to refer to any &quot;XML
</I>&gt;<i>User Interface Language&quot; even things like XForms and XAML (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>xulplanet.org's &quot;XUL Grand Coding Challenge&quot; included many solutions that
</I>&gt;<i>were not XUL compatible at all). In that spirit it would seem interesting to
</I>&gt;<i>consider creating a &quot;XUL 2.0&quot; (much more so than further Street HTML
</I>&gt;<i>bolt-ons for desktop apps). Even though it might not end up strictly XUL 1.0
</I>&gt;<i>compatible that doesn't seem to be a big issue (XUL 1.0 barring a few
</I>&gt;<i>experimental efforts is basically used for Mozilla-based browser chrome not
</I>&gt;<i>full-scale standalone apps). And, per other posts, make such a XUL 2.0 a
</I>&gt;<i>real open standard not just a single-browser technology. But, again, such a
</I>&gt;<i>XUL 2.0 should IMO either integrate or be complementary to SVG for
</I>&gt;<i>declarative imaging model richness and XForms for declarative data model
</I>&gt;<i>richness. Pursuing this of course would help head off over-complexification
</I>&gt;<i>of SVG by people trying to make *it* into a complete app environment
</I>&gt;<i>(bolting-on to Street HTML isn't the only idea I personally have a hard time
</I>&gt;<i>getting on board with).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And while we people may denigrate the device independence / multi-modality
</I>&gt;<i>that the model-view separation of XForms fosters, it is a reality that
</I>&gt;<i>global enterprises are increasingly specifying that solutions be mobilized
</I>&gt;<i>and accessible.
