&gt;<i> I still fail to see what the compelling use case is.
</I>
Selecting the input mode is quite common for applications which are to run 
on mobile phones, PDAs or other devices where you only have a limited 
keyboard. If you can tell that a field should contain a telephone number, the 
user can then be able to enter the phone number directly using the phone's 
number pad (if there is one), instead of having to go through a complicated 
IME (compare how complicated it is to enter latin text on a phone keypad, 
and then extend that thought to the Japanese and Chinese writing 
systems...).

Of course, as others have pointed out, most of this could probably be 
handled quite intelligently by the UA by looking at the expected data type 
and data pattern of the input element.
