Thanks for the changes.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2.3. Changes to existing controls
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Specifically, the form, legend, select, and optgroup elements may

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 8.  *   &quot;However, with the exception of the form element, authors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         should avoid allowing any of these elements to be both empty

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         confuse users.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair point.
</I>
Thanks. Now, &quot;likely to confuse &gt; users&quot; --&gt; &quot;likely to confuse users&quot;.  
(And get yourself an e-mail client with a smarter Copy function.;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, as controls no longer need to be contained within their form
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> element to be associated with it, authors may prefer to declare their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> forms in advance, at the top of their documents. The form element is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> therefore allowed in the head element of XHTML documents, although
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> only when the form element is empty. (This does not apply to HTML.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Similarly, form elements in XHTML may now be nested (this does not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> apply to HTML).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 9.  Why don't these apply to HTML? The explanation of the former is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     buried waaaay down in a parenthesis in section 2.18. There doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     seem to be an explanation of the latter at all. It would be nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     if these were explained more promptly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for both is the same -- it would mean changing how HTML  
</I>&gt;<i> content is parsed in ways that could affect existing content. I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> see how to concisely explain this in a useful manner before 2.18. Do  
</I>&gt;<i> you have any suggestions?
</I>
Something like:
*   &quot;The form element is therefore allowed in the head element of XHTML
     documents, although only when the form element is empty. (This does
     not apply to HTML, where a &lt;code&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag has always
     implied the end of any unclosed &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element and the
     beginning of the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;.)&quot;
*   &quot;Similarly, form elements in XHTML may now be nested (this does not
     apply to HTML, where a &lt;code&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag has always
     implied the end of any unclosed &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt; element).&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The children of a form element must be block-level elements, unless  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one of the ancestors of the form element is a td, th, li, dd, or  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> block-level element other than div, in which case either block-level  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or inline-level content is allowed (but not both).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10. Why the exception of &lt;div&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea here is to allow certain cases that were disallowed in HTML4,
</I>&gt;<i> despite being semantically adequate. The &lt;div&gt; element, however,  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't add any semantics, and so doesn't make the case semantically  
</I>&gt;<i> adequate.
</I>
Semantically adequate for what? This will cause people to use semantic  
elements inappropriately (most likely, use &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; for something that  
isn't a paragraph), weakening the overall meaningfulness of the  
elements (for example, making a word processor's paragraph count return  
incorrect results). As Jim Ley said earlier  
&lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2005-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2005-</A> 
January/002798.html&gt;, HTML elements cover Web-document semantics rather  
than application semantics, so the probability of HTML containing a  
non-&lt;div&gt; element appropriate for the meaning of any given form is near  
zero.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Authors are recommended to always have one radio button selected.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Having no radio buttons selected, or more than one in a group
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> selected, is considered very poor UI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 11. Why mention &quot;or more than one in a group selected&quot;? UAs don't even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     allow that (at least, not in standard HTML), so there's no point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     raising the possibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, this isn't true.
</I>
More than one in a group selected is not allowed (only the last is  
selected) in Internet Explorer 6 for Windows (and therefore presumably  
other Trident-based browsers), Internet Explorer 5.2 for Mac (and  
therefore presumably also MSN for Mac), Firefox 1.0 (and therefore  
presumably other Gecko-based browsers), Safari 1.2.4 (and therefore  
presumably other KHTML-based browsers), Opera 7.0 for Windows, and  
Opera 5.0 for Mac. What browser are you using that allows it?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 2.5. Extensions to existing  attributes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     UAs must now support the accesskey attribute on select elements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Second, this removes the ability of a UA implementor to implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     type-ahead find as a more reliable (since some authors will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     specify accesskeys and some won't) and quicker (especially if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     number of items in the menu is large) way of selecting an item
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with the keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand how.
</I>
If they implemented type-ahead find for &lt;select&gt;, it would be dangerous  
to also implement accesskey for &lt;select&gt;, as typing letters would  
occasionally do something both momentous and unexpected -- activating  
an item instead of highlighting a possibly-different item.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably the new wording solves this.
</I>
Yes, thanks.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 20. I dread the thought of any author reading the spec (or reading a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     tutorial written by someone who has read the spec, etc) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     thinking that &quot;The expected format is:&quot; should be standard text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     for their title=s!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *   &quot;The expected format is:&quot; --&gt; &quot;A part number is&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fixed.
</I>
Thanks, but is the &quot;:&quot; really necessary? It makes the message look  
unnecessarily artificial (as if assembled by a computer program).

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The value of the attribute, if set, should be autofocus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 28. &quot;autofocus&quot; here is linked to the attribute definition, which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     wrong, because you are referring here to the value rather than to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the attribute itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over-enthusiastic cross-referencing by the postprocessor I mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i> Fixed.
</I>
Another I missed: &quot;Setting the DOM attribute to true sets the content  
attribute to the value _autofocus_.&quot;

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rows&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cols&lt;/code&gt; attributes of the
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;code&gt;textarea&lt;/code&gt; element are no longer required attributes.
</I>&gt;<i>   When unspecified, CSS-compliant browsers should lay the element out
</I>&gt;<i>   as specified by CSS, and non-CSS UAs may use UA-specific defaults,
</I>&gt;<i>   such as, for visual UAs, using the available width on the page and a
</I>&gt;<i>   height suitable for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Good, thanks.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2.15. Extensions to file upload controls
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 32. Ehhhh. Why not just allow the value &quot;any&quot;, as is done for step=?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because it would only make sense for file uploads and I didn't want the
</I>&gt;<i> added complexity just for this one edge case. (Let's face it, there'll
</I>&gt;<i> always be a maximum here.)
</I>
Fair enough.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 33. &quot;Web logging&quot;? Some old-fashioned newspapers refer to them as &quot;Web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     logs&quot;, but they're much more commonly &quot;Weblogs&quot;. (See also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?</A> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> title=Talk%3AWeblog&amp;diff=1399541&amp;oldid=1283187&gt;.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They're most commonly referred to as &quot;blogs&quot;. &quot;Weblog&quot; seems weird to  
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
&quot;Blog&quot; is a May 1999 abbreviation of &quot;Weblog&quot;.  
&lt;<A HREF="http://peterme.com/archives/00000205.html">http://peterme.com/archives/00000205.html</A>&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For textarea elements containing tags in HTML
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     The tags should be parsed as character data, but entities and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     comments should be recognised and handled correctly. (This
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     doesn't apply to XHTML.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 34. Why not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because we can't change XML parsing rules.
</I>
So, &quot;(This doesn't apply to XHTML because it would contravene XML  
parsing rules.)&quot;

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 38. *   &quot;an attribute&quot; --&gt; &quot;a name or id attribute&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it really is any attribute.
</I>
What's the use case for performing such processing on a non-name/id  
attribute?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 40. If the template is inserted before the block in which the button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is found, then the button itself (like the rest of its block) will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (in left-to-right text) move downward and/or rightward. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     usually won't matter mousewise, because a newly-created add button
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     usually will appear exactly where the just-clicked one was; but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will still look odd in those environments where buttons are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     focusable -- because focus will appear to have jumped, as a result
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of a click, to something that is nevertheless not under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     cursor. If adding several blocks consecutively, there may be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     annoying effects for accessibility aids, since the mouse is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     repeatedly encountering newly-created buttons with identical text,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     rather than continuously hovering over the same button.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Therefore, it would be better for the template to be inserted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     after the block instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you have no way of inserting something at the top.
</I>
But right now you have no way of inserting something at the bottom!  
Wanting that is far more likely than wanting to add to the top. (&quot;Oh,  
I've run out of room for all the stuff I want to enter; I'll just add a  
few more rows.&quot;)

Perhaps for this reason, in all real-world examples I know of where  
each repetition block has its own add and remove buttons, the add  
button adds a row after the current one rather than before it. These  
examples are the Smart Playlist dialog in iTunes, the Find window in  
the Mac OS X Finder, the Rule editor in Apple Mail, and the Advanced  
Junk settings dialog also in Apple Mail. (The accessibility reason  
given above doesn't apply to these cases quite so much, since -- as I  
mentioned earlier -- Full Keyboard Access is off by default in OS X.)

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 42. I propose that &quot;move&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> August/001634.html&gt; be introduced now, instead of &quot;move-up&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;move-down&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry, but &quot;move&quot; is simply WAY too complicated. A real  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation would want to do cool things like sliding elements in  
</I>&gt;<i> and out of the way as you drag the other element above it,
</I>
Are iTunes and the Windows Start menu not &quot;real implementations&quot; of  
rearrangable items, then?

&gt;<i> would need to support both keyboard- and mouse- driven interaction,
</I>
That's why I said: &quot;And on platforms (or in accessibility situations)  
where focusing it was appropriate, it could be focused so a row could  
be moved up or down with the arrow keys.&quot;

&gt;<i> would need to implement all kinds of funky things in the rendering  
</I>&gt;<i> engine (e.g. how to handle a drag when the elements in question are in  
</I>&gt;<i> a 0.5 opacity block rotated 47 degrees
</I>
Implementation complexity circa 2005: use a dragging-in-progress  
cursor. Implementation complexity circa 2006: use a  
dragging-in-progress cursor, plus a dotted outline of the element's  
extent. Implementation complexity circa 2007: start thinking about  
maybe doing something like compositing a semi-transparent copy of the  
item for dragging. Y'know, if your UA programmers really have nothing  
better to do.

&gt;<i> and passed through three SVG filters),
</I>
Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but is native SVG support a requirement  
for implementing Web Forms 2? If so, that should be noted in the spec.  
If not, why will it be any great catastrophe that the SVG plug-in  
produced by Bill McCoy's colleagues at Adobe doesn't support Web Forms  
2 in its embedded HTML either?

&gt;<i> and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree it's a good idea. I disagree that it is simple.
</I>
With respect, you did a particularly poor job of making it seem  
complex. Nothing you just described is a requirement for an adequate  
implementation, except for keyboard access, and implementing that would  
be exactly as easy as implementing keyboard access for move-up and  
move-down.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> D. Requirements for declaring interoperability
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 54. The sections listed in this section should be hyperlinked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, that would be nice.
</I>
So, er, why not do it? :-)

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 56. The raw URIs in the JavaScript 1.3 reference, the RFC references,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and the XBL reference should all be hyperlinked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The links already point to them. It would be silly to have the same  
</I>&gt;<i> link twice, and would just look busy.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
I thought you were already having the same link twice for most of the  
references, but now I see the distinction is between static and latest  
versions. Oops.
