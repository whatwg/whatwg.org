Both this and the other point that Jim made (implied alt is hard to 
debug) strongly suggest that alt should be optional, not implied. The 
lack of an alt attribute would legitimize any inference about suitable 
alternative text that the web browser wanted to perform. Therefore it 
would remain best practice to explicitly declare alt=&quot;&quot; where the image 
is purely decorative. I expect many web developers would favor this 
approach since the validator complaining about a lack of alt=&quot;&quot; has been 
perceived as unnecessary nannying and so the requirement has widely been 
ignored. Making alt optional probably wouldn't damage accessibility as 
much as might be thought because a) bad alt text is at least as bad as 
missing alt text and b) there exist other tools that explicitly check 
documents for accessibility which could flag missing alt attributes.
