</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea here is to allow certain cases that were disallowed in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; HTML4, despite being semantically adequate. The &lt;div&gt; element, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; however, doesn't add any semantics, and so doesn't make the case 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; semantically adequate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am asking: &quot;semantically adequate&quot; for what?
</I>
For conveying the context of the form controls.


&gt;<i> In that case, I am asking: why the exception of &lt;div&gt;?
</I>
Because &lt;div&gt; doesn't add anything to the context.


&gt;<i> In that case, I am asking *for* the exception of &lt;div&gt; to be removed. 
</I>&gt;<i> This would make the spec simpler, easier to implement, and (though you 
</I>&gt;<i> may not care about this point) easier to write error-checking tools for.
</I>
The last two points are the same. All it would do is make the spec simpler 
(removing three words, hardly a huge simplification) and make it slightly 
easier to write tools to catch errors, at the cost of reducing the number 
of errors that would be caught.


&gt;<i> Last but not least, it would decrease the probability that authors would 
</I>&gt;<i> misuse semantic block elements, in exchange for a near-zero increase in 
</I>&gt;<i> people using &lt;div&gt; when they should be using something else (since, as I 
</I>&gt;<i> said, the something-elses encompassing the purposes of forms don't exist 
</I>&gt;<i> in HTML anyway).
</I>
Could you show me the markup of a case where this exception would be 
harmful?


&gt;<i> &gt; This clause _loosens_ an HTML4 restriction; it allows markup that was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previously invalid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It loosens the restriction in such a way as to leave a slanted playing 
</I>&gt;<i> field. There is now a situation where non-&lt;div&gt; block elements are 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed but &lt;div&gt; is not. That will encourage people to use non-&lt;div&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> elements when they are not appropriate.
</I>
Could you show an example?


&gt;<i> &gt; Could you give an example of what this allows that would be bad? I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that. The point is not what it allows, but what it encourages.
</I>
Ok, then can you give an example of what this encourages that would be 
bad? Because I'm quite seriously not seeing it.

Most of the time, form controls should have a &lt;p&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, or &lt;dd&gt; ancestor. 
I don't think I've ever seen a case where this would not be true, in fact. 

Of course, it might be that you and I disagree on the definition of &lt;p&gt;:

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.5. Extensions to existing  attributes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     UAs must now support the accesskey attribute on select elements.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If they implemented type-ahead find for &lt;select&gt;, it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dangerous to also implement accesskey for &lt;select&gt;, as typing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; letters would occasionally do something both momentous and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; unexpected -- activating an item instead of highlighting a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; possibly-different item.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wouldn't that depend on exactly how accesskey is implemented? i.e. the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UA can be written in such a way that this does not occur.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would count for little when pressing Enter has become an 
</I>&gt;<i> instinctive part of peoples' type-ahead-activate action.
</I>
I honestly have no idea what you mean here. When is Enter part of a 
type-ahead-activate action? The whole point of type-ahead find is that you 
don't need to hit Enter, no?



&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, &quot;add&quot; now adds after the current row. Now the only way to insert 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the top of a set of repetition blocks is to add a blank row and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move it to the top.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or to use addRepetitionBlockByIndex().
</I>
Well, yeah, scripts can always do stuff.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 42. I propose that &quot;move&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; August/001634.html&gt; be introduced now, instead of &quot;move-up&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;move-down&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; would need to implement all kinds of funky things in the rendering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; engine (e.g. how to handle a drag when the elements in question are in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 0.5 opacity block rotated 47 degrees
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Implementation complexity circa 2005: use a dragging-in-progress cursor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That doesn't solve the problem of working out where the drop is going to go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then what was the point of mentioning opacity?
</I>
Because the line from your proposal didn't take it into account.


&gt;<i> &gt; It's not trivial, and it's a real problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is why I provided a complete solution for it (with diagrams, even) 
</I>&gt;<i> in my original message.
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> December/002780.html&gt;, item 42.) It's not trivial, but it's an order of
</I>&gt;<i> magnitude less complex than (for example) HTML 3.2's &lt;area&gt; element.
</I>
I doubt it. (And &lt;area&gt; is not exactly reliably implemented.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; and passed through three SVG filters),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but is native SVG support a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; requirement for implementing Web Forms 2? If so, that should be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; noted in the spec. If not, why will it be any great catastrophe that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the SVG plug-in produced by Bill McCoy's colleagues at Adobe doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; support Web Forms 2 in its embedded HTML either?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The browsers that are looking at implementing Web Forms 2 are already 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementing SVG. ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which, in amusing contrast, is an order of magnitude *more* complex than 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 3.2's &lt;area&gt; element.
</I>
It is also a _massive_ undertaking.

Tell you what. Implement (or have someone implement) type=&quot;move&quot;, 
demonstrate that it can be done as reliably as type=&quot;move-up&quot; and 
&quot;move-down&quot;, demonstrate that it isn't a problem for small devices, and 
then I'll be happy to include it in the draft.

Given the experience I have with convincing people to implement things 
that I thought were &quot;simple&quot;, I do not feel confident that type=&quot;move&quot; 
would be implemented usefully. I'd love to be proved wrong. But I'm not 
gambling the entire repetition section on it.


&gt;<i> So is the eventual Internet Explorer 6 implementation of Web Forms 2 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to include a complete, non-plug-in implementation of SVG 
</I>&gt;<i> (constructed from nothing but HTCs and a rusty coathanger)?
</I>
SVG and WF2 are completely independent. It just happens that they will be 
implemented at the same time in several UAs, and so their interaction 
needs to be sanely defined.


&gt;<i> If not, back to my previous question: Why will it be any great 
</I>&gt;<i> catastrophe that &lt;input type=&quot;move&quot;&gt;, like the whole of the rest of Web 
</I>&gt;<i> Forms 2, is not supported in the embedded HTML of a plug-in 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of SVG?
</I>
I was talking of native implementations, not IE or plugins.


&gt;<i> And if it will not be any great catastrophe, then why are you raising 
</I>&gt;<i> the prospect of SVG filters applied to draggable items (and why did you 
</I>&gt;<i> mention opacity earlier), if not in an attempt to make &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;move&quot;&gt; seem more complex than it is?
</I>
Because in the implementations I most care about, I will end up having to 
test how they interact, and I can see from here that it will (a) not be 
implemented right and (b) will remain buggy for years, unlike the 
massively simpler idea of simply having a button.


I love the idea of type=&quot;move&quot;. It's the kind of thing I would love to put 
in WF3. But it's simply not realistic to expect WF2 implementors to spend 
the time it would require to make that feature work correctly.
