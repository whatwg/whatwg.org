The problem with this argument is that you're pretty much saying &quot;we
can't build a browser as good as IE&quot;  If you can do it in script in
IE, we don't need web-forms, we'll just do it in script, if we can
only do it in script at the moment in IE, then that's a huge
limitation in these other UA's and they really should focus on getting
them up to standard and not waste their time trying to get everyone
else to author differently to cater for the less capable user agents.

Because the technology is solving nothing that hasn't already been
solved in script (by your own definition above), what's the motivation
for it?  Web Applications are almost all script only currently, so
authors obviously aren't concerned about using script.

Jim.
