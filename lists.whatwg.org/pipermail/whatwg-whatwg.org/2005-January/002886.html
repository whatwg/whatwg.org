Case studies are relevant. Taking a case study from a vendor known to 
use poor markup and asserting that it is evidence that HTML has the 
wrong kind of semantics for Web Applications is a nonsense however 
(irrespective of whether the conclusion you happen to reach is correct). 
The interesting question the case study provokes is this: why do Google 
(and presumably others) ignore the semantic richness of HTML? Why do 
they, in 2005, use &lt;font&gt; tags when they're a totally unnecessary and 
useless construct? If we had &quot;application level semantics&quot; could we be 
at all sure that these would be used in the correct way given that many 
HTML documents (that are really documents and not applications) ignore 
the document semantics of HTML?

My answer is simply that authors see no obvious benefit from the use of 
semantic markup. Common browsers (not browsers tuned to an accessibility 
requirement) provide no mechanism to get at any of the interesting 
information in a document (and CMS systems abstract away the ugliness), 
so what's the point? Would that be different if we had &quot;application 
level semantics&quot; (I'm not sure I understand exactly what that means)? If 
so it's certianly a worthy goal. But how can we get there from here? 
I've already said that I think XML breaks too many of the things that 
web developers rely on (ability to hack together quick solutions to easy 
problems) to be very useful, so is there a way we can do better?
