Web Forms 2 normatively references one appendix from XForms, too, so it's 
longer than it looks! ;-) It is also merely an extension of HTML4, so the 
whole of HTML4 (and DOM2 HTML) should be included in the calculation as 
well. Although I suppose then one might then argue that XPath and XML 
Schema should be included in the count for XForms.

Web Forms 2.0 is mostly stable now. I wouldn't expect much change in size 
in future.

There certainly is some level in which Web Forms 2 competes with XForms, 
yes. However, they are also quite different in important ways -- WF2 is 
focused on backwards compatibility, while XForms is focused on expressing 
constraints declaratively. Naturally, this has led to very different 
specifications, with different (if overlapping) feature sets.


&gt;<i> If you are going to add 100+ pages of incremental features to the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser world, of which a major portion has already been defined by the 
</I>&gt;<i> W3C, why not build from XForms, which is an approved standard (and which 
</I>&gt;<i> is going into Mozilla), versus building something similar but different?
</I>
XForms lacks backwards compatibility with existing content. That's the 
only reason.


&gt;<i> Perhaps Web Forms started out with the goal of doing something small as 
</I>&gt;<i> minor increments to existing HTML, but now it seems to have grown into a 
</I>&gt;<i> rather large beast of its own. Also, perhaps Web Forms started when 
</I>&gt;<i> XForms had little traction and therefore could be discounted, but in 
</I>&gt;<i> 2004 interest in XForms has picked up quite a bit.
</I>
I agree.

Hopefully XForms will indeed be successful. If anything, maybe Web Forms 2 
can help with the migration (as described in WF2, section 1.5 [1]). Web 
Forms 2 merely addresses the demand from authors to improve HTML as a 
stopgap measure while WinIE6 is still so prevalent that authors feel they 
must write content that works in default installs of that browser.
