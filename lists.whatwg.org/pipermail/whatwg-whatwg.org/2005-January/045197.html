No, sorry, I can't. The discussion was heading in an other direction 
than I planned. I haven't really thought about this case. It's probably 
not useful, I guess.

&gt;<i> However making elements, or parts of them not be considered when it

</I>&gt;<i> in a visual renderer I can understand. Especially treating transparent

</I>&gt;<i> SVG-ish.
</I>
Yes, this is what I meant.

&gt;<i> I don't really know enough about how screenreaders or speech UAs work 
</I>&gt;<i> to say if this would be usefull to them, or how it would work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note though that transparent parts can be tricky when it comes to 
</I>&gt;<i> text. You probably don't want just the actual drawn pixels of the text 
</I>&gt;<i> to be clickable, but rather the general area that is covered by text. 
</I>&gt;<i> This 'general area' needs to be defined though.
</I>
Well, I can't see the problem here. If you want pointer events on the 
general area that is covered by text, than simply not define the 
proposed property that would make the element transparent to pointer 
events for transparent area's of the element?
Or am I missing something here?

&gt;<i> Also, I'm not sure if the WHATWG mailing list is the appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i> forum. This more sounds like something for the w3c CSS WG or the 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM-Events WG. Unfortunatly I don't think the DOM-Events WG (nor any 
</I>&gt;<i> other DOM WG) exists any more. 
</I>
Yes, you're right. Please, feel free (you or anyone else) to post a 
message about it there.

Regards,
Martijn
