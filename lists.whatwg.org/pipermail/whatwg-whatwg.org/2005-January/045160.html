.... Which are two separate issues, because Gmail could be using a 
&lt;title&gt; etc despite being an application.

However, Gmail requires that you log in, so search engine indexing 
isn't an issue; and Gmail engineers have trouble even supporting 
minority browsers 
&lt;<A HREF="https://gmail.google.com/gmail/browser_requirements.html">https://gmail.google.com/gmail/browser_requirements.html</A>&gt;, let alone 
understanding accessibility (see comments from Joe Clark, Mark Pilgrim 
et al. at &lt;<A HREF="http://fury.com/article/1994.php">http://fury.com/article/1994.php</A>&gt;); so it's no particular 
*further* loss that Gmail doesn't use semantic markup.

&gt;<i> - a good reason why we shouldn't be looking to take HTML beyond any 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of stop-gap measures, especially when XUL/XAML and more already 
</I>&gt;<i> exist to provide application level mark-up.
</I>
And what would be the benefit of that? Most authors don't care about 
semantics. And users do so only rarely (e.g. if they're using 
non-visual UAs) or indirectly (e.g. if they're using search engines). 
So how would any semanticity of XUL/XAML benefit users?

&gt;<i> They could however carry web document semantics to aid non visual 
</I>&gt;<i> understanding, the fact they don't isn't something that needs more 
</I>&gt;<i> specs to help.
</I>
How are those issues related? The rest of the Web needn't grind to a 
halt while we wait another decade for Google to fix their markup.

&gt;&gt;<i> If the What-WG's work increases the average fraction of any particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application that is written in HTML or XHTML rather than script and/or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arbitary XML, we do benefit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please clarify who the we are?  and why we benefit, for
</I>&gt;<i> example if the we is web application authors, then you need to talk in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of reduce development cost,  or reduced testing cost, or better
</I>&gt;<i> result to our users etc.  (I think this is very tough given the
</I>&gt;<i> IE/scripting issue.)  Or if it's web-application consumers, how do
</I>&gt;<i> they benefit.
</I>
It is quite impressive for you to have snipped my answer to your 
question and then to have asked it.

Here's the answer again: &quot;We all benefit currently, for example, from 
Amazon's and IMDb's databases showing up in Google search results -- 
which they wouldn't do if written entirely in script and/or FooML. (And 
the application hosts benefit in turn from the search engine traffic.)&quot;

&gt;<i> You're also missing one of the elements, non-arbitrary XML - For 
</I>&gt;<i> example Bill McCoy's RSS reader won't be consuming arbitrary XML.
</I>
That's not relevant. We're talking about what applications are written 
in, not about what they consume. (Anyway, the vast majority of RSS 
feeds are alternates of already-indexed HTML documents.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If the WHAT WG's aim is to discourage what they call street HTML,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No member of What-WG has called anything &quot;street HTML&quot;, on the WG's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site or (except at your insistent prompting) on this mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe I ever used the term before this post, I don't like
</I>&gt;<i> it, I don't think it's a good description of what's out there.  With a
</I>&gt;<i> WhatWG member using it and understanding it though,  I decided it was
</I>&gt;<i> part of the vocabulary and I should use it, maybe you've got my posts
</I>&gt;<i> confused with someone else?
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Yes I had, sorry. Anyway, the What-WG's aim is pretty clearly spelled 
out on their site &lt;<A HREF="http://whatwg.org/charter#deliverables">http://whatwg.org/charter#deliverables</A>&gt;, and it 
doesn't mention street HTML or any synonym. Again, though, since the 
What-WG specs already substantially disambiguate the HTML and DOM 
specs, if you have any concrete suggestions on how to do that further 
I'm sure they would be considered.
