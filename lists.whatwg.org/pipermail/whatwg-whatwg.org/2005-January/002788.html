I agree that most of the uploadable files cannot be filtered by user 
agent. In addition think that file upload dialog *hiding* images 
which don't fit certain pixel sizes would be a bad UI because users 
aren't expecting such behavior from file selection dialog. I would, 
however, support a suggestion to ask UA to scale the uploaded image 
to certain smaller size so that the file would be faster to send 
(think about a photo taken with a 8MP digital camera, for example). 
I can see two positive outcomes from this support:

1) Upload time is less than when using server side scaling
2) User gets in the charge with the scaling algorithm -- e.g. UA 
could allow the user to tweak scaling algorithm and/or JPEG 
compression parameters so that resulting image would look 
sharper/would be quicker to send. Perhaps generate three different 
versions of scaled image and let the user choose the one that looks 
the best.

&gt;<i> Another idea: how about a &quot;compress&quot; flag - the UA compresses (zip) the
</I>&gt;<i> file/s before sending - that could reduce upload time dramatically and
</I>&gt;<i> improve user experience. The document management system vendors would
</I>&gt;<i> love this feature.
</I>
How about server just sends
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate (or some other encoding)
HTTP header to the UA and UA sends everything compressed if possible?
