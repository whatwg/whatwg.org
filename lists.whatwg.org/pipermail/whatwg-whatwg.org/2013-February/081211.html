I think this is difficult to do in the general case, such as putImageData()
or drawImage() or patterns, since you would need to examine all the pixels
of the source image to determine if they contain non-1 alpha.  This would
be cost-prohibitive.

If it's just for the purposes of optimization, you could be conservative
and simply clear the flag when there's the potential for (but not certainty
of) non-1 alpha.  But if you're also using that flag to allow subpixel AA,
the behaviour becomes quite unpredictable for the web developer and hard to
spec crisply.

We could consider separating the two concepts again.  In an earlier thread,
there was an attempt to automatically determine all the places where it's
safe to enabled subpixel AA, but that seemed to result in a complex
implementation, with all cases still not being covered (such as
canvas-to-canvas drawImage()). The other alternative is programmatic
control over subpixel AA, using a context attribute. That was the first
thing that Justin proposed in the earlier thread, and would be my
preference as well (a fully-loaded footgun:  you can shoot yourself with
it, but the behaviour and performance characteristics are very easy to
understand and spec).  But there didn't seem to be agreement around that
either.

Which is how I ended up at the &quot;moz-opaque&quot; flag.  it restricts canvas to
the subset of operations which result in a 1 alpha in the backing store, to
allow optimizations and the use of subpixel AA.  I think that is actually
quite a useful subset (generally, the subset that doesn't need destination
alpha).  I believe the same thing can be achieved in WebGL by setting the
&quot;alpha&quot; attribute to false in WebGLContextAttributes.
