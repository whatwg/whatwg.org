</I>
This argument appears to apply equally well to all the date inputs,
and perhaps most of the other new inputs.  I believe it's wrong.

* Most people don't type very fast.  We email-happy people are an
exception.  For most, clicking on things is faster and easier.
* Experience shows that most authors appear to prefer a pair of
dropdowns for selecting month and year, rather than a text input.
Might as well move closer to author expectations.
* Text inputs are permanently subject to the vagaries of whatever
arcane syntax the author happened to want (or didn't want, but
accidentally required when they miswrote their regex) - Do I just type
two numbers with a slash? Or do I use a dash? Or a space?  What if I
use a slash surrounded by spaces? Or do I use the month name? Long or
short name? Two digit or four digit year? - while visual inputs put
your options in front of you and avoid all of that.

&gt;<i> Even if &lt;input type=month&gt; became widely supported, many, probably most,
</I>&gt;<i> authors will keep using libraries or their own code, because they get
</I>&gt;<i> consistent look and feel and functionality across browsers. Some authors
</I>&gt;<i> would be misled into using &lt;input type=month&gt; for any month input because
</I>&gt;<i> that's &quot;logical&quot; or &quot;semantic&quot; (as it is in a sense), but this will create
</I>&gt;<i> questionable user experience in many common cases.
</I>
This same argument keeps getting deployed against type=&quot;date&quot;.  We'll
see what actually happens.  I expect (and deeply hope) that the ease
of use of the built-ins will win the day, once they're supported on
every browser sites expect their visitors to use.
