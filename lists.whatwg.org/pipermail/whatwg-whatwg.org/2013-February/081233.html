</I>&gt;&gt;<i> safe at the time of drawing, there's no guarantee that it will be safe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later.  For instance, if you then drawImage() that canvas rotated into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another canvas, or even just full-page-zoom it, you'll see colour fringing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or apply CSS 2D or 3D transforms. There are also existing apps which use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> canvas for 2D text glyphs, and then transform and place them rotated in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WebGL. Those will show colour fringing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This came up on the list earlier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even within canvas, there may be a way to break it if the LCD AA text is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drawn first and a dest-alpha compositing mode is used overtop (I haven't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verified this though).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that's a problem. All destination alpha values will be 1
</I>&gt;<i> even after the subpixel AA test is painted, and you'll treat it as normal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was thinking something like this:

- draw subpixel AA text over an opaque background
- draw a partially-transparent rect with destination-atop mode over the
subpixel AA text

Now some of the subpixel AA text is still there, but the destination alpha
is non-1, so things will go bad when you composite into the page.  (At
least I think it will.. Porter-Duff makes my head spin sometimes.)


&gt;<i>  So I'm starting to think that LCD AA text really has to be opt-in, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoid breaking existing content. By opting it, you're agreeing that these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> artifacts are acceptable for your app. For example, you know that even if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're going to do a canvas-to-canvas draw, you're always going to draw at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1:1 scale and no rotation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's difficult to know that on a mobile browser or any other browser where
</I>&gt;<i> you have some kind of fast zoom UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The suggestion on the list earlier was to keep two versions of the canvas
</I>&gt;<i> buffer: one with grayscale AA, another with subpixel AA, and composite with
</I>&gt;<i> the subpixel AA buffer when we can do that safely, otherwise use the
</I>&gt;<i> grayscale AA version. In many implementations there would be a performance
</I>&gt;<i> hit for this, so it would make sense to have authors opt-in to that
</I>&gt;<i> performance hit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It would also be a needless performance hit if the developer knew that they
always wanted subpixel AA, and that their app would never fringe.

So let me take a stab at a brief summary of the proposals so far, and the
pros and cons of each (correct me if I missed anything):

moz-opaque
pro:  fairly easy to implement
pro:  no performance hit over regular rendering
pro:  many opportunities for optimization
pro:  catches all in-canvas cases of color fringing
con:  does not handle any out-of-canvas color fringing
con:  opt-in

automatic opacity detection
pro:  catches most (all?) cases of in-canvas color fringing
pro:  some opportunties for optimization (must be conservative in some
cases)
con:  does not catch color fringing on CSS transforms, canvas -&gt; WebGL, etc

context attribute (something like:  context.textAntialising = { 'none',
'grayscale', 'subpixel' })
pro:  very easy to implement
pro:  no performance hit
con:  does not catch any cases of color fringing; completely up to web
developer
con:  opt-in

deferred canvas rendering (collect commands into a buffer, flush buffer
only when compositing canvas to page, and decide on subpixel AA at that
point)
pro:  catches all cases of color fringing
con:  in some cases, requires an infinite buffer (e.g., a canvas that never
clears, and only accumulates drawing frame-to-frame means you must
accumulate commands indefinitely)
con:  difficult to implement (e.g., canvas-to-canvas drawImage(), etc)
con:  may introduce performance hit due to re-rendering with and without
subpixel AA (in cases where you would rather have just gone without)

two buffers (one grayscale, one LCD AA)
pro:  handles all cases of color fringing
pro:  moderately easy to implement
con:  RAM (or VRAM) usage is doubled
con:  possibly-unnecessary performance hit
con:  must be opt-in
