</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; For blending optimizations, it might be better to introduce a function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; instead of a boolean attribute like 'opaque'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What you really want, is to matte [1] the canvas with a solid color so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you can optimize compositing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; How about this API:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; void applyMatte(DOMString color); // color is a CSS rgb color value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (alpha is ignored)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When you call this function, the canvas is matted with that color. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it's the first drawing call, you can just fill the canvas with that
</I>&gt;<i> color
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (no compositing needed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; After matting, you no longer have to read or update the alpha channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; since it's always 1 which should speed up drawing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just to be sure we're on the same page, when I mentioned compositing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optimizations, I was referring to compositing the canvas backing store
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the page, not compositing operations within the canvas itself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sorry, I didn't mean to say blending. This is for optimizing compositing
</I>&gt;<i> within the canvas and of the canvas into the page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One advantage of using an element attribute is that it could be used at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backing store allocation time, to allocate RGB instead of RGBA.  Forcing
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reallocation of the backing store on attribute change would be consistent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with changing width and height of the canvas, which have the same effect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Doing so on a context operation would not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> why not? There is no reason for you to allocate the backing store until
</I>&gt;<i> it's needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True.  I was just trying to understand when you would use this function
more than once during canvas lifetime.  Presumably, that's the reason for
having a function, no?  If so, and you don't maintain any special state
about the opacity of the canvas, how is this different from an rgb()
fillRect()?


&gt;<i> The strange thing with an element attribute is that you can't change it
</I>&gt;<i> back and it's also detached from the JS code that does the drawing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You can change it back programmatically through the DOM, as you can with
the element width and height.


&gt;<i> &gt; If we did use a context function approach as you suggest, how would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subpixel AA be handled?  Would it be enabled on first call of the
</I>&gt;<i> function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and never disabled?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did not think about subpixel AA.
</I>&gt;<i> If I read the mozilla proposal correctly, they do AA if they know that the
</I>&gt;<i> canvas is opaque.
</I>&gt;<i> So, with my proposal, there would be no AA until you call 'applyMatte'
</I>&gt;<i> (assuming you follow the mozilla way of doing AA).
</I>

OK, so there would have to be a bit of state saved at that point, in order
to know if subpixel AA is allowable?

At any rate, I don't think this works if you subsequently modify the
canvas's alpha (see below).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a way to query if the canvas is opaque once it's called?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't the user know that he called 'applyMatte'? Also why do you want to
</I>&gt;<i> query it?
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  (I'm assuming that all changes to canvas alpha after the first call
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to be ignored, since otherwise you'd have to sniff every operation
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see if it affected alpha, and &quot;reset the bit&quot;, although perhaps I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; misunderstanding your proposal.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you don't have to do that and can still use alpha.
</I>&gt;<i> Simple alpha compositing is defined as follows [1] (in premultiplied
</I>&gt;<i> alpha):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> co = cs + cb x (1 - &#945;s)
</I>&gt;<i> &#945;o = &#945;s + &#945;b x (1 - &#945;s)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you know that the backdrop is matted (&#945;b = 1), the second formula always
</I>&gt;<i> resolves to 1 so you can skip it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The problem is, canvas supports more than simple (source-over) compositing,
so there are ways of modifying the destination alpha back to non-1, e.g., a
primitive with non-1 alpha drawn with source-copy, or via putImageData().
 At that point, the state of the canvas's alpha is unknown, so the page
compositor can make no assumptions about its opacity.
