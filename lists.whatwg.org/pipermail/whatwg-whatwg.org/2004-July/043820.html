    Sliders have to have a handle, and that handle has to be somewhere 
on the slider. Therefore, it has to have a value within the range. The 
default value for anything is usually zero. (In the case of sliders, it 
could also be the middle value between the |max| and |min| values.)

    You could argue it's illegal (although I have no idea why it would 
be), but that's pointless, since a control like a slider has to have a 
default value. Now that I think about it, this could be used as an 
argument why sliders shouldn't be used for &lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;&gt;, 
although I don't really by that argument myself.

&gt;<i> Sorry, I should have been more clear. The spec clearly allows &quot;maxlength&quot;

    Oops!
