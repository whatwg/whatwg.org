How was this consensus reached?  Could you at least perhaps mention
some of the other approaches considered for IE support and why they
were rejected?  This consensus was presumably reached before Dean
joined the WHAT-WG (since after that the mailing list is the place for
discussion, and there's been none)  So I'm a bit concerned that not
all the options for supporting it in IE was considered.

As I've said before, I do not feel HTC's are an appropriate mechanism
for providing this sort of support in a release environment.

&gt;<i> &gt; How are these oninvalid events dealt with in legacy FireFox, Opera,

</I>&gt;<i> thus WF2 degrades into current &quot;stupid&quot; HTML in those UAs. (This is also a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement. It has to degrade gracefully.) 
</I>
So it's the expectation of the WHAT-WG that users of  Mozilla, Safari
and Opera will get a severely degraded experience unless they upgrade
their browsers?   Well as I said before - it's one way to drive Opera
sales.

Jim.
