Of your examples, the two it didn't work for were &quot;4th July 04&quot; and 
&quot;1.091574000e+12&quot;.  Of those two, I reckon 'twould be very rare for 
anyone to type the &quot;th&quot; and expect a computer to understand; without the 
&quot;th&quot; it works fine.  The second I just didn't get the point of.  It 
isn't a date, it's a number.

&gt;<i> please also

</I>&gt;<i>machine, or even a desktop in the Bangalore office, how will the user
</I>&gt;<i>even know the local format to enter.)
</I>
Now that's just picking holes.  Your comment - to which I was replying - 
indicated that you *wanted* regional differences to be taken into 
account.  The whole point of all this is to give the user an experience 
that makes most sense to them in *their* context.

The user doesn't have to know the local format to enter if they are 
prepared to enter a non-ambiguous format.  The point of my example was 
that *if* the user _did_ enter an ambiguous format, then best one could 
do would be to guess from the locale. Microsoft's code handles 
non-ambiguous dates as you would expect, uh, non-ambiguously :-)

(Trust me, if you are trying to make a web browser in a foreign country 
work this would be the least of your worries.  Finding where the keys 
are on the keyboard is generally a bigger problem in my experience!)

PS I'd prefer replies on the list only if that's okay. thanks
