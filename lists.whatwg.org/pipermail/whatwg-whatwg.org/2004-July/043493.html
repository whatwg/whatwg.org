Way of topic. :-)

I agree. That's why I made the change.

See rule 8, though. And in the case we were looking at just now, rule 1.

Any comment about the English language is opinion, since there is no
normative reference to the language [1].


&gt;<i> Some speakers raise their voices the end of sentences where they make
</I>&gt;<i> assertions. That makes their assertions sound like questions.
</I>
Indeed, I lived many years in an area which does this.


&gt;<i> They don't exactly mean them as questions, and they would never &quot;mark
</I>&gt;<i> up&quot; their assertions with question marks to correspond with the pitch
</I>&gt;<i> change.
</I>
On the contrary, I would say that for many such speakers, they _are_
questions. The pitch is usually raised on parts of the sentence that the
speaker considers it possible for the listener to not understand, or
require further clarification about.

Given:

&quot;He went to the party, then he saw Jane, they seemed to get on well.&quot;
         raise here ^      raise here ^          don't raise here ^

The speaker is effectively saying he can provide more information about
the party and about Jane, but cannot comment further on the result.

Actually, for marking it up, I think the closest analogue would be a
hyperlink, not a question mark. Hmm. Speech hypertext?
