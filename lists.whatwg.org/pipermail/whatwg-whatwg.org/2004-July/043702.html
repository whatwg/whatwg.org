At the time I wrote it, my reference was the w3c's xhtml1 section 5.1, 
which says text/html is one of two valid mime types, as does the 
referred rfc2854:

&lt;quote&gt;
Published specification:
The text/html media type is now defined by W3C Recommendations;
the latest published version is [HTML401].  In addition, [XHTML1]
defines a profile of use of XHTML which is compatible with HTML
4.01 and which may also be labeled as text/html.
&lt;/quote&gt;

Believe me, I do care about MIME types, I even changed ISP once as one 
insisted in sending css as text/plain, which breaks several browsers.

I used XHTML as I felt using the latest HTML spec was the Right Thing 
(TM) to do - and even following appendix C it was a royal PITA to get 
the thing to look roughly the same in all the UAs I test with.

I've no intention of using a MIME type other than text/html for the 
forseeable future, if that stops IE rendering the page.

Regards,

Pete.
