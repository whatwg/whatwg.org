So every time I correct a typo or thinko in the spec, you want me to
e-mail the group saying that I corrected it, saying why I corrected it,
and saying who informed me that it was to be corrected, where they did so,
and when?

That's not going to happen. I do not have the time to waste on such
trivial pursuits. If you see a change you disagree with, then bring it up.
There is no point me wasting everyone's time saying &quot;oh by the way I
noticed that this section and this section contradicted each other so I
fixed the obviously incorrect one&quot;.


&gt;<i> This doesn't stop you deciding all this elsewhere, it just means that
</I>&gt;<i> the decisions are in the open.  At the moment, even on the list people

</I>
Every post raising an issue to this list gets a reply. (I've got a backlog
of Web Apps 1.0 issues to go through, since I haven't started working on
those yet, and I have a few days of Web Forms ones to go through still,
which I am going through as I edit the spec.)

So saying that something &quot;may or may not happen&quot; is ridiculous and,
frankly, offensive, given the lengths to which I have gone to reply to
comments, including yours.


&gt;<i> - contrast this with even the most secretive of W3 working groups, who
</I>&gt;<i> have to respond to issues.
</I>
The reality of &quot;having to reply&quot; is that many comments are rejected with
little or no comment. But the failings of the W3C process are off-topic.
