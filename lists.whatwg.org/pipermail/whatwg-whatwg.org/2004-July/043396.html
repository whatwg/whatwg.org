So it's better to have bad behaviour shipped to users, than waiting
until it's fixed?  Standards bodies don't hold implementations
hostage.

&gt;<i> In legacy clients, we don't have a fixed format for
</I>&gt;<i> submission, so we have to ensure the submitted date has a SPECIFIC one.
</I>
Which has been my point all along, yet no-one has provide a way that
legacy clients can be told the specific format without confusing the
WF2 users.  Other than your ignore element approach, but I can't find
an ignore element anywhere in the current draft, so I don't feel
that's yet appropriate.

&gt;<i>    Which, as you admit, is an arbitrary number you picked, and you've

</I>
because it reflects the complexity of the task, and how the datetime
is not IMO making the life of authors easier, which is one of the
goals of WF2.

&gt;<i>    Fine, then take your chances with Ian. I have better things to do

</I>
That's okay, Ian obviously doesn't... (well if he misses it then I can
raise it again, no point just re-posting what I've already said after
all)

Jim.
