</I>&gt;<i>    Something like that may actually lead to heavier use of &lt;link&gt; for

</I>
I said both &quot;colors and background&quot; so as to include non-plain-color 
backgrounds, yes. And most professional sites would, I think, reject 
the scheme outright if they couldn't use their logo for the link to 
their front page.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    Okay, there's a difference between saying &quot;I don't like this one 
</I>&gt;<i> thing they did with Firefox&quot; and &quot;Firefox sucks&quot;. Let's not start 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments about which browser is better.
</I>
I did not say, and do not think, that Firefox sucks or that there is 
any better browser on Windows. But if Web Apps 1.0 is going to include 
&quot;Elements for semantics commonly found in applications, such as 
&lt;byline&gt; ... &lt;navigation&gt;, etc&quot; 
&lt;<A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#requirements">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#requirements</A>&gt;, we 
*should* examine why UAs such as Firefox don't support the HTML that 
already exists for those two purposes, and why UAs such as Opera don't 
support it in a way authors can rely on. Otherwise we risk creating 
brand-new markup that suffers exactly the same fate.

Largely, I think these UAs don't support &lt;link&gt; reliably because their 
designers get stuck in the same logic you seem to have. They imagine 
the only practical implementation is a toolbar, and if it's a toolbar 
it must be hidable, and if it's hidable it should be off by default 
because it's only useful for a tiny minority of sites anyway, and hey, 
if hardly anybody uses it, why include it in the default build in the 
first place?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    People shouldn't have to have UI they don't want.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UI? We're talking about parts of a Web page here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    According to what you said before, we're talking about a bar with a 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed, largely unstyled UI that is always visible regardless of the 
</I>&gt;<i> contents web page. That sounds like browser UI to me.
</I>
I did not say it should be always visible regardless of the contents of 
the Web page. On the contrary, I said it must be &quot;reliably noticable&quot;. 
If it was visible even on pages that didn't have any &lt;link&gt;s, it would 
not be reliably noticable, because it would be inactive ~99.9 percent 
of the time, so people would get used to ignoring it.

This is easily demonstrated by trying the &lt;link&gt; toolbars in Mozilla, 
Opera, or iCab, in &quot;Always On&quot; or equivalent mode. They're useless 
unless you understand HTML -- in which case you can use the nerdiness 
of a page's design (e.g. W3C specs, useit.com, LaTeX2HTML output) as a 
hint that the page might be using &lt;link&gt;, and consciously scan the 
toolbar to confirm your suspicions. Otherwise, you eventually start 
ignoring the toolbar.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, if &lt;link&gt; elements that apply to buttons in a site 
</I>&gt;<i> navigations bar are not present, the user should not be forced to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a site navigations bar present.
</I>
That's right; it must not be present in that case.

&gt;<i>  Furthermore, &lt;a&gt; elements are common on the web. The use of &lt;link&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> for navigation is not, so most of the time the site navigations bar 
</I>&gt;<i> would go unused.
</I>
Since it wouldn't be rendered for pages that didn't use it, that 
wouldn't be a problem.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> From the HTML 4.01 spec:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;Although LINK has no content, it conveys relationship information 
</I>&gt;<i> that may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a 
</I>&gt;<i> tool-bar with a drop-down menu of links).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Notice the use of the word &quot;may&quot;. That means that rendering &lt;link&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> is optional.
</I>
&quot;May&quot; does not mean &quot;both must and must not, configurable by the user&quot;. 
For example, it's not compulsory for UAs to render &lt;b&gt; elements in 
bold, but that doesn't mean browsers need to provide UI to toggle such 
boldness.

&gt;<i> Also notice that the user agent has a choice of how to render or use 
</I>&gt;<i> the relationships defined by &lt;link&gt;. That means that even if a UA 
</I>&gt;<i> supports HTML 4.01 completely, you have no way of knowing how or if 
</I>&gt;<i> this information will be displayed.
</I>
That's right. Until all noticable UAs render (or can be tricked into 
rendering) &lt;link&gt; reliably, authors have to (a) serve non-&lt;link&gt; 
navigation to everyone, or (b) UA-sniff and serve non-&lt;link&gt; navigation 
to UAs that can't be relied on. But that situation seems to apply to 
most, if not all, of the stuff listed in the Web Apps 1.0 requirements.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    Whereas you'd have them forced to have two navigation bars, one in 
</I>&gt;<i> the web page, and one as part of the browser that doesn't even work 
</I>&gt;<i> because the web page doesn't have any relevant &lt;link&gt; elements.
</I>
No, it would not be &quot;part of the browser&quot;; as I said, &quot;we're talking 
about parts of a Web page here&quot;. And parts of a Web page that don't 
exist usually aren't rendered.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The more feature-rich it was, the less consistent it would be, so the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less benefit there would be for authors using it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I sort of see your point, although I think you're confusing author 
</I>&gt;<i> benefits with user benefits.
</I>
True. The author benefits are indirect, in that easy-to-use sites tend 
to be more popular.

&gt;<i> Consistency is good, but it can be taken to an extreme. For instance, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link&gt; does not allow for nested menus for site navigation, nor does 
</I>&gt;<i> it allow the incorporation of a search bar. Fixed UI schemes are not 
</I>&gt;<i> always best for site navigation.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we should wait until someone actually describes a new element 
</I>&gt;<i> before we start attacking it.
</I>
Okay, so let's start. For Web Apps 1.0:

*   How can Internet Explorer be persuaded to render
     &lt;link&gt;s? (I realize that is only the first of many steps
     to implementing an MSIE shim. For example, &lt;link&gt;s with
     rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; or rel=&quot;icon&quot; need to be excluded ...)

*   How can &lt;link&gt; be extended to allow for a possible
     search form in the navigation bar? &lt;link
     rel=&quot;sitesearch&quot; href=&quot;foo.cgi&quot; method=&quot;GET&quot;
     title=&quot;Search example.com&quot;&gt;?
