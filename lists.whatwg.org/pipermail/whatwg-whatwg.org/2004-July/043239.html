    Sounds like you have the makings of a good thread on how WF2 needs 
to be corrected to degrade gracefully on XHTML Basic user agents.

    By posting messages about things like browser vendors having too 
much influence on the group on the public WHAT WG mailing list, you 
yourself are creating the basis for such perception.

    I fail to see your point from a suspicion angle. Is there a reason I 
should, for instance, suspect David Hyatt of being partial and 
anticompetitive?

    From the document above:

    &quot;Documents SHOULD clearly indicate whether they require Member-only 
confidentiality.&quot;

    Now look at this URL:

    <A HREF="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/xbl/XBL2.html">http://www.hixie.ch/specs/xbl/XBL2.html</A>

    It does NOT have a Member-only designation.

    Yes, I can simply leave your paranoid ravings unanswered in a public 
forum.
