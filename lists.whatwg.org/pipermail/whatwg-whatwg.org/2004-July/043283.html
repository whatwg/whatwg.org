That hinges on the definition of &quot;XHTML document&quot;.

XHTML defines the semantics of elements in a namespace.

With just &quot;XML&quot; and &quot;Namespaces in XML&quot;, you can then refer to this
namespace.

If you then create a document using &quot;XML&quot; and &quot;Namespaces in XML&quot; that
only contains elements from that namespace, the semantics are
well-defined, since the XHTML spec defines the semantics.

But is it an XHTML document? You didn't start from the XHTML spec to make
the document, you started from &quot;XML&quot; and &quot;Namespaces in XML&quot;, and then
just used the XHTML namespace.

The only difference between a document that complies to XHTML 1.0, and the
document you create by using XML, &quot;Namespaces in XML&quot;, and the XHTML
namespace, is the presence or absence of the DOCTYPE.


&gt;<i> The spec currently reads: &quot;Documents that use the new features described
</I>&gt;<i> in this specification using XHTML or other XML languages over HTTP must
</I>&gt;<i> be served using an XML MIME type such as application/xml or
</I>&gt;<i> application/xhtml+xml and must not be served as text/html. [RFC3023]
</I>&gt;<i> Documents served in this way may contain a DOCTYPE if desired, but this
</I>&gt;<i> is not required.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There doesn't seem to be any rationale about why this change was made,
</I>&gt;<i> and the way it's worded almost suggests to me that it might be a remnant
</I>&gt;<i> of an older paragraph.
</I>
The point is that it isn't a change. It's a fact. It described the current
reality of using namespaces in XML.

The real question is, why does XHTML1 claim otherwise?


&gt;<i> &quot;Documents served in this way&quot; doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, given
</I>&gt;<i> the preceding sentence is talking about the valid MIME types that can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to serve XHTML; if it means the documents in the previous sentence, it
</I>&gt;<i> should just be &quot;These documents&quot;, and if it means documents served as
</I>&gt;<i> text/html, it should say so (though that makes even less sense).
</I>
Fair point. &quot;These documents&quot; it is.


&gt;<i> I'm also confused about &quot;other XML languages over HTTP&quot; - this
</I>&gt;<i> specification extends HTML and XHTML, so what other (non-XHTML) XML
</I>&gt;<i> languages can this spec apply to?
</I>
Any. That's the beauty of XML namespaces. You could write an SVG document
that included some XHTML elements inside a &lt;foreignObject&gt; block, for
example.
