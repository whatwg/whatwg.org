Yes, because if input type=datetime then gets introduced differently
we have a legacy problem.

&gt;<i> &gt; Select entries arrive on the server in say 3 entries Day Month Year.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To convert this into a date to get a date object for validation it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    No, because as I stated before, you can't be sure that the server
</I>&gt;<i> will receive a value contained in the original &lt;select&gt; elements sent to
</I>&gt;<i> the client. As a matter of security, you must ALWAYS assume that the
</I>&gt;<i> values may have been intercepted and changed, or that the client
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately (or otherwise) changed the values.
</I>
How many times do I have to say THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
VALIDATION, it is completely orthogonal to the problem.  creating a
date from Month/Year/date is considerably easier than creating one
from a single string - you must see this.  And because of regional
differences in how dates are entered, it means it's not even safe to
parse a date from a string, unless you know the format entered.
&gt;<i> &gt; great give me some URI's - remember you're claiming these are common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and free, I don't believe it is remotely possible (hint the best ones
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be on Dr. John Stocktons pages)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Why? Does Google not work on your machine?
</I>
Yep, I couldn't find a single one that remotely came close, you said
you'd just found some before that were good, but chose a woeful one
simply because it was short.

&gt;<i> Besides, we can always
</I>&gt;<i> ask Dean Edwards to write as script like this while he's sleeping. 
</I>
As I say, I don't believe it can be done in under 10 lines, in fact
I'm incredibly confident of it.  Dean is a very good scripter, maybe
he'll rise to your challenge, but I'm willing to bet he won't be able
to do it.

&gt;<i>  and may not work in all implementations of
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript because you assume that setDate will increment the month if
</I>&gt;<i> given an out-of-range date value.
</I>
Which is an ECMAScript requirement, it's also been implemented
behaviour in all script agents I've ever seen, could you suggest one
where it doesn't work?

&gt;<i> &gt; And there's no way to suggest an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate control for the task, making desiging harder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm confused. Do you want MORE input types, or are you suggesting
</I>&gt;<i> another attribute (which I believe some people on this mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> would oppose).
</I>
I'm not that sure of syntax, I've described what I feel is necessary
in terms of functionality.

Jim.
