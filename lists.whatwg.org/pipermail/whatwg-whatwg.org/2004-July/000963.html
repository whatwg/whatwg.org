Actually it's not. The charter says &quot;Working group contributors will
contribute to this activity through a publicly-archived and
open-subscription mailing list. The working group members should also
respond to queries from the public on this mailing list.&quot;, it doesn't say
that if someone contacts an editor directly the editor can't also take
that feedback into account.

I would, of course, much rather people sent feedback straight to the list
where it can get peer review, but if someone feels their feedback must be
kept anonymous or confidential, I'm not going to ignore them.


&gt;&gt;<i> I've seen your comments, and for those that were rejected (not all of

</I>
Not yet; legal matters are unbelievably slow to resolve in my experience.
