<PRE>&gt;<i> Wrigley, Ave writes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * Whole-pattern matches appears to be significantly more common.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * Forms-design applications that support patterns usually make the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; pattern a whole-pattern rather than substring match.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I take the point - but I am not sure I understand why the case for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whole pattern over substring matched differs between when 
</I>&gt;<i> they appear 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a form and when they appear in a script (where substring 
</I>&gt;<i> matching 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is more common). Is this just an historical artifact, or is there a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more fundamental reason?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not totally sure of what you're saying, but I think the 
</I>&gt;<i> answer is that 
</I>&gt;<i> the two problem areas ('pattern matching in script' and 'form 
</I>&gt;<i> validation') 
</I>&gt;<i> do have different requirements. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the first case, you're matching a pattern to a string. It 
</I>&gt;<i> *might* be to 
</I>&gt;<i> validate a form control, or it might not (you might be using 
</I>&gt;<i> a regexp to 
</I>&gt;<i> remove whitespace, or something similar). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The way that regexps are designed is (to some extent) 
</I>&gt;<i> counter-intuitive - in 
</I>&gt;<i> the sense that the pattern '1234' can match a string of any 
</I>&gt;<i> length. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> this is well understood, and any semi-experienced programmer will 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically add '^' and '$' assertions into their pattern 
</I>&gt;<i> as required. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, in the 'form validation' case, you're providing a 
</I>&gt;<i> pattern that the 
</I>&gt;<i> form control must match, completely, in order to be valid. 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a much 
</I>&gt;<i> more common use case involving validation of the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> control, compared to 
</I>&gt;<i> validating that part of the control matches a given pattern 
</I>&gt;<i> (a substring 
</I>&gt;<i> match). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the historical angle, there's certainly an argument 
</I>&gt;<i> that today's 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML coders might have more familiarity with ECMAScript 
</I>&gt;<i> pattern matching 
</I>&gt;<i> than with other 'forms designer' tools. However, the two operations - 
</I>&gt;<i> 'writing validation script' and 'writing HTML' - exist (in my 
</I>&gt;<i> mind, at 
</I>&gt;<i> least) in different contexts, and so I don't think that using 
</I>&gt;<i> a different 
</I>&gt;<i> method (substring vs. whole-pattern matching) for the two is 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly 
</I>&gt;<i> confusing, especially when (with the current design) mistakes are 
</I>&gt;<i> highlighted immediately. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consistency is a good argument, but in this case, I think 
</I>&gt;<i> specialising the 
</I>&gt;<i> design to cover the problem area (and therefore introducing a lack of 
</I>&gt;<i> consistency) makes for an easier-to-use (and less prone to 
</I>&gt;<i> failure) design. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that's understandable - it's all a bit woolly, I'm afraid! 
</I>
Yes - entirely, and I think I broadly agree with you. I suppose my
discomfort is that the value of the pattern attribute is essentially
defined as &quot;a regex, but not quite ...&quot;. This is probably because I have
a strong preconception of what a regex is, and a feeling that there are
too many variants on regexes already (not to mention what is happening
with pattern matching in Perl 6)! Still, I think your use case example
probably overcomes this.

Incidentally - do you have any views on regex modifiers?
