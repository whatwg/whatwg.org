    I have no clue why you think improvements to the WF2 draft regarding 
XHTML (or subset thereof) would be off topic.

&gt;<i> Did you miss the &quot;not that I think it's relevant&quot; part, where I

</I>
    I was referring to suspicion, not the relevance of browser history. 
I had asked why we should suspect the WHAT WG members specifically of 
some of the underhanded tactics you suggest people were using nine years 
ago. That makes it relevant to what I was saying, even if you don't find 
it relevant for your purposes.

&gt;&gt;<i>   Now look at this URL:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   It does NOT have a Member-only designation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It uses the member only stylesheet, it's a member only document, if
</I>&gt;<i> that's really the defence for ignoring W3 process, it's a pretty poor

</I>
    The stylesheet is not proof that the document is Member-only. All 
that means is that someone may have used a stripped down Member-only 
document as a template for another document. Also, even if you assume 
this one stylesheet reference is proof it is Member-only content, you 
have no proof that Ian knew it was Member-only, as you'd have to be 
looking carefully at the source to determine this.
