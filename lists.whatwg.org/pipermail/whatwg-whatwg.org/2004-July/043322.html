&gt;<i> And with the keyboard, given a sufficiently well-designed datepicker

</I>
I don't think a date picker is particularly useable for picking
birthdate (it's such a common sequence of characters just typing it
into a single box is fastest)  but I agree defaulting to today
wouldn't be a problem.

&gt;<i> Then the datepicker could default to whichever of min or max is closest
</I>&gt;<i> to the current date/time. (This would be the most appropriate default,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, for airline booking forms.)
</I>
I'm not sure I completely agree with this, many airline booking forms
choose today+7 as a default, not today+1 and the return leg today+1 is
not really a logical default either.  Also we have the problem that
for me the windows date picker is pretty useless at picking a specific
date.    For example hundreds of millions of transactions have
succesfully gone through HP openskies CGI scripts, which uses a simple
double select drop down (and optional javascript approach if you need
the datetime).   This is a known UI and very successful, how does a
datetime control really improve the user experience in this case?

&gt;<i> Password fields are another. How do you distinguish missing a password
</I>&gt;<i> field from intentionally leaving it blank? You can't.
</I>
These (text/password) are different, since they can have validation
rules which require non-empty empty input, you can't do that with
checkbox/radio.

&gt;<i> Checkboxes are another. How do you distinguish missing the checkbox
</I>&gt;<i> from intentionally leaving it unchecked? In HTML at least, you can't.
</I>
In IE's implementation you can, and I think this is a great feature
and should be considered.

&gt;<i> SELECT menus -- as explicitly stated in the WF2 spec -- are another.
</I>&gt;<i> How do you distinguish missing the menu from intentionally choosing the
</I>&gt;<i> first option? You can't.
</I>
but the server can identify that &quot;please select...&quot; in the first entry
didn't happen.

Jim.
