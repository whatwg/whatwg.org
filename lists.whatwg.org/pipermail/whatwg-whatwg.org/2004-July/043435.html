Yes, that's what I meant by &quot;a two-dimensional menu for day&quot;.

So if, for example, your OS was set to DD/MM/YYYY date format, a 
datepicker might appear like this:

                      [11/07/2004]H

This is what a datepicker looks like in all toolkits I know of. (&quot;H&quot; 
represents a pair of increment+decrement buttons.)

By default, the &quot;11&quot; would be selected. So to change the value to July 
24th, for example, you would type &quot;24&quot;, replacing the 11.

To enter a completely different date, you could type it, e.g. 
&quot;13/6/1989&quot;. Typing each &quot;/&quot; would navigate to (and select) the next 
segment of the field, just like pressing the right arrow key would. So 
even for days, months, and years that were *all* far away from those in 
the current date (so it was not worth using the up and down keys to 
increment/decrement the default value), typing the new date would be 
exactly the same, and exactly as efficient, as if you'd typed it in an 
empty text field.

Single-clicking on a segment of the field would select that segment. 
Double-clicking on it, or clicking-and-holding on it, could open a 
menu:
                              ____
                             | ^  |
                             |1999|
                             |2000|
                             |2001|
                             |2002|
                             |2003|
                       [11/07*2004*H
                             |2005|
                             |2006|
                             |2007|
                             |2008|
                             |2009|
                             | v  |
                              &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

As I said, for year and month this menu would be one-
-dimensional, but for day it would be two-dimensional.

     | 5  6  7  8  9 10*11*07/2004]H
     |12 13 14 15 16 17 18|
     |19 20 21 22 23 24 25|
     |26 27 28 29 30 31   |
      &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

Now here's the part that would be more efficient than a full-blown 
calendar. If you wanted to, for example, find &quot;the Tuesday just over 
eight weeks from today&quot;, you could just drag the menu rightward to 
Tuesday and downward eight rows, and the menu would contract and expand 
to follow you. (This is similar to the &quot;Insert Table&quot; toolbar 
menubutton in Microsoft Word, which you can drag to specify the number 
of rows * columns in the table.)

            &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
That would be much quicker than flipping back and forth through months 
in a fixed calendar control.

&gt;<i> ...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         invalid accept attribute, the value is assumed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         be &quot;*/*&quot;. Such an attribute for a file upload
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         control still overrides any accept attribute for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the relevant form element.'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (Why? Because the faulty value is much more likely to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be the author's attempt at a non-specialization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     exception to the form's rule, than an attempt at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     specialization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd rather see the thing ignored, which is the usual way of handling 
</I>&gt;<i> errors like this.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Yes, it would be nice if that was a reasonable thing to do. But if the 
FORM element has a valid accept attribute, it's unlikely to be a 
superset of the intended type for the individual control; so it's 
highly likely to result in a form unusable for its intended purpose.
