Not really, since the spec proposes nothing about XHTML Basic, so
anything I'd say would be off-topic.

&gt;<i> &gt; Not that I actually think it's relevant, but many of the individuals

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of course, getting their expertise involved)

Did you miss the &quot;not that I think it's relevant&quot; part, where I
thought I made it pretty clear that I didn't think it was relevant.  I
was simply rebutting your suggestion that because Safari/Mozilla
didn't exist the history of browser development wasn't relevant.

&gt;<i>    Now look at this URL:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/xbl/XBL2.html">http://www.hixie.ch/specs/xbl/XBL2.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    It does NOT have a Member-only designation.
</I>
It uses the member only stylesheet, it's a member only document, if
that's really the defence for ignoring W3 process, it's a pretty poor
one.

&gt;<i>    Yes, I can simply leave your paranoid ravings unanswered in a public
</I>&gt;<i> forum.
</I>
Sure, there's nothing wrong with doing so, Others are free to judge
from what's written.

Jim.
