I have no clue what you are trying to say here.


&gt;<i> &gt; But if an HTML-based WF2 document is sent as something other than

</I>
If these two questions are related, I've missed the link, sorry.


&gt;<i> Meaning what?
</I>
It means that the document is non-conformant. That the author has written
markup that is incorrect. I would have thought you were familiar with the
term &quot;non-conformant&quot;.


&gt;<i> What are the conformance requirements on a WF2 viewer?
</I>
These are spelled out in detail in the WF2 spec, I don't think I can
easily summarise them here.


&gt;&gt;<i> For people who want to use XHTML, as I do on, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really see the use case in WF2 terms.
</I>
If you don't care about IE, and like the strictness of well-formedness
checking, then using XML is the way to go. If you are using XML, then WF2
and WA1 would be quite useful, in conjunction with XHTML, for writing Web
pages. What else would you use?

I have passed your comment on to the site administrators.
