<PRE>There are security concerns with allowing customization of the file 
upload control.  You don't want file upload controls to be able to 
masquerade as other content.

</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226;	Make the file upload control fully customizable by CSS as the

</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226;	Possibly allow the textbox and Browse button to be treated

</I>&gt;<i> regular HTML type properties and CSS properties.
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226;	Allow upload of more than one file per upload control, but do not 
</I>&gt;<i> force the number of files specified to be required and instead offer a 
</I>&gt;<i> validation option that would either force this or allow it to be any 
</I>&gt;<i> number of files within the specified range (i.e.: 4 is specified; 
</I>&gt;<i> allow 1 to 4 files; not requiring a minimum of 4)
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226;
