</I>
Hmm, yes. I was wondering about this as well. As far as I know, all 
post-HTML2 HTML documents and all XHTML documents require a DOCTYPE. 

The spec currently reads: &quot;Documents that use the new features described in 
this specification using XHTML or other XML languages over HTTP must be 
served using an XML MIME type such as application/xml or 
application/xhtml+xml and must not be served as text/html. [RFC3023] 
Documents served in this way may contain a DOCTYPE if desired, but this is 
not required.&quot; 

There doesn't seem to be any rationale about why this change was made, and 
the way it's worded almost suggests to me that it might be a remnant of an 
older paragraph. 

&quot;Documents served in this way&quot; doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, given 
the preceding sentence is talking about the valid MIME types that can be 
used to serve XHTML; if it means the documents in the previous sentence, it 
should just be &quot;These documents&quot;, and if it means documents served as 
text/html, it should say so (though that makes even less sense). 

I'm also confused about &quot;other XML languages over HTTP&quot; - this specification 
extends HTML and XHTML, so what other (non-XHTML) XML languages can this 
spec apply to? 

[I was also going to ask &quot;and what's the relevance of HTTP?&quot;, but I've just 
realised that it's '(XHTML or XML) over HTTP', not 'XHTML or (XML over 
HTTP)'.] 

Regards,
Malcolm
