</I>&gt;<i>    There were two reasons for not using this. First, you'd have to have

</I>
That's a reason?  I'm sorry, that's exactly equivalent to &quot;you'd have
to have a different string in each type&quot;    It's not a reason to
reject.

&gt;<i> Next, you'd either have to add new attributes to handle stuff
</I>&gt;<i> like |value| and |name|
</I>
nope, OBJECT is already a form element, and has a name.  You would
need to use a PARAM or a new value attribute for a defaultValue,  I
don't see how that invalidates the suggestion.

&gt;<i> It's also my understanding that there were certain
</I>&gt;<i> complications involved with the |classid| value, but I forget what those
</I>&gt;<i> were.
</I>
Only that my example using URN was poorly chosen in that it's not
usable, picking a different URI is no problem.

None of these reasons are particular onerous, I hope there are other
ones being used to reject this.

Jim.
