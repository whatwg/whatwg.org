Why is it a problem that a number no user would ever type in as a 
date could be parsed as one by a javascript function?

</I>
The VBScript solution posted could be used to parse an ambiguous date 

1) with an eye on the user's locale, which might help deciding how to 
parse an ambiguous date
2) in order to format and display the date in a non-ambiguous way to 
the user so that the user can spot errors and correct a date that has 
been misunderstood.

If you are in the wrong country you may first have to work out how to 
turn the IME off :-)

HRMS (currently living in France with a laptop bought in the UK and 
four keyboard setups in Windows: en-gb, Norwegian, MS Japanese IME, 
and Icelandic. Keyboard layout localization can REALLY get your head 
spinning. Not to mention back at Oslo university when I wanted to try 
the Dvorak keyboard and happily accepted that the machine had to 
reboot to change keyboard, forgetting for a moment that I had to LOG 
IN again.)
