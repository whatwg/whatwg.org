<PRE>&gt;<i> [ was this meant for the list? ]
</I>
Yes, it was - apologies, I have just posted it.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do you really want to put vendors into the position of 
</I>&gt;<i> deciding just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what to call the Malvinas Islands?  Or exactly the status of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; palestine or the Gaza Strip.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No ... that is why it is specified as an ISO 3166. It should be a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirement for browsers to be compliant to this standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think this standard is all that common, in the UK 
</I>&gt;<i> for example, you nearly always get GB split up.
</I>
I'm surpirsed that you say it isn't all that commmon. It is, after all
(and with one notable exception), the standard on which two letter
domain names are based. I expect you will find (although I say this with
no real justification apart from my prejudice ;-) that most country
selection menus on web forms are based on ISO 3166, and are broadly
similar to the example.
 
&gt;<i> My argument is that the vast majority case will be people 
</I>&gt;<i> writing their own, therefore we shouldn't special case the 
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-3166 case, placing implementation and maintenance burdens 
</I>&gt;<i> on vendors (what happens when Opera goes bankrupt?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [the detailed proposals don't degrade, so need to be voided 
</I>&gt;<i> straight off, unfortunately]
</I>
Sorry about that - I wasn't suggesting this as a formal declaration,
just an example of how it might work. I am happy to defer to people who
know more about HTML than me on the details. What do you mean by
&quot;degrade&quot;? Do you mean that the example wouldn't work on some browsers?
What aspect? Is it the &lt;select /&gt; type unary tag?
