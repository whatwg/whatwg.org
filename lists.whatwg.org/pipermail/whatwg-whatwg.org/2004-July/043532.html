    Actually, I think the confusion comes from the difference between 
semantic mutual exclusion and presentational mutual exclusion. For 
presentation, tabs are mutually exclusive, as they allow only one 
section to be viewable at one time. Assuming elements for use in making 
tabs and wizards are named semantically, the term &quot;exclusive&quot; should 
probably not be part of the names.

    I wonder if it might not be possible to come up with a system for 
tracking suggestions for WHAT WG specs that are made by the public. 
Perhaps something similar to Bugzilla, or some kind of wiki system. That 
way, we wouldn't have to go fishing in the mailing list archives for 
other people's ideas on features for WHAT WG specifications. It would 
also help people understand why something was rejected.

    For instance, people could go to a web page that has a list of 
topics like &quot;hiding legacy code&quot;, then click on the &quot;&lt;ignore&gt;&quot; 
suggestion and see not only my idea for the &lt;ignore&gt; element, but Ian's 
reasoning for why it should not be included. People could then add their 
own thoughts on the matter.
