    Very well. &lt;datalist&gt;. &lt;choicelist&gt; is a bit too long.

[Snipped part regarding evil UAs not reporting what features they 
support correctly.]

    Okay, but that leaves us back at square one with regards to:

    a) Hiding legacy content from WF2 UAs.
    b) Hiding WF2 content from legacy UAs.

    For (a), all we have the the repetition template, with will probably 
lead to wide-spread abuse. For (b), the only solution I can come up with 
(especially in light of the fact that XHTML can ignore comments) is some 
form of client-side include that pulls in content from a file. Beyond 
that, you're looking at ECMAScript or CSS in both situations.

&gt;&gt;<i>Your model supports calling the list from a &lt;select&gt; within a template?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, why not? It just does a getElementById() on the value of the &quot;list&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, then does a getElementsByTagName() to get all the &lt;option&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> children of that element. It doesn't matter where the element is.
</I>
    Hmm. So, really, if we cold come up with a solution for (a) above 
that wouldn't involve inappropriate use of the repetition model, then 
what I had would be fine:

    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;combo1&quot; list=&quot;list1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;norender&gt;
      &lt;label&gt; or select from the list:
        &lt;select id=&quot;list1&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Stuff. --&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
      &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/norender&gt;

    Actually, in this case, we don't even need &lt;datalist&gt;, and the 
WF2-only code would look like this:

    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;combo1&quot; list=&quot;list1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;norender&gt;
      &lt;select id=&quot;list1&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Stuff. --&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/norender&gt;

    Then again, with an element like &lt;norender&gt;, you could even do this:

    &lt;norender&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;combo1&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;label for=&quot;list1&quot;&gt; or select from the list:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/norender&gt;
    &lt;select editable id=&quot;list1&quot; name=&quot;combo1&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Stuff. --&gt;&lt;/select&gt;

    So, in a WF2-compliant UA, you just use &lt;select editable&gt;. We keep 
trying to kill it, but it just won't die!!! ;)

&gt;&gt;<i>Okay, you just described the menu features in XUL
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, I described the menu features of any modern GUI platform. Mac OS X,
</I>&gt;<i> Longhorn, GTK2, Windows XP, etc, they all have these features.
</I>
    See! It's THAT good! ;)

&gt;&gt;<i>and yet you have repeatedly stated that you don't know if the XUL markup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is the best way to represent this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By which I mean exactly that -- I don't know. I haven't yet looked at the
</I>&gt;<i> context menu requirements with an eye to write up the spec. I have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> if the XUL markup is appropriate or not. Maybe it is perfect. Maybe it is
</I>&gt;<i> almost perfect but needs a few tweaks. Maybe it uses terrible attribute
</I>&gt;<i> names and terrible content models and the whole thing should be scrapped
</I>&gt;<i> and a new model written instead.
</I>
    Perhaps I should start a thread on what parts of the XUL menu model 
would be appropriate for inclusion in Web Apps 1.0...Get the ball 
rolling while you finish up WF2.

&gt;&gt;<i>I was generally hoping we could get a model for prepopulating a number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of different structures. This might be useful when used in conjunction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>with the repetition model...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you explain how? I'm not sure I understand the use case here.
</I>
    Good point. It's a powerful feature in search of a reason to use it.
