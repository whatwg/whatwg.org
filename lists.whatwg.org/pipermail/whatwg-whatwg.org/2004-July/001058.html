I don't see why you're calling these sections &quot;mutually exclusive&quot;.
The /presentation/ of each section excludes the presentation of other
sections, but I've yet to see an example of how the sections are
themselves mutually exclusive. As has been described before, degrading
a set of preference panels into a long page of fieldsets makes just
as much logical sense as the tabs, it's just less pleasant to look at.
The one difference I see is that the tabs are &quot;unordered&quot; (i.e. they
can degrade to a set of fieldsets arranged in any order without changing
the meaning, like the items in an unordered list) whilst an actual page
of fieldsets implies ordering (ordered list).
