</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;label&gt;Enter date of visit as YYYY-MM-DD:

They could, and I probably should have mentioned that. They would still need 
to change the server-side processing to parse a date in that format, 
however, and (possibly more significantly) they would then be requiring 
users to enter dates in a 'foreign' format. For a site with a sufficiently 
savvy or international audience, that's unlikely to be a problem (for 
example, both Bugzilla and Bonsai request dates in ISO format), but for a 
small site designed to serve 'local' customers only, requiring an ISO format 
is likely to be perceived as particularly unfriendly. 

My key point is this, I suppose: All of the other (commonly-used) input 
types are directly backward-compatible with existing practice, which allows 
a seamless upgrade to WF2 controls. All, that is, except for 'date'. Can we 
improve 'date' so that existing sites can upgrade with minimal effort? 

&gt;&gt;<i> Critically, I am not proposing a general-purpose format specifier; the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowed values for this attribute would be drawn from a short list of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'common' date formats. The ones I had in mind were &quot;iso&quot; (for ISO8601, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the default, yyyy-mm-dd), &quot;d/m/y&quot; (UK format, dd/mm/yyyy), &quot;m/d/y&quot; (US 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format, mm/dd/yyyy), and probably a 'European' format &quot;d.m.y&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (dd.mm.yyyy).
</I>&gt;<i>   If there was going to be a date format attribute, then I would insist 
</I>&gt;<i> that it accepts strings using the same letter convention as in the
</I>&gt;<i> ISO8601 spec.
</I>
I think that's a very bad idea, for the reasons I mentioned in my original 
email. However ... 

&gt;<i> [..] I think attempting to restrict it to a list 
</I>&gt;<i> of predefined formats wouldn't work anyway, because authors don't always 
</I>&gt;<i> read the specs, so many would just guess and think they could enter it 
</I>&gt;<i> however they like.
</I>
... I think that's a very persuasive argument. My alternative was to used 
named formats ('ISO', 'US', 'UK', 'Europe', though I wasn't particularly 
happy with the choice of names). Is that better?

Malcolm
