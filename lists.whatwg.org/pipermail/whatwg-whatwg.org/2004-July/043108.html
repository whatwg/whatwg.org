I intend to say that the content model of the &lt;datalist&gt; element is the
same as the content model of its parent with the addition that &lt;option&gt;
elements may be allowed as direct children, and that the &lt;datalist&gt;
element is allowed anywhere that the &lt;select&gt; element is.

No, of course they will do that. Just like they do:

   &lt;h6&gt;(c) copyright 1999 by I Don't Understand HTML&lt;/h6&gt;

   &lt;blockquote&gt; Look at me, I'm indented. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

   &lt;p&gt; I want some &lt;cite&gt;italic text&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;div&gt;this is paragraph 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is paragraph 2&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;body&gt;&lt;font size=7&gt;header&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=3&gt;body text

The point is not that people won't abuse the markup, the point is that the
spec shouldn't _require_ that you abuse the markup in order to do the
right thing. This repetition templates have nothing to do with combo
boxes, they shouldn't be used to do them.


&gt;<i> Well, it's not exactly what they'd put in it, but the point is that
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;datalist&gt; could be abused in a similar way to repetition blocks.
</I>
The difference being that it seemed you _wanted_ them to abuse repetition
blocks. :-)


&gt;<i> Furthermore, what happens if the &lt;select&gt; element doesn't have the
</I>&gt;<i> same |name| as the &lt;input&gt;?
</I>
&lt;datalist&gt; is ignored by legacy UAs. So what happens is the same as if you
gave the markup to the UA without the &lt;datalist&gt; tags.


&gt;<i> Would it be valid in WF2 to include more than one &lt;select&gt; element in
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;datalist&gt;?
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> What happens if multiple &lt;selects&gt; have the same |name|.
</I>
Same as now.


&gt;<i> Not that this approach couldn't work if it had specific limitations and
</I>&gt;<i> rules. It's just that it seems to confusing for the web developers to be
</I>&gt;<i> workable. On the other hand, using a repetition template is powerful but
</I>&gt;<i> easy to understand. My example may have used it for an unintended
</I>&gt;<i> purpose, but there is no confusion about what works in a repetition
</I>&gt;<i> block and what doesn't.
</I>
I don't see why. There's very little practical difference between &lt;div
repeat=&quot;template&quot; repeat-start=&quot;0&quot;&gt; and &lt;datalist&gt;.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, I don't think I liked having my |list| property
</I>&gt;<i> reference a &lt;select&gt; in a repetition template. I was exploring all the
</I>&gt;<i> options, but that option raises too many question and just doesn't feel
</I>&gt;<i> right to me. Better to duplicate the list contents.
</I>
Why? Duplication seems error prone at best.


&gt;<i> This sounds like we're making up complex markup rules for the webmasters
</I>&gt;<i> to memorize. The &lt;option&gt; elements are supposed to be inside a &lt;select&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> element, but only when dealing with legacy-UAs.
</I>
More to the point, &lt;option&gt; is allowed inside &lt;select&gt; if you want the
list to be available to legacy UAs, and &lt;option&gt; is also allowed inside
&lt;datalist&gt; if you don't mind the list not being visible to legacy UAs.


&gt;<i> You can use some elements inside &lt;datalist&gt;, like &lt;label&gt; and &lt;select&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> but not others.
</I>
You can use whatever elements you could use in its parent.


&gt;<i> You can use |data| to load options into a |select|, but not when
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;select&gt; is inside a &lt;datalist&gt;.
</I>
You can use |data| to prefill a &lt;select&gt; wherever it is.


&gt;<i> While my &lt;cl&gt; + repetition template solution was a bit longer and
</I>&gt;<i> repeated the option list, it never introduced this many rules to keep
</I>&gt;<i> track of.
</I>
I think it introduces the same number of rules, as far as I can tell.
