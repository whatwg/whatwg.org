That a datetime control degrades into something usable, I've explained
it lots of time in this thread.

Massaging all of those (well perhaps not the last) into the date
intended by the user, is not simple, it's a lot more complicated than,
just taking the date/month/year from the 3 input controls on most
international forms today.

&gt;<i> &gt; Could you show me an example WF2 page using datetime that degrades to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that please?  Since the example format solution makes no sense if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; datetime element is rendered by a WF-2 user agent.

</I>
No, it's not - that may be the common case for when you first enter a
form, but even those forms upon an invalid response in it will
repopulate the form with the invalid data.  This makes the approach
unworkable for me, as after a validation failure I cannot leave the
user value in there.  Quite apart from it failing in all the other
cases where authors wish to set up a value.

&gt;<i> In non-JS cases with default values, the value is likely to give
</I>&gt;<i> enough of a hint to the user anyway.
</I>
You've still not explained how javascript can identify a datetime
supporting UA, and until you do this, you cannot advocate a javascript
solution!

&gt;<i> If those aren't enough, we could look into a new element that hides
</I>&gt;<i> content on legacy UAs but not WF2 UAs, 
</I>
Why bother, when we already have an HTML 4 compatible way of achieving
this (OBJECT) which is only being rejected not because it doesn't
degrade on IE, but because it does!  That really seems a ridiculous
reason to me.

&gt;<i> but (for reasons I've explained
</I>&gt;<i> many times) I really don't think that's a good idea.
</I>
No, it's a poor one, but there are more options to solving the
problem, which don't seem to be been given sensible consideration.

Jim.
