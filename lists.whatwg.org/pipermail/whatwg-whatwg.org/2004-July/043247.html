They are developed in public. Here is the absolute latest copy of the
development:

   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/</A>


&gt;<i> Not they'll be developed in public, except for comments that are

</I>&gt;<i> document itself that is public)

If a painter stands in the street and paints, he is painting in public,
yes? If someone shouts a suggestion to him and he takes it into account,
he is still painting in public, no? If someone walks up to him and
whispers something that only the painter can hear, and he then takes it
into account, that is still painting in public, no?

If I make a change to the spec mentioned above, that is in public, right?
If I make a change to the spec in response to the comments here, that's
still in public, right? So why do you think that making a change in
response to a comment you didn't hear is no longer in public?

In particular, why is a change that I come up with considered &quot;public&quot; but
a change that someone suggests over lunch no longer public?


WHATWG specs are developed in public. Feedback is accepted in public.
That public feedback is responded to in public. That private feedback is
also accepted doesn't change any of this.
