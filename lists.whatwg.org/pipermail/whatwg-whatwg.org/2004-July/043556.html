</I>
So you wish to specifically exclude the plug-in approach, why do you
wish to do this?

In any case, whether plug-ins are relevant or not to the approach, it
doesn't invalidate the point I was making.  The argument against
OBJECT so far relies on a particular DOM issue in a particular
environment against an assumption of a particular style of script
support, that should not be sufficient reason to reject it.

&gt;<i> By
</I>&gt;<i> contrast, most of those browser have Javascript on and support HTC.
</I>
Er, no, only a couple of versions of 1 browser family support HTC's
(and even then they can be disabled seperately from the rest of
javascript.  javascript alone has hugely better support than HTC's

&gt;<i> Therefore, we should not use markup that we can't make work using
</I>&gt;<i> non-binary methods.
</I>
Quite right too, completely irrelevant to the point I was making, but
thanks for echoing it.

Jim.
