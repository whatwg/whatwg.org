</I>
    Who's to say it wasn't a consensus between the WHAT WG members? Ian 
already stated that WHAT WG materials don't have to be the result of a 
consensus between contributers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I read that as saying that no XML profile is appropriate for WF2 -
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>since XML by definition requires that non-WF documents are a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>catastophic fail.  So the WF2 work doesn't follow that principle of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>the paper.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Indeed. Terrible, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure that's really an appropriate answer, could you actually
</I>&gt;<i> answer the point - Why if the whole basis of the work is from that
</I>&gt;<i> paper are we not following the principles laid out in it?
</I>
    Ian has already stated that he doesn't believe in those profiles. He 
feels that if a specification needs additional profiles to make it work 
properly in certain situations, it is likely because of a problem with 
the original specification.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>So I look forward to the removal of the XHTML mess (something that a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>number of people on the list have already agreed with)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What XHTML mess?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Er, rather forgetful this morning aren't we:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;url: <A HREF="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml">http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml</A> &gt;
</I>
    I fail to see where you're going with that, especially since:

A) The Web Forms 2.0 specification is consistent with the content of the 
URL listed above.

B) Dean Edwards has an XML styling method that allows XHTML documents to 
display on IE using the correct MIME type.
