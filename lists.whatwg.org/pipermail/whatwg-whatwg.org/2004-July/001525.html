Indeed, but that's a completely different threat scenario to access
non javascript files across domains.   I think you're being very
misleadin about why cross domain access to URLS are blocked.

&gt;<i> This doesn't make web services less secure - most programing toolkits

</I>
Most programming toolkits aren't run in a browser!  This _DOES_ make
Mozilla SOAP in secure, I have SOAP services running on this intranet
which are protected purely by the fact they're behind the firewall,
any machine here can access them, those outside cannot - However,
www.anydomain.org can use them easily, if someone happens to drop an
XML file in the root.

&gt;<i> If they want to restrict, they can use username/passwords to do that,
</I>&gt;<i> as does Google.
</I>
This is orthogonal to the ability of a webbrowser to make the request.

&gt;<i> The only reason we didn't allow cross domain web services access are
</I>&gt;<i> intranets - since mozilla does the actually SOAP connection, user A in
</I>&gt;<i> a workplace with internet and intranet access could get to evil.com,
</I>&gt;<i> which talks to an intranet web service.
</I>
Ah, so you do understand the problem, unfortunately though, you don't
actually realise that not all &quot;intranets&quot; are quite so simple as you
describe for Mozilla to know.

This is not secure, and I ask you again, How do I disable this ability
in Mozilla, it is laxxer security, please do not pretend otherwise
with your &quot;cross frame scripting is always possible&quot; and can you
please tell me how to disable this 'feature' in Mozilla.

For the other browser vendors in WHATWG - Do not implement this.

Jim.
