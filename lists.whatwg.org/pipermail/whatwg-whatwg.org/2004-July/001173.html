    So anyone can join W3C...if they happen to have money or popularity. 
That pretty much rules me out. ;)

    As for WHAT WG membership, they'd probably let you in if someone 
invited you. One would hope they won't let you in just because you gave 
them money. That sound corrupt to me.

    Of course! Would you rather have a situation where any idiot could 
come in as a WHAT WG member and demand that the Interactive Fiction 
Markup Language be incorporated into the next version of HTML?

    &quot;It is pitch black! Your CSS might get eaten by a grue!&quot;

    We're racing against the clock. Only by narrowing the scope of this 
group can we hope to get anything accomplished in a reasonable timeframe.
