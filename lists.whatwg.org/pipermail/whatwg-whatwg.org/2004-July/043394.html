    And then the implementation can be held hostage by the standards 
bodies for as long as they want. No thanks.

    Now you're just being silly. For instance, is &quot;10/7/04&quot; the same as 
&quot;October 7th, 2004&quot;, &quot;July 10th, 2004&quot; or &quot;April 7th, 2010&quot;? A format 
has to be chosen. It's not optional. WF2 solves this problem by using an 
ISO standard. In legacy clients, we don't have a fixed format for 
submission, so we have to ensure the submitted date has a SPECIFIC one.

</I>
    Which, as you admit, is an arbitrary number you picked, and you've 
already stated that you need a non-JS solution, so why are we going on 
about this?

&gt;&gt;<i>   Please make a list of the specific cases you want Web Forms 2.0 to

</I>&gt;<i> They're made on the list, Ian will pick them up I'm sure.  That's what

</I>
    Fine, then take your chances with Ian. I have better things to do 
than to search over 1,100 messages for your sake.
