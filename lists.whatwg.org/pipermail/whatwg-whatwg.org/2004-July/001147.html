</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The process doesn't involve getting consensus from the mailing list.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes but then previously in this thread you refused to discuss something
</I>&gt;<i> (well you said it's &quot;not up for discussion&quot; ) so no, everything is not
</I>&gt;<i> consensus if there are areas which are not up for consensus - Because of

Oh, right. The basis of the WHATWG work -- the charter and the position
paper, together forming the principles under which the WHATWG operates --
are what the members agree is the most important. Within the framework of
the charter and the position paper, discussion guides the design work.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I read that as saying that no XML profile is appropriate for WF2 -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; since XML by definition requires that non-WF documents are a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; catastophic fail.  So the WF2 work doesn't follow that principle of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed. Terrible, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure that's really an appropriate answer, could you actually
</I>&gt;<i> answer the point - Why if the whole basis of the work is from that
</I>&gt;<i> paper are we not following the principles laid out in it?
</I>
Because changing fundamental conformance criteria of XML is not within the
scope of the WHATWG.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So I look forward to the removal of the XHTML mess (something that a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; number of people on the list have already agreed with)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What XHTML mess?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Er, rather forgetful this morning aren't we:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;url: <A HREF="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml">http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml</A> &gt;
</I>
Oh, the sending XML as text/html mess? You'll be pleased to see that this
has indeed been removed from WF2:
