I don't.

First of all, the solution needs to apply to XHTML as well as HTML. If 
we still assume XML is to be taken seriously (and not as tag soup), 
doctype sniffing on the XML side is totally, utterly bogus. The reason 
why it is bogus is that including a DTD by reference and pasting it 
inline are supposed to be equivalent for validating XML processor and 
in the latter case you don't see a public identifier for the DTD. 
Hence, using the public identifier for any purpose other than locating 
the DTD is just plain wrong. Of course, sane real-world XHTML user 
agents use non-validating XML processors which makes the inclusion of 
the doctype declaration rather pointless. I think the current WF2 
stance of encouraging doctypelessness on the XML side is the right way 
to go.

Now, similar argumentation does not work on the HTML side if we agree 
not to pretend that real SGML is being processed. Doctype sniffing is a 
tag soup solution to a tag soup problem. Still, doctype sniffing is 
already confusing and convoluted enough for casual authors. (See 
<A HREF="http://iki.fi/hsivonen/doctype.html">http://iki.fi/hsivonen/doctype.html</A> for subtle differences between user 
agents.)  I think perturbing it further is a bad idea. Besides, you 
can't force the existing installed base of browsers to do new tricks 
with doctypes which would mean different defaulting.
