   LOL! Treating my messages like trash... oh well, no big deal.

</I>
   I was thinking that there are different cases where mutually 
exclusive sections are used.  For example:
1. In wizard interfaces where the user must sequentially step through
    each, usually with Next and Back buttons.
    This could use something like &lt;sequential&gt; for the container.

eg.
&lt;sequential&gt;
	&lt;exclusive&gt;...&lt;/exclusive&gt;
	&lt;exclusive&gt;...&lt;/exclusive&gt;
&lt;/sequential&gt;

   (my preference is for &lt;exclusive&gt;, rather than &lt;mxsection&gt;, simply 
becuase I like actual words, rather than abbreviations where possible, 
and when there's no benefit of either being shorter to type)

2. In options/properties dialogs, or other tabbed interfaces where the
    user can view them in any order, usually with tabs or buttons.
    This could use something like &lt;concurrent&gt; for the container.
eg.
&lt;concurrent&gt;
	&lt;exclusive&gt;...&lt;/exclusive&gt;
	&lt;exclusive&gt;...&lt;/exclusive&gt;
&lt;/concurrent&gt;

   The element names could probably be better, expesially &lt;concurrent&gt;. 
  I wanted an antonym for sequential, and that was the most appropriate 
I could find with my limited research.

&gt;<i>    The problem here that you're ignoring is that in the most common web 
</I>&gt;<i> browser in the world doesn't even allow styling for these new elements, 
</I>&gt;<i> which means they degrade into nothing but their child contents. In fact, 
</I>&gt;<i> the opening and closing tags will be treated as separate, stand-alone 
</I>&gt;<i> elements, so the DOM will have all their contents as siblings rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than children.
</I>
   So, effectivly they degrade to unstyled &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; elements 
(depending on whether it defaults to block or inline styling &#8212; I'd 
assume inline, which is effectivly no style at all, but I could be 
wrong)  Either way, I don't see that as a real problem.  User agnets 
with styles disabled or unsupporeted handle &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; just fine, 
and the content is completey useable (for accessible documents, where 
semantic markup has been used properly).
