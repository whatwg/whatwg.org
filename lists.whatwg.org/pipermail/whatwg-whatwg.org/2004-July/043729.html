<PRE>Hi Ian,

Two questions occurred to me while I was looking at the spec recently:

Firstly, if I want to allow a user to upload more than one file through 
file upload control, but I don't care how many (for example: as 
attachments to an email, which don't have any particular limit), how do 
I express this? Can I use 'max' to mean 'more than one, but not 
limited'? Do I need to pick a large arbitrary number - 'max=&quot;9999&quot;'?

[incidentally, 'min' and 'max' are specified as &quot;positive integers&quot; for 
file upload controls. Is zero positive?]

Secondly, what is the interaction between 'min', 'max', and 'required' 
for file upload controls? Specifically, what does 'required' mean for a 
file upload control? Is it equivalent to 'min=1' or 'min=max', or 
something else? What happens if all three are specified?

At the moment, it's described in terms of the control 'having a value', 
but there's no definition as to what that means for a file upload 
control, and other text, for example &quot;Any non-empty value satisfies the 
required condition, including a simple whitespace character.&quot;, clearly 
doesn't make sense for this control (since it cannot submit unless the 
file exists).

Regards,
Malcolm
