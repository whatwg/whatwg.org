<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes - but it puts the requiremment to keep the data up to date in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hands of the browser, rather than the application developer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if I don't upgrade my user agent to the latest from the
</I>&gt;<i> vendor, I can't enter my country into your form?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you really want to put vendors into the position of
</I>&gt;<i> deciding just what to call the Malvinas Islands?  Or exactly 
</I>&gt;<i> the status of palestine or the Gaza Strip.
</I>
No ... that is why it is specified as an ISO 3166. It should be a
requirement for browsers to be compliant to this standard. It shouldn't
be too difficult for browsers to centralize maintenance of this
compliance - easier probably than for every web from maintainer to do
independently. Possibly, it could be tied in to an ISO URL (like
<A HREF="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists">http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists</A>
/iso_3166-1_xml_en.zip - especially if there were an uncomressed
version!).
 
&gt;<i> Then you get problems with do you want England and Wales or UK ?
</I>
Well, I guess we would have to leave that up to ISO (although if that
were the case we should have .gb rather than .uk domain - but that's
another story ;-).

&gt;<i> I don't really think this could be specified to be truly useful, and 
</I>&gt;<i> most people will end up writing their own list anyway.
</I>
If people are not happy with ISO 3166, then they can write their own
list (as they do now!).

&gt;<i> I could be wrong, why not produce a more detailed proposal?
</I>
OK - this isn't exactly detailed, but hopefully it gives the idea! What
I had in mind was something along the lines of:

&lt;select name=&quot;country_code&quot; type=&quot;iso3166&quot; /&gt;

Which would expand to:

&lt;select name=&quot;country_code&quot; &gt;
&lt;option value=&quot;AFG&quot;&gt;AFGHANISTAN&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value=&quot;ALB&quot;&gt;ALBANIA&lt;/option&gt;
.
.
.
&lt;/select&gt;

possibly you could have &lt;select type=&quot;iso3166&quot; pattern=&quot;^[A-Z]{3}$&quot;&gt;,
&lt;select type=&quot;iso3166&quot; pattern=&quot;^[A-Z]{2}$&quot;&gt; and &lt;select type=&quot;iso3166&quot;
pattern=&quot;^[0-9]{3}$&quot;&gt; or some such to distinguish between 3-letter,
2-letter, and numeric codes.
