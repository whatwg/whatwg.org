Screen shots are never easy to tell how interactions work, the basic
control may be okay if it was appropriately regionalise (I don't enter
my birthday in YYYY-MM-DD format, I need to just type it as I write it
on forms in my country, it's how my mind works for my birthday.  So
that could work (althought I'm a little unsure about the highlighting
there)

The popup I have other problems with, I find popups extremely
problematical to use, and so would like a way to suggest the open one
is available as the primary input method instead - like the wordpress
calendar blog selector.

(oh and how do you access the open popup, if the first tab takes you
to that open button then I think I'll find it very annoying, and
completely break the expected behaviour of tabbing through forms.

So in conclusion, maybe if it can be configured enough.  As MPT says
though, I want the date to look the same at the beginning and end of
my flight :-)

Jim.
