    Is there a typical time period for a call for comments to last? How
long do various standards organizations wait?

3)

</I>
    That's just four more days...or are you referring to two weeks from
now? Neither would really bother me. I've already spotted a few minor
changes that need to be made after posting the original message in this
thread.

    Still, it seems like the conversation on Web Forms 2.0 has slowed
down enough that perhaps we should start seriously talking about other
things like Web Apps 1.0 use cases and examples for a WF2 test suite. I
guess the real question is when is it too early to start talking about
these things.

</I>
    May want to read the latest draft sooner than later. There were
several question about &lt;datalist&gt; I had for Ian that were answered in
that draft alone.
