</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right, so we have the same result on every other issue, could you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clarify the process document once again to reflect what areas are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus bound, and which are set in stone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The process doesn't involve getting consensus from the mailing list. IT is
</I>&gt;<i> the consensus of the members that at the moment, the work be based on
</I>&gt;<i> consensus on the mailing list. This is all very clearly laid out in the
</I>&gt;<i> process document, and I have been explaining it to you for weeks now.
</I>
Yes but then previously in this thread you refused to discuss
something (well you said it's &quot;not up for discussion&quot; ) so no,
everything is not consensus if there are areas which are not up for
consensus - Because of that, can we be told explicitly which bits are
&quot;not up for discussion&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; I read that as saying that no XML profile is appropriate for WF2 -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since XML by definition requires that non-WF documents are a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; catastophic fail.  So the WF2 work doesn't follow that principle of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. Terrible, isn't it?
</I>
I'm not sure that's really an appropriate answer, could you actually
answer the point - Why if the whole basis of the work is from that
paper are we not following the principles laid out in it?

&gt;<i> &gt; So I look forward to the removal of the XHTML mess (something that a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of people on the list have already agreed with)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What XHTML mess?
</I>
Er, rather forgetful this morning aren't we:
