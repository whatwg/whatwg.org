Count me as a dissenter, then. I disagree that the W3C is the *only* 
sensible orginsation to submit this to. It's the 'obvious' choice, sure, but 
it's not the only choice, and I think that most of the people using the term 
'W3C' when talking about eventual submittal would probably also agree with 
'whoever it turns out to be'. 

Another choice might be ISO, who've standardised a variant of HTML. 

Don't take references to 'W3C' as explicit confirmation that the writer 
means 'and no other'; they're probably just running with the assumption (as 
I am) that W3C would be a good, default, first port-of-call. But not 'W3C or 
nothing', and perhaps not even W3C, if there's sufficient consensus when we 
get that far. 

Regards,
Malcolm
