No, obviously not typos, but anything substantive, yes. (and it'll be
easy to know if it's substantive or not from the context you made the
decision.)

Of course, if you aren't prepared to do the work, then that's fine, I
now understand the process is not an open process, nor was it ever
supposed to be.

&gt;<i> There is no point me wasting everyone's time saying &quot;oh by the way I

</I>
Of course not, neither have I asked for it, that's not a decision,
it's an editorial change.

&gt;<i> Every post raising an issue to this list gets a reply. (I've got a backlog

</I>&gt;<i> those yet, and I have a few days of Web Forms ones to go through still,

Could you regularly mention the date you're up to on WF2 issues
please, so we can see if issues have been missed, or if you're simply
not up to them yet?

Jim.
