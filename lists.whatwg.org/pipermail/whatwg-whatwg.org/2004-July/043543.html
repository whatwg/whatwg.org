Several people have proposed this, so maybe we should indeed do this.

If someone wants to take responsability for setting up and maintaining a
Bugzilla, Wiki, FAQ, or other collaborative system for discussion,
information tracking, issue tracking, or whatever, let me know.

It should be noted, though, that I will be using the mailing list to go
through issues and respond to questions, so such a system would be in a
supportive role, not the primary issue tracking system. In particular, I
wouldn't be going through Bugzilla bugs marking them FIXED for each typo
that people report. I would, however, be happy to use a system that
summarised all the suggestions for a particular feature, when looking at
designing a feature. For example, when we added the combo box support, it
would have been nice to have one page listing all the use cases, all the
requirements, all the suggestions, and all the pros and cons of each
suggestion, as well as any supporting data people had reported on how UAs
handled various kinds of markup.

I would, however, encourage such a system to give links into the mailing
list archives for each piece of information, saying where it was from.


&gt;<i> It would also help people understand why something was rejected.
</I>
Yeah, that would be very useful.


&gt;<i> For instance, people could go to a web page that has a list of topics
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;hiding legacy code&quot;, then click on the &quot;&lt;ignore&gt;&quot;  suggestion and
</I>&gt;<i> see not only my idea for the &lt;ignore&gt; element, but Ian's reasoning for
</I>&gt;<i> why it should not be included. People could then add their own thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> on the matter.
</I>
I would rather their thoughts be primarily added to the mailing list, but
I agree that it would be great to also have an explanation on a site
somewhere (e.g. notes.whatwg.org) that explained all this.


So. If people want to do this, let me know, and I'll provide you with the
necessary basic technical support.

Cheers,
