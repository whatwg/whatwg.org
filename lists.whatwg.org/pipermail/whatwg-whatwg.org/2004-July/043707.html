<PRE>jim,

are you suggesting that we use the &lt;object&gt; tag for all new elements? or 
just as an alternative to &lt;datalist&gt;?

can you provide some code examples to support the text below? because to 
me, the fact that the &lt;object&gt; tag does not show up in the DOM is a 
show-stopper. how do you know which &lt;form&gt; contains the &lt;object&gt; if it 
is not in the DOM?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me clarify the advantages of the OBJECT approach as I see them:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They'll work with HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 content, no need for people
</I>&gt;<i> to learn new elements, or a new DTD at the top, which also means no
</I>&gt;<i> need to get a new validator (or convince the validator people to all
</I>&gt;<i> update their packaged DTD's etc.), in fact no need to write a new DTD.
</I>&gt;<i> All in all much less new stuff to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They allow people to degrade the content in any way they see fit, they
</I>&gt;<i> can provide better input elements than a text element to anyone, even
</I>&gt;<i> without using any script, or even just by using their existing
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, the pages could in fact be modified purely by wrapping parts
</I>&gt;<i> in OBJECT elements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't overload the input element, this simplifies the server portion
</I>&gt;<i> of the script, it knows if it's getting the object named submission or
</I>&gt;<i> the legacy content, so can immediately fork the validation routines
</I>&gt;<i> there.    They should be simpler for the WF2 client, as it knows valid
</I>&gt;<i> input will a valid ISO date time for example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Accessibility is improved, you can provide user help with entering the
</I>&gt;<i> data only in the legacy case - very important as we have seen with
</I>&gt;<i> datetime, where so far the fallback is rudimentary at best.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It can be implemented easily in binary plug-in extension - I realise
</I>&gt;<i> this isn't a requirement, but a binary plugin for IE would be much
</I>&gt;<i> better than a script one, with the new element approach, the only
</I>&gt;<i> option is a binary behaviour, and they need author support so to get
</I>&gt;<i> into the page.   OBJECT doesn't have any such limitation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and the disadvantage of this mark-up ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yeah - it doesn't appear in the IE6 DOM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> there are probably others, but I've not been able to think of any -
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm pretty pessimistic about proposals, as I'm sure people have
</I>&gt;<i> seen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments in CIWAH seem to agree with me:
</I>&gt;<i> see message id: <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">er8of0pojpnri5urc4ima5307q4jqjqrte at 4ax.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really think this should be reconsidered, and proper arguments
</I>&gt;<i> favouring new elements, and overriding input further be looked at
</I>&gt;<i> against this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jim.
