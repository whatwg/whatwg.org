That's a presumptive definition of &quot;seriously&quot;. In the long run, it 
*may* be the case that treating XHTML as tag soup is the only &quot;serious&quot; 
way of doing it. (I know that's a heated debate that doesn't belong on 
this list, but it's probably heated because the answer's not yet 
obvious enough for &quot;seriously&quot; to mean anything.)

&gt;<i> The reason why it is bogus is that including a DTD by reference and 
</I>&gt;<i> pasting it inline are supposed to be equivalent for validating XML 
</I>&gt;<i> processor and in the latter case you don't see a public identifier for

</I>&gt;<i> locating the DTD is just plain wrong. Of course, sane real-world XHTML 
</I>&gt;<i> user agents use non-validating XML processors which makes the 
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion of the doctype declaration rather pointless.
</I>
So do any real-world XHTML UAs handle a DTD pasted inline, or is this 
just a theoretical argument?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Now, similar argumentation does not work on the HTML side if we agree 
</I>&gt;<i> not to pretend that real SGML is being processed. Doctype sniffing is 
</I>&gt;<i> a tag soup solution to a tag soup problem.
</I>
That's an extrapolation from a single data point. The only use of 
doctype sniffing *so far* has been to handle quirky style/layout 
expectations of old pages (and in the case of table style inheritance, 
they wouldn't even need to be tag-soup pages). In the long run, doctype 
sniffing may become a general-purpose method of changing *any* 
undesired behavior (whether de-facto or de-jure) of old syntax in new 
spec versions.

&gt;<i> Still, doctype sniffing is already confusing and convoluted enough for 
</I>&gt;<i> casual authors. (See <A HREF="http://iki.fi/hsivonen/doctype.html">http://iki.fi/hsivonen/doctype.html</A> for subtle 
</I>&gt;<i> differences between user agents.)  I think perturbing it further is a 
</I>&gt;<i> bad idea.
</I>
Sure, but it may be unavoidable, just like it is with natural 
languages. (Try running &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; through a Modern English 
spellchecker or grammar checker, for example.)

&gt;<i> Besides, you can't force the existing installed base of browsers to do 
</I>&gt;<i> new tricks with doctypes which would mean different defaulting.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Which is probably why Matthew Raymond's proposal doesn't require the 
existing installed base of browsers to change anything.
