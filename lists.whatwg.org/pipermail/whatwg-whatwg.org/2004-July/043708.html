    Wouldn't such an inline script require &lt;script&gt;? That would mean for 
every &lt;object&gt; element, you'd require the web author to remember to put 
in a &lt;script&gt; element.

&gt;<i> This isn't possible with HTC's, I've

</I>
    No, I don't think you did. All I saw was the contents of an &lt;object&gt; 
element wrapped in a &lt;div&gt;, with no explanation of what it was supposed 
to do. I presume you want a script to look for that &lt;div&gt; and implement 
behaviors accordingly, but that still doesn't give you the |form| 
attribute and other WF2 control-related attributes from the &lt;object&gt;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>- that's my problem, even though HTC's are sub-optimal for the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>majority of situations (look at the two proposed examples, neither use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>HTC's)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Proposed examples?

</I>
    Of course. We haven't written the HTC yet, and may I point out that 
the Javascript does not perform everything WF2 does. It's only there as 
something for non-WF2 clients to gracefully degrade to. WF2 doesn't 
forbid Javascript a web page's in legacy user agent support.

&gt;&gt;<i>   I'll defer to Dean on this one, as he is the expert.

</I>&gt;<i> He is _an_ expert, you know what, there are other people who have
</I>&gt;<i> experience in HTC's in the world you know.
</I>
    Thank you for demonstrating just how little you often bring to the 
conversations on this mailing list. I should not have to defend every 
trivial choice of an article (a, the, et cetera).

&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/001205.html">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/001205.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This appears to be a comparison between object and datalist, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a general discussion on Object.
</I>
    Clearly, if &lt;object&gt; is not better than &lt;datalist&gt;, it should not be 
used in its place. If &lt;object&gt; is an inferior solution, it doesn't 
matter how you'd implement it in IE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>(so you'd need the DIV for the HTC solution, whereas the inline script
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>wouldn't need the extra element)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Perhaps you should give us a HTML+Javascript example,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> no time I'm afraid, I feel there's more than enough there for anyone
</I>&gt;<i> with any javascript experience - you don't even need to be competent -
</I>&gt;<i> to create an example.
</I>
    I'm not going to argue your points for you, especially when I don't 
understand what they are. Furthermore, if this code takes up so much of 
your precious time, why do you expect us to have time to do it for you?
