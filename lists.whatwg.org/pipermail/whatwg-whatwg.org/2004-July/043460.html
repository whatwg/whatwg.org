You want XHTML2 and CSS3, which are currently being worked on by the W3C.

The reason that we're working on new things with HTML is that browsers
don't support XHTML2 or CSS3 yet, and they won't for years and years to
come. Even when they do, if large numbers of people still use IE, web
page authors won't be able to design with the new technologies because
IE won't be updated to use them (at least, according to Microsoft, which
says it won't even have XHTML1 and CSS2.1 support in Longhorn).

So what we're doing here is making HTML more useful in the meantime by
providing things that are easy to implement and will degrade nicely in
IE/other older browsers.

(oops, forgot to cc this the first time. Sorry for sending it twice to 
you, Josh :-(  )
