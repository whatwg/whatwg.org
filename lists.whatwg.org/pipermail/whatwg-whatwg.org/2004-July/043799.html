UA's should provide these keybindings for navigating. An example  
application of scripts that should only work in media=&quot;projection&quot; are  
animation scripts. It would be very ugly to have animations active in  
regular screen display.

I agree that documents should be readable on as many as possible devices,  
but I also believe in tailoring documents for specific mediatypes. There  
are huge differences between for instance projection and handheld media,  
so why not try to optimize for both by using specific scripts and style  
rules?

I would like to see that actually... yes, it can be abused terribly, but  
it can also be put to good use.


&gt;<i> I know. I never suggested it was a good idea, but I'm rather pleased

I despise it, but I use it... for lack of better alternative.


&gt;<i> No, the thing that I was objecting to more was that the noun 'medium',

</I>&gt;<i> that 'mediaType' is that likely to be confused with Content-Type, but if

</I>&gt;<i> window.large?&quot;. I know I would.
</I>
window.media ?
