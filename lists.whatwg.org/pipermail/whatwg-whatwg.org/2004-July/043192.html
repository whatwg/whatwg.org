    Is there any real reason that the elements, attribute, etc., in the 
WHAT WG specifications can't be divided up into XHTML 1.1 modules while 
still existing in HTML? I may be ignorant in this regard. Do different 
XHTML modules have different namespaces or something?

</I>
    I generally agree: I greatly prefer semantic elements to 
presentational ones. Allowing style sheets and browser vendors to define 
how various Web App 1.0 controls work is better than having it defined 
by a specification.

&gt;<i>   I think these extensions should be implemented as XHTML modules, as 
</I>&gt;<i> specified in XHTML modularization,
</I>
    I seem to remember Ian saying something about this. Perhaps he could 
chime in on this one.

&gt;<i> however it may also be good if it was 
</I>&gt;<i> extended to a completely standalone markup language, seperate from 
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML; although there are features that will be common between documents 
</I>&gt;<i> and web applications (such as hyperlinks, embedded objects/images, 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting, etc. so it may be best to keep them combined as modules.
</I>
   Wanna form an XUL standardization work group? ;)
