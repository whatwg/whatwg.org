<PRE>(Quotes from the spec)

&gt;<i> Documents that use the new features described in this specification 
</I>&gt;<i> using XHTML or other XML languages over HTTP must be served using an 
</I>&gt;<i> XML MIME type such as application/xml or application/xhtml+xml and 
</I>&gt;<i> must not be served as text/html. [RFC3023] Documents served in this 
</I>&gt;<i> way may contain a DOCTYPE if desired, but this is not required.
</I>
+1 for not placing cargo cult doctype requirements on XHTML.

&gt;<i> datetime
</I>
&gt;<i> a dash (U+002D),
</I>
I suggest calling it a &quot;hyphen&quot; as the official name is HYPHEN-MINUS 
and the common implementations in fonts look like hyphens--not like 
dashes.

&gt;<i> 2.5. Extensions to file upload controls
</I>
&gt;<i>     * UAs should use the list of acceptable types in constructing a 
</I>&gt;<i> filter for a file picker, if one is provided to the user.
</I>
That feature is not likely to be reliably implementable considering 
that real-world systems do not have comprehensive ways of mapping 
between file system type data and MIME types.

&gt;<i>     For text input controls it specifies the maximum length of the 
</I>&gt;<i> input, in terms of numbers of characters. For details on counting 
</I>&gt;<i> string lengths, see [CHARMOD].
</I>
Should UAs use NFC for submissions?

&gt;<i> 2.12. The autocomplete attribute
</I>
I guess this has to exist for banks with weak authentication, high 
paranoia and low clue. :-(

Over here (Finland) we use OTP authentication for banking.

&gt;<i> To prevent an attribute from being processed in this way, put a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-breaking zero-width space character (&amp;#xFEFF;) at the start of the 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.
</I>
Isn't the use of that char as anything but the BOM deprecated or at 
least considered harmful?

&gt;<i> Since square brackets are not allowed in ID attributes in XML, the 
</I>&gt;<i> above example cannot validate to an XML DTD. It is still well-formed, 
</I>&gt;<i> however, and conformant to this specification.
</I>
Can DOM implementations that know about IDness be trusted not to barf 
when creating id attributes with non-ID values?

&gt;<i> Note that a string containing the codepoint's value itself (for 
</I>&gt;<i> example, the six-character string &quot;U+263A&quot; or the seven-character 
</I>&gt;<i> string &quot;&#9786;&quot;) is not considered to be human readable and must not 
</I>&gt;<i> be used as a transliteration.
</I>
Do you expect UAs that already do this change their behavior with the 
legacy submission types?

&gt;<i>       How a UA establishes the page's character encoding is determined 
</I>&gt;<i> by the language specification.
</I>
s/language/markup language/ to avoid confusion with natural language 
metadata.

&gt;<i> 5.4. application/x-www-form+xml: XML submission
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The message entity is an XML 1.0 document, encoded as either UTF-8 or 
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-16 (at the choice of the UA),
</I>
+1 for not allowing encodings that XML processors are not required to 
support.

&gt;<i> which has a root element named &quot;submission&quot;, with no prefix, defining 
</I>&gt;<i> a default namespace uuid:d10e4fd6-2c01-49e8-8f9d-0ab964387e32.
</I>
I think that is an inappropriate attempt to micromanage the syntactic 
details that are in the realm of a lower-level spec. I think the 
submission format should either allow all the syntactic sugar that 
comes with Namespaces in XML or be layered directly on top XML 1.0 
without namespace support.

&gt;<i> UAs must not include an XML declaration
</I>
Again, a higher-level spec should not attempt to restrict the syntactic 
variance allowed by a lower-level spec. The XML declaration is allowed 
by the XML spec.

&gt;<i> but must include a BOM.
</I>
I think that is not a legitimate requirement when UTF-8 is used.

&gt;<i> UAs may use either CDATA blocks, entities, or both in escaping the 
</I>&gt;<i> contents of attributes and elements, as appropriate.
</I>
In order not to imply that this spec could restrict the ways characters 
are escaped, that sentence should be a note rather than part of the 
normative prose. (Of course, only the pre-defined entities are 
available. Then there are NCRs.)

&gt;<i> The resulting XML must be a well-formed XML instance.
</I>
If it is not well-formed, it, by definition, is not &quot;resulting XML&quot;. :-)

&gt;<i> The only mention of namespaces in the submission document must be the 
</I>&gt;<i> declaration of the default namespace on the root element.
</I>
See above.
