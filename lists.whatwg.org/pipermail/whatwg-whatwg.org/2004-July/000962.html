</I>
If consensus can't be reached, then there's good reason for more
discussion (or removal), that's how you get could specs.
 
&gt;<i>    Does a private email to Ian by one of the members saying &quot;the latest
</I>&gt;<i> draft looks fine&quot; rise to the level of being a closed process? 
</I>
It's irrelevant to the process, the communication is defined only
through this mailing list, if a member wishes to express their support
it has to go through the list for Ian to take any notice (that's the
defined process, I've already said I think this is silly, but that's
what's there.)

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Secondly, why can't we just create a Web Forms 2.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Mobile Profile?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because most mobile browsers aren't upgradeable?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Not sure what you mean.
</I>
The current proposals do not apply to XHTML Basic, therefore we cannot
serve our WF2 documents to XHTML Basic UA's. a Mobile Profile of WF2
won't change this for the legacy clients, as they cannot be upgraded.

&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is perception, 3 browser vendors are absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controlling the process, it doesn't appear open currently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    First of all, there are only seven members. How many different
</I>&gt;<i> browser vendors can they represent? 
</I>
I agree it's a disappointingly small number.

&gt;<i> &gt; Competitive advantage by inventing new elements etc. is how the war
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was fought 9 years ago, I think people are right to be suspicious.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Suspicion and reason are not the same thing.
</I>
No, but you seem to be missing the whole thrust of mine, and C
Williams arguments, that perception is incredibly important, it's not
just the reality that matters.

&gt;<i> The Mozilla Foundation didn't exist. Safari didn't exist.
</I>
Not that I actually think it's relevant, but many of the individuals
in the WHAT WG were involved with browsers at the time. (which is good
of course, getting their expertise involved)
 
&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> may simply be that discussion is not open to the public, but there's on
</I>&gt;<i> official secrecy requirement.
</I>

&gt;<i> Stop wasting our time.
</I>
As you keep noting, you don't have to read, or reply.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I've seen your comments, and for those that were rejected (not all
</I>&gt;<i> of them, BTW), I read a rational reason as to why they were rejected.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, your concern about the copyright of the draft was addressed
</I>&gt;<i> when Ian agreed to look into getting the draft put in public domain,
</I>
Something we surely takes a couple of emails to the Opera management,
and legal, hardly something that takes the 4 or so weeks since I've
asked, any progress Ian?
