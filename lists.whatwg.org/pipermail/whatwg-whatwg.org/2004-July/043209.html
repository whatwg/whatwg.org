<PRE>Remember that this is not a specification, it is a working draft of a
specification which (at the moment) is primarily looking for for
comments.

This is a working draft, not a complete specification. Where are the
DTD's / Schemas for other drafts like XHTML 2?

</I>&gt;<i> The spec contains numerous sections which do not belong there.

</I>
Again, at the moment, we are asking for comments on the draft so there
is a good reason to keep it there. It would not be at all productive
if people made comments asking for features listed in this section,
not realizing that they had already been discussed and decided
against. I don't see any reason to keep this in the final spec, but it
certainly makes sense at the moment.

&gt;<i> Some the grammar and punctuation in the document is dubious to
</I>&gt;<i> say the least.
</I>
It's a draft. It's not expected to be perfect. That's why the editor
has requested people to comment on it. If you want to point out
specific problems in the language of the doc (as you did), that's fine
and helpful, but you shouldn't expect everything to be perfect.
