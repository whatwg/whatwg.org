In what way is what I describe above more closed than the W3C? As far as I
can tell, the W3C is not open in _any_ of the ways described above, nor is
it more open than the WHATWG in any way that the WHATWG is closed.

</I>
Yes, the office is closed in every sense except that the door is wide
open. That's like saying &quot;the grocery store is closed other than their
letting customers in for trade&quot;.

We used the word &quot;open&quot; to mean its dictionary definitions that I quoted
above. We did not use it to mean the strange definition that you came up
with, which I believe is better termed a &quot;verbose process&quot; or maybe
&quot;transparent process&quot;, and which is what I assumed you meant by &quot;open&quot;
above. (Unless you are changing definitions half-way through your
argument?) There certainly has never been anything transparent about the
process in which the WWW was created, so why would we claim there had been
in our process document?
