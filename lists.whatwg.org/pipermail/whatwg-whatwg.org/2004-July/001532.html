No one is talking about file access, its access to services.

A XML file named a certain way with a certain syntax.  If you have
SOAP services that don't authenticate in some sort of way, that is
your own problem.  As long as browsers have cross domain issues, you
should always authenticate, even in an intranet.

Oh, and Macromedia Flex, flash based XUL, can set this pref on the
server, meaning any server could set your intranet as a place to do
cross domain calls :)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If they want to restrict, they can use username/passwords to do that,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as does Google.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is orthogonal to the ability of a webbrowser to make the request.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only reason we didn't allow cross domain web services access are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intranets - since mozilla does the actually SOAP connection, user A in

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which talks to an intranet web service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, so you do understand the problem, unfortunately though, you don't

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not secure, and I ask you again, How do I disable this ability

</I>
I still don't see any reason why the Mozilla way is unsecure.  Unless
a magical XML file appears out of nowhere, and an evil.com someone
knew the exact location of a internal webserivce that doesn't
authenticate.

As for a pref to disable this, there is none I believe.  File a bug if
you want one, would be trivial to implement.
