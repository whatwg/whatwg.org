<PRE>I might be misguided, but I believe that PHP has &quot;transparent&quot; session 
tracking using only URLs. I have no idea how it hides it from the 
browser, but from my experience it seems to work pretty damn well, and 
without cookies... I believe that would be the job of the web server 
though, and not the markup language. Can anyone shed a little more 
light on this? - Ryan

</I>&gt;<i> site developers could use it if they needed.  What I think is nice

</I>&gt;<i> google, etc.  The cookie problem goes away (where sites track you from 
</I>&gt;<i> site to site) and ugly urls become a thing of the past.  The browser

</I>&gt;<i> visiting with a session id and not that damn tracking graphic

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bad guy&quot;.  (you know, the reason people stopped trusting cookies to 
</I>&gt;<i> begin with)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really think this is a great idea and could work.  I also think it
