Oh, so the audience for Web Applications, is not about for backwards
compatibility?    in that case there are other specs available to do
the job, no need to bother it.

Yep, and there are more XForms 1.0 implementations than any other W3
spec when it went to Rec.  It doesn't mean any of them are successful.
   There is certainly nothing remotely deployed and working using WF2,
even lots of the samples don't work in IE6.

Jim.
