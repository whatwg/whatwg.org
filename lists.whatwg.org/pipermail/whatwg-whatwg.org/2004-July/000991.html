A different classid is hardly problematical, it's just a URI, I know
use an urn (which Ian rightly says isn't appropriate) but that was for
political reasons, not wanting to presuppose what domain would be
appropriate, maybe I should've just used an example.com one.

&gt;<i>. It also doesn't give a default value, but then you could use

Yep, works for me.


&gt;<i>    The main problem I see with this is that you can't reuse a single
</I>&gt;<i> list in multiple controls, which &lt;datalist&gt; allows. 
</I>
But WF2 gives us the ability to populate our lists with external data
files, so I don't think this is much of a problem.

&gt;<i> Also, this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> degrade with an &lt;input&gt;, so there's no way to enter text on legacy clients.
</I>
That was just 'cos I chopped it out (if it was in the original I
copied) you could of course put one in!

Jim.
