</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The files attribute of the input element is currently marked readonly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [1], to protect from `myInput.files = &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;; myForm.submit()`.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since its type is now FileList and not string, that's no longer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Making the attribute writable would allow setting the files property
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of an input element to dataTransfer.files from a drop handler. For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, I would like to use this to create a larger drop-target for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file input. Here's one request for this functionality:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8006715/drag-drop-files-into-standard-html-file-input">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8006715/drag-drop-files-into-standard-html-file-input</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can the readonly restriction be removed from the spec?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think simply marking the attribute as writable is the correct
</I>&gt;<i> solution here. At the very least we should make it possible to assign
</I>&gt;<i> a sequence&lt;File&gt; to the attribute such that you can do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> myInput.files = [file1];
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But even a sequence&lt;Blob&gt; should be allowed IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Makes sense to me. Can we just kill FileList and always use File[] (or
&quot;readonly File[]&quot; for the readonly cases)? The only cases where this is
used in the HTML spec are file inputs and dataTransfer. We should make
setting a non-readonly T[] to a sequence&lt;T&gt; work across the platform IMO.

Allowing setting a sequence&lt;Blob&gt; could be made to transparently work as a
followup, no? You should be able to just set myInput.files =
myBlobSequence. As Anne points out, it's unclear what the UI for this would
be.

Jonas, if killing FileList and using File[] makes sense to you, I'm happy
to send an email to public-webapps to that effect for the File API spec.


&gt;<i> One concern I have though is that this is pretty problematic UI-wise.
</I>&gt;<i> Simply displaying the .name (if it's a file) property in the UI seems
</I>&gt;<i> like a good way to scare people into thinking that they have attached
</I>&gt;<i> something that they didn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What exactly is the concern here? Is it a security concern? If it's just a
correctness concern, then it's on the web page to do something sane with
the API. I don't think the API is especially inviting the page to do things
that would confuse the user. For example, in Nico's case, it's actually the
same set of files the user-dropped, it just widens the drop-target. I would
imagine things like this would be how nearly everyone would use this.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems like making FileList mutable would serve the same use case and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Making it a File[] instead of a FileList could allow you to set the whole
thing or modify it. There are legit use-cases for both and supporting both
isn't terribly difficult.
