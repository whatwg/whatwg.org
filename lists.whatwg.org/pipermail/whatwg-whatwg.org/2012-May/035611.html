<PRE>I know it's contentious, but as a teacher it's very simple to teach 
students of HTML5 that:
&lt;u&gt; = underline
&lt;b&gt; = bold
&lt;i&gt; = italic
&lt;s&gt; = strikethrough

Of course, I also teach &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;, but the simplest way to teach 
&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; is that it's merely an easy way to create bold or italic 
text when the meaning of &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; doesn't apply. They represent 
a convenience that spares the author the work of using span tags and 
creating a CSS class with font-weight or font-style properties. &lt;u&gt; is 
the same, just an easy way to create underlined text. It doesn't really 
need semantics piled on top of it - that just makes it harder to teach 
and learn. But using Chinese names or misspelled text as /examples/ of 
when to use &lt;u&gt; is another matter.

I grok the desire to have all tags defined semantically, but if the 
semantic definitions add unnecessary complexity, then it just seems like 
a kludge. Anyone can understand &lt;b&gt; = bold.
