&gt;&gt;<i> Media queries come from the client side. They allow the author of a web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page to tell exactly how she want to lay out her design based on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different queries. The browser *HAS* to follow these queries. And also,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think (please correct me if wrong) the media query can be subset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to only the stuff that's really meaningful to do at prefetch-time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The srcset proposal, on the other hand, are purely HINTS to the browser
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engine about the resources. They are only declarative hints that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leveraged in a secret sauce way (like Bruce said in another mail) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always optimize image fetching and other features. If you make a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of browser (like e.g. Opera mini) it can have its own heuristics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that make sense *for that single browser* without asking _anyone_.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Without relying on web authors doing the correct thing, or changing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything or even announce to anyone what they are doing. It's opening up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for innovation, good algorithms and smart uses in the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's the basic difference, totally different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that's the case, would it make sense to get rid of the @media
</I>&gt;<i> attribute on &lt;source&gt; elements in &lt;video&gt; and replace it with @srcset?
</I>
Video is at least a bit different in that you don't expect it to be fully  
loaded and prefetch at such an early stage as img. But I've been thinking  
about that since I read something like &quot;we already have media queries in  
source for video, but it's not really implemented and used yet&quot;.

I'm not sure. What do you think? As far as I've seen, you're highly  
knowledgeable about &lt;video&gt;. Why do we have mediaqueries on video element?  
Do we have a use case page? Doing the same as whatever &lt;img&gt; ends up doing  
might be a good fit if the use cases are similar enough. Would be nice to  
be consistent if that makes sense.
