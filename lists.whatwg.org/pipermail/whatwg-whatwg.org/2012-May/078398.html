<PRE>Tab, Thanks for going to effort of providing some clear and detailed notes about this.
I think the rest of the committee could learn from this account, and perhaps consider theres a lot more to communication than editing a live-spec and dumping it into the mailing list.

The public has largely resigned this to &#8220;`srcset` is happening because the WHATWG said so,&#8221; for certain, and that doesn&#8217;t seem entirely false&#8212;but I don&#8217;t think &#8220;hopeless acceptance&#8221; is the situation at present. I&#8217;ve been off the grid for a few days, but as I catch up on the conversation it seems as though a number of the RICG&#8217;s members have been contributing to the incremental improvement of the `srcset` proposal. I&#8217;m all for it, of course, as the goal was never _this or that_ solution so much as a solution that covers our use cases in the most developer-friendly way possible&#8212;and above all else, a solution with the most benefit to users.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The goal now&#8212;as ever&#8212;is the best possible solution. If we&#8217;re limited to `srcset`, then the goal is to make that as useful as possible. However, I&#8217;d be lying if I said it isn&#8217;t frustrating, feeling as though we&#8217;re all working from a forgone conclusion.
