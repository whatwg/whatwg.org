</I>
What's the use case?

Are there any native platforms that have a concept of a read-only radio 
button or checkbox that isn't disabled?

Yeah. I'm not sure I would add readonly to text input controls if it 
didn't already exist.

That's a use case for submitting disabled check boxes, not for read-only 
checkboxes, IMHO. (The same could be said for disabled text controls.)

</I>&gt;<i> or not. I have no objection in principle to such a state, but:

</I>&gt;<i> - readonly seems like a poor name for this state, since in the case of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The fact that older browsers wouldn't support this special state makes

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;submit anyway&quot; would do a better job of degrading gracefully, but would 
</I>&gt;<i> mean that for a while, authors have to do the hidden input trick as 
</I>&gt;<i> fallback anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given these things and the relative obscurity of the use case (UIs where

</I>
I agree with all the above.

</I>
You should always check the data on the server and not trust the client to 
get it right. The client could be completely untrusted.

But in any case, as Maciej says, you can store the data in a hidden input 
if you're doing things with script anyway. It's a two-line function to 
abstract out the logic of checking/unchecking a checkbox and updating a 
hidden input at the same time.

</I>
It doesn't sound like a checkbox control if it's not interactive. In 
similar situations, I've just made the table display the data with &lt;span&gt;s 
and characters or graphics for the status (check marks, etc), with the 
data stored in &lt;input type=hidden&gt; controls for submission. I think that's 
probably the better approach here.
