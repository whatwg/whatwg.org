You don't really need a colour picker for that... it's more a &lt;select&gt; 
than a colour picker. Or a series of radio buttons. If the presentation is 
more the concern, then we should probably rely on Web Components to solve 
the problem (styling a &lt;select&gt; with a new presentation, e.g.).


&gt;<i> While searching the list archives, I found a message from Ian Hickson: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-November/017482.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-November/017482.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> He suggested to use a select element for the purpose of a restricted 
</I>&gt;<i> color set.
</I>
Good to know I'm consistent. :-D (I wrote the reply to the above paragraph 
before reading this paragraph!)


&gt;<i> Here's why I think it would be worth to reconsider this position:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A select element would display color names or values instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> showing the colors, which does not make it a suitable UI for choosing 
</I>&gt;<i> colors.
</I>
That's a presentation issue, though. We should let CSS and/or Web 
Components fix that; we shouldn't add new semantics for each desired 
presentation.


&gt;<i> - Restricting the color palette is actually almost as common a task, as 
</I>&gt;<i> defining start and end dates of a date picker, and for sure more common 
</I>&gt;<i> than defining a step in a date picker. Now we have the benefit of this 
</I>&gt;<i> specialized color input element, it is a pity if it lacks customization 
</I>&gt;<i> potential.
</I>
The step in the date picker is something that was basically supported just 
because we had to define what step=&quot;&quot; did anyway since we had it for 
numbers.

I don't disagree that it might make sense to limit the colour palette 
(e.g. &quot;only things with a brightness greater than 50%&quot;) for type=color. 
But that's a different use case, and a different feature, than the one 
given above.


&gt;<i> - The fact that most CMS do not have restricted color sets so far, does 
</I>&gt;<i> not mean there is no demand for it, but rather shows the difficulty of 
</I>&gt;<i> customizing tools such as TinyMCE. It is a hassle for CMS implementors 
</I>&gt;<i> (who are often not highly skilled JS programmers), if they are expected 
</I>&gt;<i> to respect corporate design guidelines.
</I>
I don't follow. Right now (before type=color is widely implemented) it's 
easier to provide a limited set of colours than all colours. Surely then 
we should see more CMSes have restricted colour sets if it's a matter of 
difficulty.


&gt;<i> - I assume that restricting a color set in an existing color picker is 
</I>&gt;<i> not too hard to implement (of course I have no evidence for this 
</I>&gt;<i> assumption).
</I>
That's, generally speaking, not a concern.

</I>&gt;<i> For example, consider a date picker. Quite often, whether trying to make

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/datalist&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is currently conforming, though no browser seems to make use of the 
</I>&gt;<i> datalist. A good implementation would open up a calendar for April, with 
</I>&gt;<i> only days 1, 8, 9 selectable and day 1 highlighted. Many existing 
</I>&gt;<i> applications use such interfaces, so there is apparent need for them.
</I>
It certainly exists. How common it is, I don't know. It's a subset of 
sites with date pickers, which itself is a pretty small subset of sites 
with forms, which is a subset of pages.

It's definitely something worth keeping in mind though as we look to 
where we might extend this feature. I haven't added it yet, because we're 
still not at a point where these form controls are very mature.

If anyone wants this particular feature prioritised, a good way to start 
would be documenting existing sites that have date pickers that do this 
kind of thing.

</I>
This isn't a complete picture. Sure, browsers won't automatically render a 
&lt;select&gt; in a manner specific to the data type of the values. But with 
some CSS and Web Component definitions, that can be changed. A &lt;select&gt; 
with countries could render as a map, a &lt;select&gt; with dates as a custom 
calendar, a &lt;select&gt; with colours as a custom colour picker.

The point is that at the HTML level, the &lt;select&gt; element has the right 
semantics: pick one from a list. What is is presented as is a separate 
concern for a higher level of the stack.

If you just have one time spam, &lt;input type=date&gt; already supports that.

That's a pretty complex widget. I don't know that we'd want an HTML 
primitive to support this kind of thing; it might be best to just let 
authors develop their own for that.

That's pretty crazy, using a string pattern matching tool to do 
range-checking on structured numeric data. :-P
