</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's easy to see how the experience you describe below would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frustrating. FWIW, I routinely feel frustration at seemingly wasted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it's inescapable that reaching consensus can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exhausting, especially via email -- and doing so always requires
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-explaining the same thing multiple times in multiple ways. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> true for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, there will always be an element of this - although in the case
</I>&gt;<i> of the CG this got to the point that we addressed it with a FAQ page.
</I>&gt;<i> That helped us and people visiting. It didn't seem to help the WG, for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fairness to Hixie -- being an editor is fairly thankless and he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does a remarkable job of keeping up even just with whatwg, webapps and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a few others (I gave up long ago). If you need someone to understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something, it's best to directly bring it to their attention. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet is a big place =-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see both sides of this. When you're busy, you're busy, and Hixie
</I>&gt;<i> is busy. On the other hand, this was a long drawn out multi-month
</I>&gt;<i> problem that was talked about quite literally everywhere. It's the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that the scope of awareness everywhere else was so large that
</I>&gt;<i> makes it so surprising it was missed in the one group that it ought to
</I>&gt;<i> have been forefront of that subject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree with both Jonas and Maciej's points above about lessons for the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems like the basic problem is that a feature which needs lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work collecting use cases and developer feedback requires a setting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which isn't intimidating for developers -- but ultimately, if it wants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to land in a spec, it needs the perspective and experience of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementors and editors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we all agree on that :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A few humble thoughts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -Have the CG recruit an experienced implementor or editor to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participate more or less from the beginning. This may short-circuit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time spent on solutions that won't work for esoteric reasons, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there will be at least one person with one foot in both worlds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be awesome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -Cross-post significant outputs &amp; decisions to whatwg, public-webapps,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc... E.g. collected use cases, strawman proposals, recommendations,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc... Even with the help of an implementors/editor, the ideas that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> survive are those that withstand the scrutiny of the entire community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and getting that scrutiny early is nearly always better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cross posting is always risky. If the items under discussion are still
</I>&gt;<i> maliable then what happens is two discussions break out between two
</I>&gt;<i> lots of un-related groups and things get messy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be up for this route only if it was very clear of the role of each
</I>&gt;<i> party, and lines could be drawn that properly segment the discussions.
</I>&gt;<i> i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) CG: &quot;We have collected enough use cases from a wide spread of
</I>&gt;<i> authors; we are now presenting this back to the WHATWG - if you wish
</I>&gt;<i> to follow along with possible solutions, please take part there&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 2) WG: discusses possible solutions and *whenever* there is doubt
</I>&gt;<i> about what an author would prefer to do or what they will understand,
</I>&gt;<i> it gets bounced back to the CG
</I>&gt;<i> 3) CG: present the WG's dilema in a succinct way that presumes no
</I>&gt;<i> prior knowledge, and solicit feedback from authors outside of the WG
</I>&gt;<i> list, which is then fed back to the WG.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) WG: makes decisions based on that feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That to me would work best for both communities.
</I>
I think the sentiment behind these to good, but I'd caution against
relying on process and specified roles.

The goal here shouldn't be to slice up areas of responsibility -- that
seems likely to contribute to -- not mitigate -- people digging in
their heels. It's a good feature that anyone can wear whatever hat
they like.

My observation is that when good stuff happens, it's because a set of
people dedicate themselves dispassionately to doing whatever required
to pursue a good outcome -- not because of any formal process which is
ultimately unenforceable.
