I'd like to throw in another use-case that might be addressable by the
same feature: allowing &quot;Save As...&quot; to save a different version of the
image (e.g., higher-res) than is actually displayed.  Wikipedia, for
instance, often has very high-res images that get scaled down for
article viewing to save bandwidth and avoid possibly-ugly rescaling.
(At least historically, some browsers used very bad rescaling
algorithms.)  It would be nice if when users saved the image, they
saved the full-res version.  Perhaps browsers could save the
highest-res image available, rather than the one that happens to be
used for display right now.

Another obvious use-case I'd like to point out is print.  It's not
quite as trendy as the iPhone Retina display -- in fact maybe it's
getting pass&#233; :) -- but print is generally higher-res than display,
and it's common for images to appear pixelated when printing.  This
use-case might have the same requirements as the iPhone Retina
display, but it should be kept in mind in case it doesn't.

A fourth use-case I'd like to suggest is vector images.  Last I
checked, many authors don't want to serve SVG directly because too
many browsers don't support it in &lt;img&gt; (or at all).  Perhaps it
should be possible to specify &quot;vector&quot; or something in place of a
scale factor, to indicate that the image should be suitable for all
resolutions.  (A possible problem with this: very detailed SVGs can be
much larger than the equivalent bitmaps, so the bandwidth tradeoff
might not always be good.  But authors can worry about that
themselves, I guess, and not specify such vector images as possible
sources.)

It's possible that the best solution won't accommodate all of these
use-cases, but I'm just throwing them out here so that they can be
taken into account.
