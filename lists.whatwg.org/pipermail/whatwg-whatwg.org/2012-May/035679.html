</I>
In general there's no reason the browser couldn't accept input from a 
barcode reader for any input, even a colour picker if there's some sort of 
colour barcode format. We don't have a special input type for keyboards vs 
mice vs trackballs vs touch screen devices vs speech recognition vs chord 
keyboards vs eye tracking. Why would we do something special for barcode 
readers? They're just another input device.

Certainly Web Intents would be a relevant feature here.

It wouldn't allow it any more than it is already allowed.

That's already supported, though.

</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but barcodes are a technical aspect of input rather than data

</I>&gt;<i> it knows what to expect). Moreover, the word &quot;barcode&quot; has multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> meanings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think that if the input of data commonly available as simple linear 
</I>&gt;<i> barcodes deserves a type of its own in HTML, it should be analyzed which 
</I>&gt;<i> logical data type would be involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the GTIN product codes (still often called EAN codes 
</I>&gt;<i> especially when in barcode format, or TUN or DUN codes) are in wide and 
</I>&gt;<i> increasing use and might be considered for inclusion. A browser could 
</I>&gt;<i> implement an input type for them using a barcode reader when available, 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise using some method for input of digits together with checksum 
</I>&gt;<i> checking. This would be useful, though I don't know whether it's worth 
</I>&gt;<i> the specification and implementation effort (and things like this won't 
</I>&gt;<i> be really useful except after several years when all significant 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers have real support).
</I>
Things like the checksum checking can easily be done in the page itself. I 
don't see that there's much need for the UA to do it natively.

I agree that this seems like, at most, an input mode hint.
