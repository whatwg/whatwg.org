<PRE>Oh, please do quote what you are answering. It's very hard to follow
such a conversation like this.

I could be more clear. I believe this is what you are talking about:

I said:
&gt;<i> media queries is doing model 2. I suggest we find a way to do that with
</I>&gt;<i> javascript. Maybe some form of deferring image loading at all, saying
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;I will fetch image on my own&quot;. Then you can do the delayed image
</I>&gt;<i> loading that would need to happen in a media query world.
</I>
When I say find a way to defer it, I mean spec a way to do it, and
implement that. Something like:

     &lt;img defer src=&quot;blabla.jpg&quot;&gt;

I understand the problem :-)

&gt;<i> Also, i don't think non-pixel based layouts can be easily dismissed.
</I>&gt;<i> It's where the whole movement is going and already pixel based MQ are
</I>&gt;<i> described as limited and not a best practice.
</I>
... But it doesn't work. Please read my emails, and come with
constructive technical feedback on why you think it *can* in fact work.
I can not see a method where that would work in an non-broken way.

Technical problems won't just magically go away by not acknowlegding
them.


And I did find a way forward for the model 2, make a way to defer the
image load and find a way to load it. Maybe &lt;picture&gt; element should
always defer? It actually *has to* because it uses media queries, so in
fact, &lt;picture&gt; might be a solution for model 2 in the future.

But @srcset is solving the other part of the equation (model 1).
