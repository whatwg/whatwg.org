The spec says _exactly_ what it means. You do not need to ever read 
between the lines. Here, the paragraph only says that modifying the 
attribute has no effect. It doesn't say anything else. It doesn't say that 
if the environment changes, anything happens. It doesn't say that if the 
phase of the moon is &quot;full&quot;, that the video should play backwards. 
Presumably you haven't interpreted it to suggest that you should play 
backwards in a full moon. :-) The same applies to anything else.

Furthermore, the paragraph you quote above is non-normative. The paragraph 
doesn't say anything with a &quot;must&quot;, it doesn't define any terms. It 
therefore can not in any way affect what an implementation does.


&gt;<i> Support for the second interpretation :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To change what is playing, just use the src attribute on the media 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; element directly, possibly making use of the canPlayType() method to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pick from amongst available resources.
</I>
This paragraph is not normative either. Again, it has no conformance 
criteria (&quot;must&quot;) and doesn't define anything.

Please, as an implementor, ignore everything that isn't a conformance 
criteria.


&gt;<i> The &quot;just&quot; word here seems to imply modifying the src attribute of the 
</I>&gt;<i> audio or video parent is the only way to change the media that is 
</I>&gt;<i> playing. By deduction, media attributes of children source elements 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot change a the source that is currently playing.
</I>
If at any time you are finding yourself worrying about what hte spec 
implies, or deducing anything about what the spec means, stop, you don't 
ever have to do that. :-)


The only place in the spec that is in any way affected by the &quot;media&quot; 
attribute on the &lt;source&gt; element (other than the .media IDL attribute) is 
step 6, substep 6, of the &quot;resource selection algorithm&quot;. The only time, 
therefore, that you should ever be affected by the media=&quot;&quot; attribute, is 
when you reach that step in your implementation. There is nothing that 
causes that to happen when the environment changes.
