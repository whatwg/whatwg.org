</I>
I'm not sure where you got that idea; no one has said that bandwidth
detection is impossible.  We've merely said that it's *hard*, and it
involves much more than a simple &quot;what's the instantaneous bandwidth
right now?&quot;.  Opera Turbo, for example, has high/low bandwidth
detection for deciding what behavior to use.  It was very difficult to
get it right, but I presume they've settled on a decent solution now.

*Because* it's hard, we shouldn't put the problem in the hands of
devs.  It's better to solve it a handful of times in browsers, than to
expect ten thousand individual developers to all solve the problem
correctly.


&gt;&gt;<i> UAs are also free to download 1x image first, and then 2x image after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> onload, etc. Declarative nature of descriptors, as opposed to imperative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MQs, allows UAs to innovate in this area and come up with new uses that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors didn't predict/express in MQ.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be no better than current JS approaches, in fact making it
</I>&gt;<i> worse by adding to the page load size rather than optimising it.
</I>
No, it's definitely better, because, as already stated, the browser
can make these sorts of decisions intelligently.  Grabbing the
cheapest assets for a fast load then swapping them out when a slow
load is less noticeable is a smart decision if the bandwidth supports
it.


&gt;&gt;<i> The syntax allows addition of &quot;KB&quot; descriptor later, which &#8212; assuming UAs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will figure out how to measure actual bandwidth well enough &#8212; will allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even more sophisticated selection based on file size (rather than only 1x/2x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scale factors which are only a proxy for the file size).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As above; this seems set not to happen. Besides, how is it going to
</I>&gt;<i> know the file size unless you explicitly state it in the srcset
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere?
</I>
I'm not sure I understand the question.  He's talking about a
descriptor that lets you explicitly state the file size.
