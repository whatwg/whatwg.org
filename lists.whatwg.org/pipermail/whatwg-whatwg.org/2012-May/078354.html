<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Make no mistake; this is not a pride or attachment thing, this is a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knowing the reasons thing. I personally don't think &lt;picture&gt; answers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> things well enough, nor do I think srcset does. Not for general use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cases - but for specific one-off use cases, each has benefits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Absolutely. And from what I read (and I admit not reading the entire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> archive of messages, but still, prefer to say my piece anyway) the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main concern about picture was the potencial verbosity. Instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to solve this issue, it got discarded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;picture&gt; in its current form is unable to support bandwidth-based
</I>&gt;<i> negotiation well
</I>
By all accounts no solution proposed can do this. This is not a
&lt;picture&gt; only problem.

&gt;<i> (and that's not simply a matter of adding bandwidth media
</I>&gt;<i> query) and has no mechanism to specify scaling factor for intrinsic sizes of
</I>&gt;<i> images.
</I>
Not actually sure what &quot;intrinsic sizes of images&quot; means.

&gt;<i> IMHO those are pretty serious drawbacks that limit its functionality, which
</I>&gt;<i> is much worse than &quot;ugly, but gets job done&quot; state of srcset.
</I>
I see no difference between the end result of either syntax. Both
approaches fail utterly in abstracting the query from the mark-up,
which means both approaches are suited only to individual images.
Should the design of the site change at any point, both solutions
break completely. It's a major problem I pointed out with &lt;picture&gt;
over in the CG. Srcset is no better in this regard.

&gt;<i> There are two categories of use-cases (&quot;art-directed&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dpi/optimization&quot;) and &lt;picture&gt; is suited for only one of them, so please
</I>&gt;<i> don't frame the decision as &quot;discarding&quot; of a perfectly good solution, as it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't.
</I>
Picture dealt with both of these by simple use of the pixel density
media query - i.e, in exactly the same way CSS already does it. I do
not understand your argument.

&gt;<i> srcset addresses both dpi/optimisation and art-directed use-cases. It has
</I>&gt;<i> its own problems, such as confusing microsyntax, so suggestions how to
</I>&gt;<i> improve this are welcome.
</I>
Agreed, and already underway.

&gt;<i> Lamenting &lt;picture&gt; and accusing WHATWG of wrongdoing is not productive.
</I>
With respect, finding out where there have been fuck-ups is in
everyone's interest if we want to get the most out of the process and
communities who are all trying to better the web.

&gt;<i> If you'd like to see &lt;picture&gt; proposal succeed, then please help fixing its
</I>&gt;<i> drawbacks.
</I>
I've said I don't. No part of my argument said I condone continued
argument for supporting picture - I in fact said I don't like it and
haven't liked it since it was in the CG.

&gt;<i> Make selection and embedding of 2x images easier.
</I>&gt;<i> Give UA freedom
</I>&gt;<i> to use cached higher-quality images when it can. Give UA freedom to choose
</I>&gt;<i> images to minimize bandwidth or maximize quality. Reduce verbosity of most
</I>&gt;<i> common cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to raise those issues on the Responsive Images group's
</I>&gt;<i> mailinglist, but got no constructive feedback.
</I>
That last bit is annoying. Some of the key players in that group seem
to ignore stuff since they decided &lt;picture&gt; was finished - I've had
the same problem myself.
