The solution I've seen proposed[1] only aliases media query content, and  
works only on a per-page basis, so it doesn't allow automatic addition of  
a new image size site-wide, since you have to insert new &lt;source&gt; into  
every &lt;picture&gt; anyway.

To me it looks like about the same amount of work as inserting new pixel  
size into every srcset.


What solution do you have in mind that would let you add a 'tv' breakpoint  
site-wide for all images that have been prepared for it, without need to  
update code that embeds those images? And is that really saving much  
effort? Wouldn't you have to revisit every page anyway to test the new  
layout?
