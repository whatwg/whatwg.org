This isn't a new suggestion, but worth repeating: starting a CG is fine,
but *do not make a new mailing list*.  Hold discussions on a related
monolithic list (like here or webapps), with a subject line prefix.  Making
lots of isolated mailing lists only ensures that the people you'd want
paying attention won't be, because the overhead of subscribing to a list
(for a subject people may only have passive interest in) is much higher
than skimming a thread on whatwg or webapps-public that people are already
on.

Every time I see &quot;we've started a new CG, everyone subscribe to our list!&quot;,
I cringe; the result here was predictable (
