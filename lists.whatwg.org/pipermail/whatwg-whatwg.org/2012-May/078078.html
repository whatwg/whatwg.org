&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also note that there is a great difference in implementation complexity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between various properties above. For example, viewport width/height is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather easy to work with because one can assume it won't change between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefetching and layout, so one can prefetch the right asset. On the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hand switching based on containing element width/height requires layout to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen before the right asset can be selected, so it has to be loaded late.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This will significantly decrease the perceived responsiveness of the site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Other properties like connection speed are very difficult to work with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because they can have high temporal variability e.g. due to sharing of one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection by many consumers, due to temporary environmental conditions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (train goes into a tunnel) or due to switching transports (wifi to 3G, for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example). My suspicion is that trying to write a solution for switching
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; based on connection speed would lead to people getting the &quot;wrong&quot; assets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much of the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if someone's connection speed changes dramatically when the image
</I>&gt;<i> request has already started, they'll either get:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - a high res image, but slowly
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - a low res image (relative to what their device can display)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not an expert on internet connections. I'd like to know,
</I>&gt;<i> statistically, how likely it is that a user's connection speed will
</I>&gt;<i> stay consistent (say +/- 20%) for a ten second period. Does anyone
</I>&gt;<i> know of any research like this? If wireless internet connections were
</I>&gt;<i> constantly all over the place it would be a concern, but as someone
</I>&gt;<i> that uses them all the time it doesn't feel that way to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do appreciate that standardised connection speed testing is going to
</I>&gt;<i> be hard. But if and when it comes, it should surely come in the form
</I>&gt;<i> of a media query (as well as a JS API) in which case &lt;picture&gt; would
</I>&gt;<i> support it automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that these concerns argue, to a certian extent, *against* reusing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very general syntax that can express constraints that aren't relevant to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actual use cases, or that provide an attractive nuisance that encourages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers to do things that can't be implemented in a performant way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dumping &lt;picture&gt; as it is won't prevent this, as it's already in the
</I>&gt;<i> door in the form of &lt;video&gt;.
</I>
This may not be as much of a problem as it seems though. A browser could
quite easily keep track of the connection speed over time and determine
a logical average. It could take into account things like the type of
network connection (e.g. a laptop may switch between wireless, tethered
phone or wired, and may move about between various networks of differing
speeds).

This may even be available at the OS level (I believe a Mac allows for
various network configurations based on the network it's attached to)
which would allow for a better experience for anyone using multiple
browsers often.

Thanks,
Ash
