<PRE>I didn&#8217;t want to cloud my previous email with my opinions on various solutions, but as you may expect, I have some thoughts on the solutions to these two use cases.

</I>
A solution to this use case should put 100% of the control in the hands of authors. It should provide the same control over images in html that is granted to authors over css images by media queries.

&gt;<i> Use case #2
</I>&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;<i> For a variety of reasons, images of various pixel density are needed. These reasons include current network connection speed, display pixel density, user data plan, and user preferences.
</I>
A solution to this use case should allow an author to supply a list of images at different densities (or better yet an image in a format that supports multiple densities), BUT the user agent should decide which image density is right for the situation.

Ideally, the user agent would make a decision about the appropriate image based on:

* Connection speed
* Display density
* Data plan
* User preference

Obviously not all of these can be supported currently and the list isn&#8217;t necessarily comprehensive. The point I&#8217;m making is that there are multiple factors to picking the right density. The user agent is in the best position to make these decisions.
