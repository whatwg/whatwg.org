<PRE>Thanks for the feedback. Please also forgive me not being too
technically aware of things at a browser level; so I'm not really sure
how valid my feedback can be:

The URI thing is actually using URI Templates, which are already
pretty far along? <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/uri-templates/">http://code.google.com/p/uri-templates/</A> I thought
this was a strong advantage of the idea.

Putting the variables into the CSS would break the advantage of them
being available to the browser *before* the browser starts trying to
pre-fetch images, right? Any solution has to avoid the prefetch
behaviour or else it fails; so I don't understand how they could be
moved.

I am of the opinion that media queries actually belong in the head
more often than they do elsewhere, both from a practical and semantic
standpoint (see
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2012/05/13/an-alternative-proposition-to-and-srcset-with-wider-scope/#comment-752">http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2012/05/13/an-alternative-proposition-to-and-srcset-with-wider-scope/#comment-752</A>
)

I had presumed that should multiple cases match the browser would
simply uses the last matching one. There's already a polyfil in JS
that does exactly that: <A HREF="http://jsbin.com/3/ecifaf/latest/">http://jsbin.com/3/ecifaf/latest/</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like the general idea and from an author perspective this seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great; but I know nothing of the browser/vendor side of the equation -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is this do-able?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Several critiques, in more or less random order:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure why it's billed as an alternative to @srcset as well - it
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to do with that functionality. &#160;It's purely a way to stuff
</I>&gt;<i> your media queries (which, as already established, can't be used to
</I>&gt;<i> serve different resolutions well) into a variable, and then abstract
</I>&gt;<i> your url-rewriting into a single place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do like the idea of abstracting your MQs - the post makes a good
</I>&gt;<i> point that between CSS and JS you're already duplicating your
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints, and if &lt;picture&gt; or a similar solution is adopted, you'll
</I>&gt;<i> be doing it a lot more. &#160;Unfortunately, Media Queries aren't
</I>&gt;<i> immediately amenable to CSS Variables (moving from global vars to
</I>&gt;<i> tree-scoped vars means that things that aren't part of the element
</I>&gt;<i> tree can no longer see the vars), so we either need something like
</I>&gt;<i> this, or I need to add to Variables so that they're friendly to this
</I>&gt;<i> use-case (and can interact with the URL-rewriting mechanism proposed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I share Anne's concern that the contents of &lt;head&gt; are often not
</I>&gt;<i> trivially authorable. &#160;This isn't killer, but it's something to keep
</I>&gt;<i> in mind. &#160;Moving the definition to CSS might help here, as it could be
</I>&gt;<i> put in an inline CSS block at the top of &lt;body&gt; then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This approach implies that all of your images (at least, all of them
</I>&gt;<i> with [case] in their URL) must respond to *all* of your breakpoints.
</I>&gt;<i> If an image doesn't change between certain breakpoints, it still needs
</I>&gt;<i> to exist in two places on your server (or you need to manually alias a
</I>&gt;<i> single file) and the browser will make an extra useless request if you
</I>&gt;<i> cross those breakpoints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From a technical purity standpoint, this introduces a new
</I>&gt;<i> URL-rewriting mechanism, but specialized for only a single purpose. &#160;I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect there are other uses that URL-rewriting could potentially be
</I>&gt;<i> put to; we should think about this and make sure that this approach
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't close the door to future uses. &#160;(It doesn't need to be
</I>&gt;<i> magically infinitely extensible - that way lies madness - but making
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably sure that it doesn't close the door to other URL-rewriting
</I>&gt;<i> use-cases is just good sense.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mentioned above that this solution has nothing to do with @srcset.
</I>&gt;<i> It's actually slightly worse - this ends up being *hostile* to
</I>&gt;<i> @srcset, such that you can't combine the two. &#160;At least, not without
</I>&gt;<i> reworking @srcset into a parallel URL-rewriter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal doesn't explain what to do when multiple MQs match.
</I>&gt;<i> Normally, the CSS cascade takes care of this - if you apply the same
</I>&gt;<i> property under multiple MQs that all match, specificity determines the
</I>&gt;<i> winner. &#160;It wouldn't be difficult to define how this worked -
</I>&gt;<i> last-wins is probably the sanest - but still, it's a detail to be
</I>&gt;<i> specified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, though, that if we want this to hook into a more generic
</I>&gt;<i> variables-in-MQ sort of thing, one may indeed want multiple axises of
</I>&gt;<i> variables that can match together. &#160;I suspect this is especially
</I>&gt;<i> useful with the new media queries that will show up in MQ4 to help
</I>&gt;<i> target different kinds of devices. &#160;So, it may be good to look into
</I>&gt;<i> widening this to accomodate different variable names, where within a
</I>&gt;<i> variable only a single case can &quot;win&quot; at a time. &#160;Related - it would
</I>&gt;<i> probably be good to be able to define a &quot;default&quot; case to fall back to
</I>&gt;<i> when none of the others match.
</I>&gt;<i>
