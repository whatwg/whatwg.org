You're right that changing your breakpoints requires changing all the
@srcset declarations.  An unfortunate aspect of our inability to
abstract away some of the functionality without breaking some of the
features (like being preloader-friendly).

However, something similar to your idea certainly seems possible to
use in an extention of the syntax.  Rather than specifying a w/h
component, give a 'case' component that refers to a breakpoint defined
elsewhere.  This could even potentially extend into url-templating.

This seems like a good bit of complexity for now, though.  I'd prefer
to iterate on the current proposal, keeping this kind of thing in
mind.  In particular, adding something like url-templating would
*massively* blow up the complexity of the feature, and delay its
implementation.
