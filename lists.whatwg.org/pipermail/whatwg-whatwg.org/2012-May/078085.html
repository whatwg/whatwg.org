We&#8217;re speaking in theoreticals here, which is what makes it hard for me to wrap my head around it being anyone&#8217;s major gripe with either proposal. Maybe a bandwidth media query isn&#8217;t the solution? Maybe, when the time comes, we do rely on the UA to make that decision. Maybe there&#8217;s a user preference that could be set. This line of reasoning doesn&#8217;t speak for or against either approach, however.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AND they have to update their sites and mediaqueries when we get
</I>&gt;<i> something new to optimize for. I don't think they will do that, based on
</I>&gt;<i> how extremely big the problem with -webkit-prefixes are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen enough of the web to be sceptical.
</I>
The amount of &#8220;developers can never be trusted with this&#8221; sentiment I&#8217;ve heard from the members of this group is incredibly depressing.

When we get &#8220;something new to optimize for,&#8221; we start adding that thing going forward. The evolution of media queries&#8212;or, say, HTML5&#8212;hasn&#8217;t led to a need to constantly revisit every piece of client work a developer has ever produced. We&#8217;re speaking in terms of optimization because that&#8217;s what it is: incremental improvements to the way assets are loaded. As more become available, requests become more tailored.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What if a the author doesn't write that min-connection-speed query
</I>&gt;<i> there? And who is the author of a page to decide such things anyway?
</I>&gt;<i> What about latency?  Should there be a max-latency: 10ms, there as well?
</I>&gt;<i> What about cost? I have a fast line, but it costs money to download
</I>&gt;<i> stuff, so I'd like the smaller pictures. What about if I have slow
</I>&gt;<i> internet connection, but I'd want to print the page, thus getting the
</I>&gt;<i> best version of the image? Or if I'm sitting with my new fancy hires KDE
</I>&gt;<i> Tablet and loading your page in a background-tab, letting it render and
</I>&gt;<i> be finished while I continue to read the page I'm on (the browser might
</I>&gt;<i> very well want to load the highres picture then, even though the
</I>&gt;<i> connection is slow, but with MQ, not that lucky).
</I>
I think this has has forked well into &#8220;should we have bandwidth available in a media query&#8221; territory. It&#8217;s a worthwhile topic for sure, but apart from being a minor and&#8212;again&#8212;purely speculative factor in considering an adaptive images approach, it is another conversation.
