</I>Actually not that small.... if you have some form with files that you 
can either pick from &lt;input file&gt; or D&amp;D those files somewhere, now, 
while constructong FormData/XHR you have to get the form data and check 
for any other places, where some files could have been dropped. Making 
FileList writable would mean that you can add file to &lt;input file&gt; and 
FormData/XHR usage is not just only more simple (all you need is to 
listen to drop event and solve it), but also better form theoretical 
programming point of view (why on earch a method to send form to server 
should know about what another UI belong to that form, sure, you can 
create the FormData and then pass it to that generic function, but it 
would require that the functionality to process form must know about 
anything else on that page, etc.) This would allow better modularization 
(I can just append a box to D&amp;D files, programm this box to pass files 
to form and leave the original functionality as it is... etc.)
