Except when they can, e.g. by printing or moving the display to another 
screen.

Basically, in this case not sending the high-res image is optimizing a 
bit for one common use case while degrading the user experience in other 
use cases.  Maybe that's OK, but that requires a careful analysis of 
user behavior for the particular content involved.  And in particular, 
I'm not sure what I think of labeling content that aims to be usable by 
the user in the widest variety of circumstances as &quot;irresponsible&quot;. 
Past examples of us doing that sort of thing led to it being considered 
&quot;irresponsible&quot; to allow website layouts to scale above or below certain 
widths, amongst other current usability disasters.

&gt;&gt;<i> Note that these concerns argue, to a certian extent, *against* reusing a

</I>
&lt;video&gt; has quite different dynamic behavior from &lt;img&gt; and quite 
different author expectations (e.g. authors don't expect videos to be 
preloaded in their entirety, by default; there are other significant 
expectation differences too).
