<PRE>Ok, so really it's an efficiency of authoring problem; before I just
didn't get how it'd be any different to a viewport width from the
perspective of an author.

That said, when coupled with viewport responses... yeah, that could
get complicated to author. Essentially each bandwidth bracket would be
a multiplier for the number of cases you'd need to address.

Cheers again.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, bandwidth is often quite variable, particularly on the

</I>&gt;<i> means the instantaneous bandwidth (what MQ would be using) can easily

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The author is just not in a good situation to be able to make sound

</I>&gt;<i> information than a MQ can provide, and even if we provided it, the
</I>&gt;<i> logic necessary to use that information *right* is fairly subtle and
</I>&gt;<i> definitely not settled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is why providing facilities for the author to just *tell* the
</I>&gt;<i> browser about the relative filesizes of things, so it can make its own
</I>&gt;<i> decisions about which resource to download. &#160;This keeps the language
</I>&gt;<i> simpler, because we don't have to communicate as much information. &#160;It
</I>&gt;<i> also centralizes the &quot;what to do&quot; logic into a small number of places
</I>&gt;<i> (the browsers) where it has a better chance of being right, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than hoping that thousands or milions of authors all stumble on the
</I>&gt;<i> best solution together, and keep their pages updated as best-practices
</I>&gt;<i> change.
