Absolutely. And from what I read (and I admit not reading the entire
archive of messages, but still, prefer to say my piece anyway) the
main concern about picture was the potencial verbosity. Instead of
trying to solve this issue, it got discarded.


There are proposals to deal with the media-query only once to activate
a specific page-global profile. It could support both ways: via media
attribute in picture or source elements or via a detection made on the
head.

Anyway, I'll have to re-read the archive of past conversations to be
able to formulate a complete proposal. But those efforts anyone of us
might take need to be respectfully considered just as srcset has. And
not discarded straight away.
