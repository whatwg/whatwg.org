<PRE>&gt;<i> The solution I've seen proposed[1] only aliases media query content, and
</I>&gt;<i> works only on a per-page basis, so it doesn't allow automatic addition of a
</I>&gt;<i> new image size site-wide, since you have to insert new &lt;source&gt; into every
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;picture&gt; anyway.
</I>
That is not true. With that particular solution you would never alter
any mark-up inside the &lt;body&gt;, you would only ever need to alter the
&lt;meta&gt; variables in the &lt;head&gt; - which more often than not are in a
single server-side template for a website. That solution makes it
trivial to adjust, add, or subtract the breakpoints of a design, and
therefor images, site-wide under normal website conditions (i.e.,
you're using a CMS to output the website).

&gt;<i> To me it looks like about the same amount of work as inserting new pixel
</I>&gt;<i> size into every srcset.
</I>
Completely not the case.

&gt;<i> What solution do you have in mind that would let you add a 'tv' breakpoint
</I>&gt;<i> site-wide for all images that have been prepared for it, without need to
</I>&gt;<i> update code that embeds those images? And is that really saving much effort?
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't you have to revisit every page anyway to test the new layout?
</I>
That following link does it:
