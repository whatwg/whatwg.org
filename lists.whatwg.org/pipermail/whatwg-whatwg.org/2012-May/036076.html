<PRE>You have to understand that the &lt;picture&gt; idea was not the result of
idle thought. We went through a *lot* of thinking to reach that point,
and so it's not actually an attachement to that idea so much as *we
know* that idea inside out, what it does, what it doesn't, and why
it's like that. We had thought about it from a lot of angles, thrown
everything we could at it, and determined that &lt;picture&gt; was the most
robust, familiar, and flexible solution out of half a dozen
possibilities - each of which was under similar scrutiny.

Then along comes srcset - which has not been subject to the same
scrutiny by that group. So *of course* it's getting questioned hard,
and *of course* &lt;picture&gt; is being held as answering the needs best.

Until srcset has been properly discussed, inspected, picked apart, and
subjected to the same level of scrutiny as &lt;picture&gt; was, it's not the
trusted thing that &lt;picture&gt; is.

Make no mistake; this is not a pride or attachment thing, this is a
knowing the reasons thing. I personally don't think &lt;picture&gt; answers
things well enough, nor do I think srcset does. Not for general use
cases - but for specific one-off use cases, each has benefits.

Personally I'm coming around to a refined version of the srcset idea
rather than &lt;picture&gt; after some clear explanation. But, again, I only
see it being appropriate for one-off use cases - singular special-case
images within a page. I don't think anyone has yet come up with a good
enough general purpose solution that avoids contaminating the mark-up
with design-dependent properties which will all be invalid come a
re-design - that to me is not acceptable. The closest I've seen that
could possibly address that limitation is &lt;meta&gt; variables, but that
has it's own issues and does not answer the same use-cases as srcset
or &lt;picture&gt;.

</I>&gt;<i> WHATWG seemed pretty unaware of it.
