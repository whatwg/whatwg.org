<PRE>You should look into the previous discussions at
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/">http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/</A>

There's also a prototype using media queries at
<A HREF="https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill.">https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill.</A> I realize you specifically said
you think media queries don't solve all of the problems, but it seems worth
looking at.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When authors adapt their sites for high-resolution displays such as the
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone's Retina display, they often need to be able to use different
</I>&gt;<i> assets representing the same image. Doing this for content images in
</I>&gt;<i> HTML is currently much more of a pain than it is in CSS (and it can be a
</I>&gt;<i> pain in CSS). I think we can best address this problem for bitmap[1]
</I>&gt;<i> content image by the addition of a srcset=&quot;&quot; attribute to the existing
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The srcset=&quot;&quot; attribute takes as its argument a simplified variant of
</I>&gt;<i> the image-set() microsyntax[2]. It would look something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;foo-lores.jpg&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     srcset=&quot;foo-hires.jpg 2x, foo-superduperhires.jpg 6.5x&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     alt=&quot;decent alt text for foo.&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img srcset&gt; takes one or more comma separated image specifiers. An
</I>&gt;<i> image specifier consists of a URL to an image asset and an associated
</I>&gt;<i> scale factor, expressed as a number followed by the literal character
</I>&gt;<i> 'x'. (The value of &lt;img src&gt; is treated as if it had a 1x scale
</I>&gt;<i> specified, so you can avoid duplicate references to the base asset.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User Agents may make their asset selection before fetching any of the
</I>&gt;<i> assets, thus avoiding multiple asset loads &amp; the associated performance
</I>&gt;<i> problems in constrained bandwidth environments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intrinsic size of the &lt;img&gt; can be computed by dividing the
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsic size of the actual image asset chosen with that asset's
</I>&gt;<i> associated scale factor. Suppose that foo-lowres.jpg is 100x100 and
</I>&gt;<i> foo-highres.jpg is 200x200 in the above example. If the UA chooses
</I>&gt;<i> foo-lowres.jpg, it computes the intrisnic size as (100/1)x(100/1) =
</I>&gt;<i> 100x100. If the UA chooses foo-highres.jpg, it computes the intrisnic
</I>&gt;<i> size as (200/2)x(200/2) = 100x100.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A nice thing about this proposal is its backwards compatibility story.
</I>&gt;<i> Browsers which don't yet support &lt;img srcset&gt; will simply use the asset
</I>&gt;<i> referenced by &lt;img src&gt;. A polyfill could easily be written to check for
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img srcset&gt; &amp; swap out a different asset into &lt;img src&gt;, much like
</I>&gt;<i> existing libraries which check for data-fullsrc=&quot;&quot; or the like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why provide a scale factor and not a media query? Well, media queries
</I>&gt;<i> are claims about UA state, whereas here we're asserting something about
</I>&gt;<i> the relationship between the image assets. Also, User Agents should be
</I>&gt;<i> free to use whichever asset they deem best suited to their current
</I>&gt;<i> situation, taking into account not just &quot;media-queriable things&quot; like
</I>&gt;<i> device resolution but also any scaling applied to the &lt;img&gt; with CSS,
</I>&gt;<i> its width=&quot;&quot; and height=&quot;&quot; attributes, or even things like the current
</I>&gt;<i> page zoom level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there are other things like bandwidth availability, data plan
</I>&gt;<i> usage, etc. that web developers might want to take into account when
</I>&gt;<i> choosing which image assets to load. This is definitely something worth
</I>&gt;<i> exploring. In the future we could extend the asset descriptors to cover
</I>&gt;<i> such cases. Something like this, maybe:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;img srcset=&quot;foo-lowres.jpg 1x low-bandwidth,
</I>&gt;<i>              foo-highres.jpg 2x high-bandwidth&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm purposefully not making a proposal for how to describe bandwidth,
</I>&gt;<i> data plan usage, or such things here. Ultimately I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> addressing the multiple-resolution case needs to wait for a solution to
</I>&gt;<i> these other cases. We don't need to &quot;SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS!&quot; right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One downside to this proposal is that the srcset=&quot;&quot; attribute takes a
</I>&gt;<i> microsyntax, and as a rule we try to avoid novel microsyntaxes in
</I>&gt;<i> attribute values. I think this particular microsyntax is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward and shouldn't cause all that much confusion for authors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is preferable to adding a suite of attributes with complex
</I>&gt;<i> inter-relationships, such as in Anselm Hannemann's proposal from last
</I>&gt;<i> August[3]. In such a proposal, we would either need to have a pre-
</I>&gt;<i> approved list of image scales (like Anselm's xs, s, m, l, xl), which
</I>&gt;<i> over-constrains designers' ability to create, or we would be introducing
</I>&gt;<i> user data into attribute names which&#8212;with the one exception of the
</I>&gt;<i> data-*=&quot;&quot; attributes&#8212;is something I really don't think we should do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some have argued that we should &quot;just use conneg&quot; to serve the best
</I>&gt;<i> image. This isn't an acceptable solution for at least three reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The server doesn't have all of the relevant information needed to
</I>&gt;<i>  pick the best image, and sending that information with every image
</I>&gt;<i>  asset request is bandwidth-intensive and enables increased user
</I>&gt;<i>  fingerprinting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * HTML is used in a lot of contexts, such as in EPUB, in which there's
</I>&gt;<i>  no server to negotiate with in the first place.[4]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The UA should be able to &quot;swap out&quot; one asset for another
</I>&gt;<i>  transparently after the page has loaded. For instance, the UA might
</I>&gt;<i>  want to swap things out when the user zooms in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also think this approach is better than minting a new image element,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'll make that argument in another email.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 1. &quot;What responsive image problem? Just use SVG!&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I've proposed image-set() for CSS4 Images. Here's the relevant post
</I>&gt;<i>   to www-style:

</I>&gt;<i>   An implementation of image-set() has recently landed in WebKit.
