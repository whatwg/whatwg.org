I don't understand what you are trying to do here. Can you elaborate on 
your use case?

The problem is that many possible implementations of date controls don't 
really leave anywhere to put the placeholder text. That's why it's not 
supported. We don't want some browsers to show it and others to not show 
it, since that would lead to some browsers possibly missing important 
information.


&gt;<i> The ISO date format has the advantage over different local date formats

</I>&gt;<i> the best way of specifying the format within this attribute.
</I>
Currently we're leaving this up to the user agent. Going forward, I expect 
that we'll address this using a combination of CSS and the ongoing Web 
Components work.

Neither zip codes nor credit card numbers are &quot;numbers&quot; in the sense of 
type=number. They're strings that happen to use numbers (and punctuation).

Indeed. In those cases you can just use hidden inputs.

</I>
Actually no, the main reason for &lt;output&gt; is to enable simpler 
manipulation in form control event handlers. It's not about semantics.

Compare the code in the &quot;simple calculator&quot; example in the spec:

   o.value = a.valueAsNumber + b.valueAsNumber

...to its equivalent before &lt;output&gt;:

   document.getElementById('o').textContent = a.valueAsNumber + b.valueAsNumber

We could have used &lt;span&gt;, if adding &lt;span&gt; to form.elements wasn't so 
likely to cause compat problems. (We added valueAsNumber for similar 
reasons; without that API, this example would be even more verbose.)

It's not really that burdensome. To assign a value to a hidden input as 
well as an output element is as easy as this (going back to the example 
above, and assuming a hidden input named &quot;h&quot;):

   h.value = o.value = a.valueAsNumber + b.valueAsNumber

The argument for &lt;input&gt; is &quot;it lets the browser know what interface to 
give the user to let the user change the value&quot;. There is no interface for 
changing the value for &lt;output&gt;. So the same argument does not apply.


&gt;<i> My take on it is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &lt;input&gt; not only allows a user to enter a value, it also displays 
</I>&gt;<i> its value to the user. For improved usability, some UAs will format or 
</I>&gt;<i> replace the value of an &lt;input&gt; element rather than displaying the raw 
</I>&gt;<i> string (some obvious candidates for this are: file, month, tel, date, 
</I>&gt;<i> number, and colour). For consistency, these UAs should also display 
</I>&gt;<i> calculated values - the values of &lt;output&gt; elements - in the same way. 
</I>&gt;<i> To do this, the element needs its type declared.
</I>
For both input and output, control over how the value is rendered (as 
opposed to what the editing UI should be) is something that it is expected 
will be handled by CSS and/or the Web Components work.
