</I>I also made the same mistake, and it took combing through all of
yesterday's and this morning's discussions on the topic for me to finally
understand it properly. And I consider myself to be a fairly competent
developer, not someone just starting out with HTML.

Now that I do understand I'm honestly happier with @srcset as a concept,
but my problems with the syntax itself still remain. In fact, they might be
amplified. Surely we can refine this into a better, more easily understood
syntax.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can see now how it does handle the art-direction case as well. I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's a shame that it's a different syntax to media queries but on the plus
</I>&gt;<i> side, if it maps directly to imgset in CSS, that's good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that Media Queries are appropriate for the
</I>&gt;<i> art-direction case and factors of the pixel dimensions of the image
</I>&gt;<i> referred to by src=&quot;&quot; are appropriate for the pixel density case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to solve these two axes in the
</I>&gt;<i> same syntax or solution. It seems to me that srcset=&quot;&quot; is bad for the
</I>&gt;<i> art-direction case and &lt;picture&gt; is bad for the pixel density case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I think the concept of dpi isn't appropriate for either case, FWIW. I
</I>&gt;<i> think &quot;the number of horizontal and vertical bitmap samples doubled
</I>&gt;<i> relative to the traditional src image&quot; works much better conceptually
</I>&gt;<i> for Web authoring than making people do dpi math with an abstract
</I>&gt;<i> baseline of 96 dpi. Anecdotal observation of trying to get family
</I>&gt;<i> members to do dpi math for print publications suggests that it's hard
</I>&gt;<i> to get educated people do dpi math right even when an &quot;inch&quot; is a real
</I>&gt;<i> inch an not an abstraction.)
