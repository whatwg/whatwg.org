<PRE>You might remember about my proposal 9 months ago. If not you can see it here: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/1158855">https://gist.github.com/1158855</A>

This is between the @srclist and the picture-element. It has MQ (which are optional imo, of course the browser should have a standard &quot;MQ&quot; (how ever this can look like and might feature bandwidth also)) and a sourcelist. And it features a html-common usage while being shorthand.
I also believe that if the developers should ever be provided with a bandwidth API this could be handled via media-queries.

The first example shows that a developer wants to specifically target specific screen sizes with a MQ while in the second it is up to the browser which one is used.
At least the normal src=&quot;&quot; is thought as fallback behavior for older browsers.

&gt;&gt;<i> Doing the same as whatever &lt;img&gt; ends up doing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be a good fit if the use cases are similar enough. Would be nice to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistent if that makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not 100% sure I grok the difference between media queries and
</I>&gt;<i> @srcset. I threw this question into the mix to see the reaction -
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we need both? What would that even mean?
</I>
I don't know if we need both. Why should we? Because @media-query features are currently not enough? Standard behavior which is build in a browser won't need any of these solutions, right? Also the picture-element does not *require* a MQ. It can also be used to just serve a list of sources and let it up to the browser what to fetch.

&gt;<i> In addition, I wonder about the adaptive streaming case where byte
</I>&gt;<i> ranges from different files are being switched to dynamically during
</I>&gt;<i> playback because of bandwidth change. For video, the solution seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be: use a manifest file in your @src (such as DASH) and rely on the
</I>&gt;<i> browser to pick between the files. Or you use javascript:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/media-source/media-source.html">http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/media-source/media-source.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> . An attribute like @srcset would allow listing the alternative files
</I>&gt;<i> directly in the HTML file. That may be preferable?
</I>
This sounds good but too complicated for a normal developer and you have to see that we also should respect CMS implementations.
I don't know (but probably only don't understand the technique correct) if this is not too complicated?

&gt;<i> More questions than answers right now, but we should think
</I>&gt;<i> consistently between audio, video and images.
</I>
That is what I totally support except there are already adaptive streaming technologies for video-formats but not for pictures (which is another topic I came up against a brick-wall).
