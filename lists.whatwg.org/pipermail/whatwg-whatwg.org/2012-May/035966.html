</I>
I must admit, I am still confused about the pre-loader issue. I'm not
sure whether the plan is that we'd be able to convince vendors to
disable it on &lt;img/&gt; elements containing srcset (or whatever solution
ends up final) or whether this is something that has to be worked with
now (in which case the &lt;meta&gt; variable idea seems to me the only one
that could work).

&gt;<i> However, something similar to your idea certainly seems possible to
</I>&gt;<i> use in an extention of the syntax. &#160;Rather than specifying a w/h
</I>&gt;<i> component, give a 'case' component that refers to a breakpoint defined
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere. &#160;This could even potentially extend into url-templating.
</I>
That's the conclusion that was come to at the RICG too, and why
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2012/05/13/an-alternative-proposition-to-and-srcset-with-wider-scope/">http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/2012/05/13/an-alternative-proposition-to-and-srcset-with-wider-scope/</A>
was put forward. I haven't received promising feedback from the WHATWG
about it though :s

&gt;<i> This seems like a good bit of complexity for now, though. &#160;I'd prefer
</I>&gt;<i> to iterate on the current proposal, keeping this kind of thing in
</I>&gt;<i> mind. &#160;In particular, adding something like url-templating would
</I>&gt;<i> *massively* blow up the complexity of the feature, and delay its
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>
I'm happy with that too, any progress is good progress and it doesn't
all have to come at once. That said I won't use any solution until it
has this level of abstraction: that's a criticism I brought up with
&lt;picture&gt; too (and why I wouldn't use that either in it's current RICG
form).
