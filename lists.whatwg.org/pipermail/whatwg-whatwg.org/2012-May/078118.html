I don't know of this having any traction within actual browsers.  It
might be a good idea, I dunno.

That's why I mentioned an inline &lt;style&gt; at the top of the &lt;body&gt; -
I'm not sure if browsers skip past that when building the tree or not,
but it's *potentially* available.

&gt;<i> I am of the opinion that media queries actually belong in the head

I don't necessarily disagree.  I wasn't arguing from a theoretical
standpoint, just supporting Anne's point that, from a practical
standpoint, putting things into &lt;head&gt; isn't always easy for authors.

&gt;<i> I had presumed that should multiple cases match the browser would

</I>&gt;<i> that does exactly that: <A HREF="http://jsbin.com/3/ecifaf/latest/">http://jsbin.com/3/ecifaf/latest/</A>
</I>
Yeah, you can't assume that.  They're conditions, and a page can
potentially match multiple of them at once.  For example, if your MQs
are &quot;min-width: 1000px&quot; and &quot;min-width: 300px&quot;, a 1200px wide screen
will match both of them.  You can *make* them exclusive by adding a
max-width declaration as well, but we can't depend on that happening,
so the behavior has to be specified somewhere.

Similarly, we can't depend on *any* of them matching, so there should
be a default case that is used when nothing else matches.
