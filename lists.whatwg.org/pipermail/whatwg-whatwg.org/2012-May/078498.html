It's just as dense as the original srcset proposal if you don't need
media queries:
&lt;img src=&quot;normal.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;high.jpg 2x&quot;&gt;

I my mind, you only pull out the rest if you actually need media queries.

</I>
It might be confusing, but there is logic in the splitting:

srcset=&quot;.....&quot; lets you describe the properties of a set of
equivalent images, and the browser decides which
one is more appropriate given the environment.

&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media=&quot;...&quot; lets you decide which image
should be displayed based on the properties of the medium
you're displaying on.


&gt;<i> * It bakes design properties into the mark-up. They will be the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints come any re-design.
</I>
It does, and I am somewhat reluctant because of that. But arguably,
&lt;img&gt; already has that problem, even if it is to a lesser degree, and to
be purely semantic, the mark-up ought to only contain the alt text, to
be replaced (or not, if you're on a voice browser) by the approriate
image using the css content property. But &lt;img&gt; is practical enough
that you don't want be bothered with that, and I am thinking that
media queries enabled images (aka &lt;picture&gt;) would be valuable
for the same reason.
