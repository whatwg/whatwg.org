What _makes_ these attributes &quot;just hints&quot; _is_ that you can have user 
preferences that override the defaults.

I think it's imperative that users be able to disable all video playback. 
By definition, that means that not all videos are going to play. This 
means that &quot;autoplay&quot; can't be relied upon to work.

I don't think that's a problem. There's plenty of examples of things like 
that in the spec. For example, several browsers don't render images at 
all except when requested to render them, and then only in a separate 
window, not inline. I would expect similar behaviour for video.

The great thing about HTML is specifically that it is media-independent in 
this very manner, allowing different user agents to be agents of the user, 
not of the author, displaying the content in the manner most appropriate 
for the user.

I do not think that example is realistic, as discussed in the bug.

</I>
There might not _be_ an internal preload state. I don't know how we can 
really specify this.

I'm happy to add a note if that would help avoid bugs; let me know if you 
think that would help (ideally, also let me know what you think the note 
should say).

Images aren't required to load at all. Scripts aren't required to run at 
all. The window size is allowed to be any dimension at all. CSS isn't 
required to be supported at all. Users are allowed to apply arbitrary 
user style sheets. Users are allowed to interact with form controls by 
using the keyboard or the mouse or any other input device.

All of these do break some pages.
