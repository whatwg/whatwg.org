There's very good article about the two cases:

<A HREF="http://blog.cloudfour.com/a-framework-for-discussing-responsive-images-solutions/">http://blog.cloudfour.com/a-framework-for-discussing-responsive-images-solutions/</A>

srcset is not very good for &quot;art-directed&quot; case, while &lt;picture&gt; is  
perfect for it.

&lt;picture&gt; is not very good for resolution/bandwidth optimisation, while  
srcset is perfect for it.


I think those are simply two different problems that just happen to be  
called &quot;adaptive images&quot;. We should recognized that they're separate and  
design separate solutions for them. A single solution can't do both well,  
since there's a fundamental difference between author-controlled and  
UA-controlled decision.
