<PRE>That's one of the major advantages of Adaptive Images (the PHP/JS
solution) and what people most like about it when they give me
feedback - it's all automatic with no custom HTML and it does all
image generation itself.

Yes, the vast majority of people who are going to put images into
websites are not web-developers but people using some CMS. The only
way these people are going to get multiple versions of the same image
is if the CMS can do it either automatically through re-sizing (as AI
does) or through providing upload fields for each breakpoint size.

The problem for end users (CMS users) is one of asset creation -
that's not a problem which can be solved by us in the scope of this
work - but we *do* need to consider this with whatever we end up
implementing. It is *highly* likely that the majority of use cases any
adaptive HTML mechanism will be applied to will have assets reference
through some automated image creation facility - as opposed to
hand-created.

That's why setting path variables is good. It's very likely that any
CMS is going to dump images into folders based on their fitting into a
design breakpoint: exactly as Adaptive Images does now. The number of
uses where people will manually create images at all sizes to
non-predictable paths are competitively tiny.

One-off responsiveness (one image element on a page, which is unique
in terms of adaption points) is where &lt;picture&gt; may be useful. For
general responsiveness, the meta variable method is much more
appropriate and efficient.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;meta name=&quot;case&quot; value=&quot;large&quot; media=&quot;min-width:900px;&quot; /&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> (min-width:30em)&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> for example. MQ are by far the most flexible way of dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> reacting to device constraints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is set is the path to look for the image. This is *exactly* how
</I>&gt;<i> this works in CSS already for background-images and all authors are
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with this - you don't set the pixel density of an image, you
</I>&gt;<i> detect the device pixel density and change the path of the image you
</I>&gt;<i> send over CSS. Have a look at how almost any site is built and you'll
</I>&gt;<i> see *paths* change, not *image names*. <A HREF="http://enochs.co.uk">http://enochs.co.uk</A> is one
</I>&gt;<i> example.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Requiring access to head is not much of an issue, and has not been
</I>&gt;<i> raised by anyone commenting on the CG thread. Web designs tend to be
</I>&gt;<i> 3-7 breakpoints that are shared site-wide. The actual design of each
</I>&gt;<i> page may not be, but the breakpoints are. This is why site's with many
</I>&gt;<i> types of page can all share the same list of CSS assets to load:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!-- Styling for all devices --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; href=&quot;/assets/css/screen.core.css&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!-- Styling for progressively larger displays --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;only screen and (min-width: 320px)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;/assets/css/screen.320.css&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;only screen and (min-width: 480px)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;/assets/css/screen.480.css&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;only screen and (min-width: 750px)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;/assets/css/screen.750.css&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;only screen and (min-width: 960px)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;/assets/css/screen.960.css&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are proposing nothing different than that, but to set variables
</I>&gt;<i> rather than to load a particular CSS file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it works for authors using CSS, why should it not also work for
</I>&gt;<i> setting image paths?
