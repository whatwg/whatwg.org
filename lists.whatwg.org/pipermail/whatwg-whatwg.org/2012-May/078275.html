<PRE>Non announcement _here_ is one thing, sure; but as those aiming to plan, test and measure different approaches, it's your role to research other developments out side of the WHATWG bubble. 

WHATWG does not exist to be a closed society.

</I>&gt;<i> I didn't know about the respimg CG until a few days ago (after a couple of days of discussion of responsive image proposals, and months after Ted first posted his image-set proposal to www-style). Checking after the fact, I could find no mention of the term &quot;respimg&quot; or anything else uniquely identifying the community group in the archives of <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">whatwg at whatwg.org</A> or public-html, and no one from the CG that I asked had a recollection of announcing it here. That's the basis for my assumption that most people here didn't know about the CG while it was working on its proposal. Do you have a basis for assuming otherwise?
