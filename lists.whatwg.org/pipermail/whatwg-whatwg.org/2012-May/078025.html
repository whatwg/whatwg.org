</I>
We should indeed fix it.

&gt;<i> CSS3 Images has the image-resolution property, which lets you tell the
</I>&gt;<i> browser what resolution to display the image at (that is, how it
</I>&gt;<i> should determine the automatic size).  You can say &quot;image-resolution:
</I>&gt;<i> from-image;&quot; to get it to use the image's native resolution, whatever
</I>&gt;<i> it is.  So, we need to add a rule to the UA stylesheet that says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;img[srcset] { image-resolution: from-image; }&quot;.
</I>
Do we want from-image here? Or do authors prefer to serve 96dpi images  
that are bigger, and specify the intended dpi in the markup?

&gt;<i> In the closely-related case of using image-set() in CSS, we can just
</I>&gt;<i> have the &quot;winning image&quot; set the default resolution.  An earlier
</I>&gt;<i> version of the image() function let you set an image's resolution
</I>&gt;<i> immediately, but we punted it for simplicity at level 3.  This would
</I>&gt;<i> do the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That all said, I don't like the &quot;2x&quot; notation.  It's declaring &quot;this
</I>&gt;<i> image's resolution is twice that of a normal image&quot;.  This has two
</I>&gt;<i> problems.  For one, we already have a unit that means that - the dppx
</I>&gt;<i> unit.  Using &quot;2dppx&quot; is identical to the meaning of &quot;2x&quot;.  Since
</I>&gt;<i> image-set() is newer than the dppx unit, we should change it to use
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;resolution&gt; instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For two, I'm not sure that it's particularly obvious that when you say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2x&quot;, you should make sure your image was saved as 196dpi.  You have
</I>&gt;<i> to already know what the default resolution is.  As well, I think that
</I>&gt;<i> values like 300dpi are pretty common, and they don't map to integral
</I>&gt;<i> 'x' values.  If people say &quot;screw it&quot; and use &quot;3x&quot;, this'll be
</I>&gt;<i> slightly wrong and I think will cause ugly blurring.  If we make this
</I>&gt;<i> take &lt;resolution&gt;, people can just use the dpi unit.
</I>
Can we just use CSS's 'dpi' instead?

&lt;img src=&quot;default.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;highres.jpg 300dpi&quot;&gt;

&gt;<i> I agree overall that this is the right approach - declaring relevant
</I>&gt;<i> information to the browser and letting it decide what to do is better
</I>&gt;<i> than trying to set up constraints by yourself.  For example, using MQ
</I>&gt;<i> could result in the silly situation of downloading a high-res image at
</I>&gt;<i> first because you're on 4G, then throwing them away and downloading
</I>&gt;<i> low-res images when you drop to 2G.  Using image-set() or @srcset
</I>&gt;<i> would let the browser keep the images it had already downloaded.
</I>
Indeed.
