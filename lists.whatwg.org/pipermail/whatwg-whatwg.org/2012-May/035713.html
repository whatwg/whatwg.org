Can you elaborate on precisely what it is you mean? I couldn't find 
anything where this was left undefined. For example, the &lt;script&gt; 
processing algorithms seem unambiguous on this point (the contents get 
ignored), as do the parsing rules. The conformance requirements seem to 
cover that case too.


&gt;<i> Per section 4.3.1.3 [1] we just know that 'If a |script| element's |src| 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute is specified, then the contents of the |script| element, if 
</I>&gt;<i> any, must correspond to putting the contents of the element in 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript comments'. I think that such content would be ignored: since 
</I>&gt;<i> it has a src tag, it would be marked as 'from an external file' and 'The 
</I>&gt;<i> contents of that file are the script source', but it could also be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered to be external and inline at the same time.
</I>
The contents are ignored in this case, yes. The spec says &quot;For the 
purposes of these steps, the script is considered to be from an external 
file if, while the prepare a script algorithm above was running for this 
script, the script element had a src attribute specified&quot;.


&gt;<i> I realised this when looking at the recommended code for embedding 
</I>&gt;<i> Google+ [2] (choose a language other than US English). It looks like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;<A HREF="https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js">https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js</A>&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   {lang: 'en-GB'}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The script [3] is too minified to follow, but it looks they are using 
</I>&gt;<i> the same tag for including the script and embedding parameters, even 
</I>&gt;<i> though they are disobeying a must by doing so. Maybe they have a string

</I>&gt;<i> clarification in the specification looks good.
</I>
What Google are doing here is non-conforming (precisely because it is so 
confusing -- it looks like it's an inline script, but isn't).

As soon as the element is inserted, it begins loading. So you know whether 
it's loading by whether or not you've inserted it. Once it's loaded, it 
will run as soon as it can modulo the loading constraints (like defer, 
etc), at which point beforescriptexecute fires. After it's run, the 
afterscriptexecute and load events fire.


&gt;<i> In regards to all the concern about double-firing of load detection

Script loader libraries are not the only consumer here.

That's pretty much the strongest argument one can make. :-)

Mostly on the strength of Bjorn's comments, I haven't changed anything 
here. It's not clear to me how not firing window.onerror would really help 
in this situation.

It's not the fact that there's an error that we're hiding by obfuscating 
window.onerror in cross-origin scripting cases, it's information about the 
file's contents that wouldn't otherwise be obtainable (like line numbers) 
that we're trying to hide.

Note that this would likely happen anyway even if the script load is

My preference would be 1 then 4 then 3 then 2.

Why is XMLHttpRequest with CORS complicated here? It seems like it'd be as 
easy as JSONP -- it's only one header, right?

That would certainly be interesting. I'm not really sure how to approach 
it though.

That seems fine to me, but I'll leave that up to Anne to pick up if he 
wants to spec it. (I've left out other XHR feedback along these lines. I 
recommend discussing XHR on <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">public-webapps at w3.org.</A>)

We've taken this feature out due to compat issues.

Yes, of course. (Not sure it's worth supporting though.)
