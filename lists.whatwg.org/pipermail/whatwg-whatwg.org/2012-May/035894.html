I suspect this is simply confusion about the proposal - @srcset
handles the &quot;art-directed&quot; case same as &lt;picture&gt;, just with a
somewhat more compact microsyntax rather than using MQs directly.  (On
the plus side, the slightly-special processing of the microsyntax
ensures that at least one image will be chosen no matter what, while
it's unclear how an MQ-based solution will work if none of the MQs
match.)

Given that @srcset was generated as a solution to the use-cases that
the CG brought up, it would be difficult to justify it if it didn't
handle those cases.  ^_^
