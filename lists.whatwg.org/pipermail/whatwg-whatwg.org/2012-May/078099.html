That wasn't my assumption.

For optimisation case expected images to vary only in compression strength  
or DPI (low-res JPEG or 2x image for Retina display), but never in their  
dimension in CSS pixels.


I think page should not be allowed to change layout based on bandwidth  
availability, because of browser caches. Imagine scenario:

1. User visits page on high-bandwidth connection and UA caches some high  
quality images.
2. Connection changes to slower one.
3. User visits the page again. HTML was non-cacheable, but images were  
cacheable.

Now the page may have mix of high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth content.  
It's entirely possible to have mixed quality with images if they have same  
CSS pixel size (and use of higher quality images whenever possible is  
desirable), but a page cannot contain mix of multiple different layouts at  
the same time.

If bandwidth was a media query, then entire page may have to be downgraded  
to low-bandwidth version even if UA had a lot of high-bandwidth content  
cached.

&gt;&gt;<i> Adaptation of images to the layout is page-specific. Adaptation of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> images to bandwidth/screen is UA/device-specific.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite. But the latter just might affect the layout.
</I>
I think optimisation case should be forbidden from affecting the layout.

&gt;&gt;<i> Author is in the best position to adapt image to page layout. User-agent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is in the best position to determine speed/quality trade-offs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But low-res images usually don't look too good when upscaled. Thus few
</I>&gt;<i> pixels should mean small image, UAs mustn't default to pixelation.
</I>
I don't understand why UA would &quot;default to pixelation&quot;?

The whole point of declaring available image versions is giving UA  
possibility to default to whatever it deems best.

When user is on GPRS or roaming connection then pixelation is a great  
outcome compared to not being able to download images at all due to  
prohibitive size/price.

When user is on broadband connection then UA can select high resolution  
images and avoid pixelation when network/hardware allows it.

And when image properties are specified declaratively, a smart UA can even  
do a mix of both, e.g. download pixelated images on mobile connections and  
give user option to selectively download higher-res images, or download  
low-res first for fast initial display and then download high-res in the  
background.

&gt;&gt;<i> Media queries MUST be interpreted exactly as author specified them.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus we mustn't force UAs to pretend to render to small viewports to
</I>&gt;<i> find low-res images. That would have unwieldy side-effects.
</I>
Indeed!

&gt;&gt;<i> User-agents need freedom to choose image resolution based on open set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> factors, many of which are details authors should not have to think  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about (presence in cache, cost of bandwidth, available memory, external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displays, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the chosen image resolution might be a factor for choosing layout.
</I>
By resolution I mean pixel density (regular vs &quot;Retina&quot; display), so this  
doesn't affect layout.


I can imagine layout complexity being tied to bandwidth (an image-rich  
design vs minimalistic text-only design), but I'm not sure how that would  
work in practice given that cache has &quot;infinite&quot; bandwidth, and network  
speed can change any second on mobile connections.

It would be weird if page design changed when you moved between cell  
towers or left/entered a cafe that had public WiFi. And if bandwidth media  
query was defined to be fixed, then you'd sometimes end up stuck with  
wrong design that was chosen based on a temporary network state.

There is no such problem if only same-CSS-pixel-size images are swapped  
in-place.
