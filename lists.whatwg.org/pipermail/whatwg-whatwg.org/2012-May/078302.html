<PRE>As a UA &quot;implementor&quot;, this seem to me to be purely a success story
for the single reason that it drew so much developer participation.

Regardless of what makes it into the spec, the worst possible outcome
would be if the developer community learned the lesson that UA
implementors are hostile to/dismissive of their problems, ideas and
solutions.

It seems to me like there's a problem of &quot;walking a mile in someone
else's shoes&quot; in both directions, but ultimately developers are our
customers -- not vice versa.

If it's required for either &quot;camp&quot; to go the extra mile to accomodate
the other -- it seems to me that it ought to be us.
