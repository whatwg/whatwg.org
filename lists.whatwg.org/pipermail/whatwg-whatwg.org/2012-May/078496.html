</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Matt Wilcox's first two points are fair, though I see them as inconveniences rather than blockers.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To his third point, however:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see the suggestion mentioned on occasion that content image sizes and design breakpoints should be coordinated, but in practice, I personally haven't found much of a need for that coordination.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the responsive layouts I've worked on, content image sizes and their breakpoints were chosen for completely different reasons than the design (CSS) breakpoints: the former for sensible jumps in file size to match screen dimension and/or density, and the latter for how content modules are visibly designed at given viewport dimensions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Design breakpoints can be plentiful, especially when factoring in all the minor and major tweaks in multi-column responsive layout. Yet for content images, I've found the need for fewer breakpoints, or even entirely different breakpoints than the design. In a site like the bostonglobe.com for example, 2-3 image sizes provide sensible jumps in file size, and because the images live a fluid layout, they scale to fill the layout gaps as the CSS breakpoints shift much more frequently around them. &#160;If an image needs finer coordination than that with its design, perhaps it might be considered a design asset that should be handled in CSS with background images; I guess I'd need to see some examples of where this problem could occur.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are sure to be gray areas here. I'm just not sure I agree that the redesign problem is all that much of a real concern for this feature. Matt, if you disagree, do you have any examples you could provide?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure :) In many ways I agree with you - the entire &lt;img&gt; problem is
</I>&gt;<i> really all about *the space they fit into* and not about the design.
</I>&gt;<i> And if CSS and HTML could work with that then we would be in a far
</I>&gt;<i> better position because they'd be able to adapt to any space
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of what the design is. The problem is that CSS media
</I>&gt;<i> queries do not work with the space an image fits into - they can only
</I>&gt;<i> measure the viewport. Which means that in practice you're actually
</I>&gt;<i> coupled to the design breakpoint, even when you're intentionally
</I>&gt;<i> working with the containing element into which the image is sitting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e., the space into which the image can fit is defined in the design
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint. It can't be known any other way because we can't measure
</I>&gt;<i> the containing space itself - we have to define it as part of the
</I>&gt;<i> design based on the value of the viewport width.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does that make sense?
</I>
To illustrate the example:

I have my first design, and it is intended for 1600px wide viewports.
In this design I have a main column that's 1200px wide, and I've set
all my &lt;img&gt;'s to adapt to that breakpoint. When those &lt;img&gt;s see a
viewport in excess of 1600px they go and load the matching resource;
which is a 1600px wide image. All is dandy.

Two years later there's a re-design, and I've got hundreds of blog
posts with embedded &lt;img&gt; elements that match a 1600px wide viewport.
But the re-design isn't the same layout. It now has three columns at
that viewport width, not one main column. And now all of the &lt;img&gt;
elements match the viewport... but lead to images which are much too
large for the new design.

Or, even worse, the new design has completely different breakpoints,
and the &lt;img&gt;'s that are being loaded when the viewport hits 1600px
are completely at odds with the layout bracket that I'd defined for
1200-1800px ranges.

This is what I mean by saying that we're tying our &lt;img&gt; elements to
design breakpoints. Everything is based on Viewports, and we could
*really* do with them not being. That's incredibly unlikely to happen
though because the technologies just aren't designed that way. Which
means we have to hope for a second-best approach of some hefty
abstraction.
