FWIW I think that forming community groups that are limited in scope to 
gathering and distilling the relevant use cases could be a functional way 
of working. For example if, in this case, people had said &quot;we will form a 
group that will spend 4 weeks documenting and prioritising all the use 
cases that a responsive images feature needs to cover&quot; and then the 
results of that work had been taken to a forum where browser implementors 
are engaged (e.g. WHATWG), I think we would have had a relatively smooth 
ride toward a universially acceptable solution.

Of course there are disadvantages to this fragmentary approach compared to 
having one centralised venue, but it has the advantages too; notably 
people are more likely to subscribe to a low-traffic mailing list that 
just covers one feature they care about then subscribe to the WHATWG 
firehose. It also wouldn't require the unscalable solution of having 
vendors subscribe to one list per feature (fragmentation in this direction 
is already a huge problem at e.g. W3C and means that obvious problems with 
specs get missed until late in the game because people with the right 
expertise aren't subscribed to the correct lists).
