We have supported the media attribute since the first stable release with  
&lt;video&gt; (Opera 10.50) and Git blames me. However, I must say that I just  
added it because it was in the spec and don't remember any discussion  
about it. Some digging shows that it was added to the spec in  
&lt;<A HREF="http://html5.org/r/724">http://html5.org/r/724</A>&gt;, but I don't know why.

As far as I can tell, it's mostly useless and I've never heard of it  
actually being used. The correct way to handle different screen sizes and  
bandwidth constraints is adaptive streaming. Simon Pieters has suggested  
simply dropping the attribute and I would not object to that.
