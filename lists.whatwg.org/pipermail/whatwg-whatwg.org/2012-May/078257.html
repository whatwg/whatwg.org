I get that. I understand the delays and such involved. I'm just making
sure it's critically looked at.

At the end of the day, my CMS handles images internally, so I can just
update how the image template prints out the display and I'm good to
go on an update. I'm just trying to look at others who won't have it
as easy.

Consider WordPress Guy who has all of this code embedded, and has to
go back and update every post in order to change.

Consider Left Bar Girl who actually sets the same image on two
different break points (i.e. big image, small image, and then big
image again) because after she un-floats the left bar, the larger
image is the best fit again.

Perhaps that's a use case to put up on the wiki, the whole left bar deal.

Why not adopt a better standard that is forward looking to SPDY?
