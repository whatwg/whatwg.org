I looked into whether we should define a declarative solution for this, 
but I think that so far it seems that these autocomplete features are 
still very much evolving. For example, Google has been adding new things 
to their autocomplete regularly. In fact most autocomplete widgets seem to 
have some special feature that wouldn't easily fit into a generic 
declarative model -- consider Amazon's, where hovering over an item 
changes the department dropdown's selection without moving the 
autocomplete box, or Bing's, where typing &quot;weather&quot; inlines an interactive 
graphical weather box, or Apple's, where the items have an image and 
formatting.

Oh, I don't know. It's certainly plausible that this kind of thing will 
become commonplace enough and broadly similar enough that it makes sense 
to have a declarative way of specifying an autocomplete server, etc.

But currently, we're still very much in the early days of this stuff.

Agreed.

If opensearch's version of this was the widely used state of the art and 
people weren't still very much innovating in this space, I'd probably 
agree.

Note that even in this space, though, it's not the end of the story. For 
example, Chrome does more than just list the search autocomplete results; 
it also loads the first suggestion in the background, and mixes in results 
from local history search, etc. Other browsers do similar mixing. While 
this works well for browser UI, where the browser can mix in all the 
various results together, when you are talking about a Web page you still 
end up needing script to do that. So having it declarative isn't 
necessarily a win.
