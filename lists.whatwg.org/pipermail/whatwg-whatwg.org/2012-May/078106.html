For the record, developing a web browser and in the process realizing 
how much web content is fundamentally completely broken is incredibly 
depressing.

Hence the general attitude of the UA vendors in this group.

Now we may perhaps have a skewed perspective: sites that are 
well-designed and Just Work in all browsers all the time don't show up 
on browser vendors' radars, obviously.

But such sites are actually rather rare, in my experience.  Pretty much 
every single high-profile site I can think of has had completely broken 
code on it at various points; several do today.  Not only that, but a 
good fraction of the time when you point the brokenness out to the site 
maintainers they don't bother fixing it.

Non-high-profile sites tend to be even worse: they have less of a 
budget, and more broken things going on.  :(

And yes, it's all depressing as you said.
