The spec has a bug where it is contradicting itself in some steps. That
makes it very hard to read and confusing for those who read those steps.

&gt;&gt;<i> I can see now how it does handle the art-direction case as well. I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the plus side, if it maps directly to imgset in CSS, that's good.

</I>
Yes, the late load (or extra load). And the early load.

&gt;<i> I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to solve these two axes in the
</I>&gt;<i> same syntax or solution. It seems to me that srcset=&quot;&quot; is bad for the
</I>&gt;<i> art-direction case and &lt;picture&gt; is bad for the pixel density case.
</I>
Weeeell. Not too sure I agree with /all/ of that. I agree in general,
but I also think that the early load model should be allowed to fetch
based on viewport size straight away.

If I have to choose between &quot;loading image late, when mq etc engine has
started, being very flexible&quot; and &quot;loading image fast, not flexible at
all, just browser magic&quot; - I'd go for the second one.


Even though we want to serve small images to my mobile phone, I'd still
like for it to be as fast as the browser is able to handle.

But it is merely meant for different sizes of the same content image
then. Only doing pixel densities feels very limiting. A bit too limiting
to be useful for the non-art directed &quot;I just want it to go fast&quot;.
