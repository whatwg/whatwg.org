</I>&gt;<i> To his third point, however:

</I>&gt;<i> I see the suggestion mentioned on occasion that content image sizes and design breakpoints should be coordinated, but in practice, I personally haven't found much of a need for that coordination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the responsive layouts I've worked on, content image sizes and their breakpoints were chosen for completely different reasons than the design (CSS) breakpoints: the former for sensible jumps in file size to match screen dimension and/or density, and the latter for how content modules are visibly designed at given viewport dimensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Design breakpoints can be plentiful, especially when factoring in all the minor and major tweaks in multi-column responsive layout. Yet for content images, I've found the need for fewer breakpoints, or even entirely different breakpoints than the design. In a site like the bostonglobe.com for example, 2-3 image sizes provide sensible jumps in file size, and because the images live a fluid layout, they scale to fill the layout gaps as the CSS breakpoints shift much more frequently around them. &#160;If an image needs finer coordination than that with its design, perhaps it might be considered a design asset that should be handled in CSS with background images; I guess I'd need to see some examples of where this problem could occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are sure to be gray areas here. I'm just not sure I agree that the redesign problem is all that much of a real concern for this feature. Matt, if you disagree, do you have any examples you could provide?
</I>
Sure :) In many ways I agree with you - the entire &lt;img&gt; problem is
really all about *the space they fit into* and not about the design.
And if CSS and HTML could work with that then we would be in a far
better position because they'd be able to adapt to any space
regardless of what the design is. The problem is that CSS media
queries do not work with the space an image fits into - they can only
measure the viewport. Which means that in practice you're actually
coupled to the design breakpoint, even when you're intentionally
working with the containing element into which the image is sitting.

I.e., the space into which the image can fit is defined in the design
breakpoint. It can't be known any other way because we can't measure
the containing space itself - we have to define it as part of the
design based on the value of the viewport width.

Does that make sense?
