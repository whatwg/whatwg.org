OK, I am not sure what format to reply to emails with - some people
complain when quotes are left out entirely, other people complain when
replies are in-line in the style you request, other people complain
unless the whole thread is included verbatim in any reply. What's the
actual WHATWG proscribed format for conducting conversations in email
format?

Cool - so you're saying we have the option of being able to instruct
browsers *not* to perform prefetch in certain circumstances?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... But it doesn't work. Please read my emails, and come with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am unable to give technical feedback of the required level; I'm here
as an author to tell you this is how we build stuff and this is how
we'd want to use images - just like we do with CSS. Just as technical
problems won't go away, neither will authors use cases and
requirements :) And, unfortunately, I am not skilled enough with the
technical side to be able to give you answers to the problem. I'm just
stating that the problem is not one that can be ignored lightly
because it would mean that the proposed solution does not work with
how websites are being built today.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I did find a way forward for the model 2, make a way to defer the
</I>&gt;<i> image load and find a way to load it. Maybe &lt;picture&gt; element should
</I>&gt;<i> always defer? It actually *has to* because it uses media queries, so in
</I>&gt;<i> fact, &lt;picture&gt; might be a solution for model 2 in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But @srcset is solving the other part of the equation (model 1).

</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> Odin H&#248;rthe Omdal (Velmont/odinho) &#183; Core, Opera Software, <A HREF="http://opera.com">http://opera.com</A>
</I>
I'm not entirely convinced about this abstraction of model 1 and model
2. &lt;picture&gt; is flawed anyway, and srcset in the same manner, by
baking the response tests into the mark-up. When it comes time to
re-design there will be new breakpoints and they are not likely to
match the one's in the &lt;img&gt; / &lt;picture&gt; tags. It's the major hold-up
I had with &lt;picture&gt; and why I suggested looking into abstracting
breakpoint conditions away from the responding element and into the
&lt;head&gt;.
