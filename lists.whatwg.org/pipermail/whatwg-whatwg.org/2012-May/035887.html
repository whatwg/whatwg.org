</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah! What a truly great question, so simple.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The answer is: no, it is not media-queries although they look like it. A
</I>&gt;<i> big problem is that it's so easy to explain it by saying &quot;it's just like
</I>&gt;<i> media-query max-width&quot;, rather than finding the words to illustrate that
</I>&gt;<i> they are totally different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The *limited effect* also feels similar which doesn't help the case at
</I>&gt;<i> all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, even though I have a rather bad track record of explaining any
</I>&gt;<i> thing, I'll try again:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Media queries come from the client side. They allow the author of a web
</I>&gt;<i> page to tell exactly how she want to lay out her design based on the
</I>&gt;<i> different queries. The browser *HAS* to follow these queries. And also,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think (please correct me if wrong) the media query can be subset
</I>&gt;<i> to only the stuff that's really meaningful to do at prefetch-time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The srcset proposal, on the other hand, are purely HINTS to the browser
</I>&gt;<i> engine about the resources. They are only declarative hints that can be
</I>&gt;<i> leveraged in a secret sauce way (like Bruce said in another mail) to
</I>&gt;<i> always optimize image fetching and other features. If you make a new
</I>&gt;<i> kind of browser (like e.g. Opera mini) it can have its own heuristics
</I>&gt;<i> that make sense *for that single browser* without asking _anyone_.
</I>&gt;<i> Without relying on web authors doing the correct thing, or changing
</I>&gt;<i> anything or even announce to anyone what they are doing. It's opening up
</I>&gt;<i> for innovation, good algorithms and smart uses in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the basic difference, totally different. :-)
</I>
If that's the case, would it make sense to get rid of the @media
attribute on &lt;source&gt; elements in &lt;video&gt; and replace it with @srcset?

Silvia.
