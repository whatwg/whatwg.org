<PRE>Hello Kyle,

On 25 May 2012 13:38, Kyle Huey &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">me at kylehuey.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Yes, you would need to check the entire event dispatch chain for

</I>&gt;<i> event that never &quot;heard&quot; by script in the page can trigger dispatch of an
</I>&gt;<i> event that is &quot;heard&quot; by script.  For example, a click event that bubbles

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was going to begin this reply by saying &quot;Yes, we also covered label and
</I>the 'for' property&quot;, but that doesn't seem to contribute to the
conversation, heh.  Still valid points, though.

We've done a lot of work looking at all the possible ways of events firing
and covered most of them.   If this project was for a particular website,
we would have done what many people do -- inject our own version of
addEventListener and watch it go -- but it is not the case.  All of our
pages are sandboxes in an &lt;iframe&gt; and loaded that way, and we sometimes do
not have control over what can be in the page -- i.e. sites we own but not
directly developed by our team.

Something like a hasEventListener(DOMElement elem) will help us a lot with
what we've done, and we can check for delegates by looking at parent nodes,
siblings, as well as synthetic events.  They are well-documented.

Cheers,
Xav
