</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You're right that changing your breakpoints requires changing all the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I must admit, I am still confused about the pre-loader issue. I'm not

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now (in which case the &lt;meta&gt; variable idea seems to me the only one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that could work).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the current syntax, the idea is that browsers will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> preload the *correct* image from @srcset. &#160;They have all the
</I>&gt;<i> information necessary to make the decision at parse-time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not entirely sure how accurate this is, though. &#160;Some better info
</I>&gt;<i> one way or another would be useful.
</I>
Cool. That makes sense but would require the browser to update it's
pre-parser behaviour I imagine (i.e., scan the whole element rather
than just try as soon as the src has been read - so it's not backward
compatible right now) :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, something similar to your idea certainly seems possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use in an extention of the syntax. &#160;Rather than specifying a w/h
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> component, give a 'case' component that refers to a breakpoint defined
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> elsewhere. &#160;This could even potentially extend into url-templating.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's the conclusion that was come to at the RICG too, and why

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about it though :s
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I was purposely calling back to the post you linked above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gave it some criticism here in WHATWG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah, I thought you were. I'll go have another look because I think I
missed it - I'm only aware of one person feeding back - but then it's
the end of the day and I'm not wholey convinced I won't see your reply
and then remember reading it. It's been a busy day. Cheers Tab.
