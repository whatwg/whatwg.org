I didn't know about the respimg CG until a few days ago (after a couple of days of discussion of responsive image proposals, and months after Ted first posted his image-set proposal to www-style). Checking after the fact, I could find no mention of the term &quot;respimg&quot; or anything else uniquely identifying the community group in the archives of <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">whatwg at whatwg.org</A> or public-html, and no one from the CG that I asked had a recollection of announcing it here. That's the basis for my assumption that most people here didn't know about the CG while it was working on its proposal. Do you have a basis for assuming otherwise?

REgards,
Maciej
