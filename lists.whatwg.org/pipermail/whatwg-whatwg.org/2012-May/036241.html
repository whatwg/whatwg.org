Fair enough. Since nobody has given a reason why patterns would ignore 
imageSmoothingEnabled, and your argument seems reasonable, I've changed 
the spec to require that it affect both.


&gt;<i> IMO the smoothing property should affect everything (perhaps even the 
</I>&gt;<i> aliased lines request that was brought up).  Things like a retro 
</I>&gt;<i> pixel-style game will want a simple option to deliberately 
</I>&gt;<i> alias/nearest-neighbour everything on the canvas, and having the 
</I>&gt;<i> smoothing option affect some things but not others seems to just be an 
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenience.
</I>
I haven't added anything yet for different kinds of line drawing.

</I>
I think the use case of &quot;just do everything at a lower quality&quot; isn't 
really well handled by just disabling anti-aliasing, especially as we go 
forward into really high-resolution screens. If you want something to look 
like it was rendered at 320x240 or something, then render it at that 
resolution using a canvas with those dimensions and then scale it to 
another canvas using imageSmoothing disabled.

(Might still not work since the 320x480 canvas could itself be backed 
with a high res store...)
