I haven't been part of the discussion neither in the CG or in here, so
I won't express strong opinions since I can very easily have
misunderstood things.

However, it seems to me that if a lot of discussion had happened in
the CG, especially with a lot of expertize there around what authors
want, then why put a proposal that goes against theirs into the HTML
spec and announce this on the whatwg list?

If their proposal wasn't deemed good enough, then the most appropriate
action would seem to be engage in discussion in that CG and point out
why their proposal is problematic! Simply reading their input and
putting a different proposal into the spec is remeniscent of how
various W3C groups work where they take input on their public list,
then discuss amongst themselves on a private list and put what they
thought was the best solution into the spec. That behavior has led to
plenty of bad specifications and is something we've campaigned heavily
against. Instead we've requested that all discussions happen on the
same list so that everyone can participate.

(The difference that the w3c lists were private is not really a
meaningful difference if we're telling people to join CGs and do
development there).

Apologies if this did actually happen and I missed it.
