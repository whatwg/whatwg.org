This is a true problem.


&gt;<i> ## Proposed Solution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Add an attribute to &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot;&gt; called &quot;hash&quot;.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; hash=&quot;sha1&quot; salt=&quot;something&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will indicate to the browser that it needs to hash the value 
</I>&gt;<i> locally before sending it to the server.  This hash should include a 
</I>&gt;<i> site-specific salt, so that the same password typed on two different 
</I>&gt;<i> sites will hash to different values.  I propose the default salt to be 
</I>&gt;<i> the origin as an ASCII string (protocol + host + port, ex: 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="http://example.com:80">http://example.com:80</A>&quot;), and the default hash to be &quot;none&quot; (in order 
</I>&gt;<i> for backward compatibility).
</I>
It has to be a per-user salt, not per-site. If you do it per-site, then an 
attacker just has to hash all the common passwords and common dictionary 
words and other likely words to get a big table they can compare against 
the hashes. If it's per-user, the complexity is multiplied by the number 
of users, which makes this dramatically harder.

Unfortunately it's not clear how you would do a per-user salt. All the 
user agent has is the username, which you don't really want to use as a 
salt since that would preclude changing it.

(We can't rely on the author providing a unique salt; the assumption here 
is that the author is not familiar with good security practices. If the 
author was able to do that, then we wouldn't have a problem to solve in 
the first place.)

There are quite a few actually.

   &lt;input type=hidden name=_charset_&gt;
   &lt;input type=text name=a dirname=b&gt;
   &lt;input type=image name=c&gt;

After an activation of the image, the above results in the following 
fields and values:

   _charset_ = utf-8
           a = 
           b = ltr
         c.x = 0
         c.y = 0

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The disadvantage to this approach is that, years from now, the default 
</I>&gt;<i> may be compromised (like md5).
</I>
At that time, we could provide a way to change the hash function.


&gt;<i> By always forcing the webmaster to choose a value, it helps to make it a 
</I>&gt;<i> conscious choice, as opposed to &quot;just add `hash` to all input tags&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>
We are assuming here that the authors are not able to make a good 
conscious choice. If they were, there wouldn't be a problem for us to 
sovle in the first place.


&gt;<i> If there is a default hash, then it will be the first target for hackers 
</I>&gt;<i> to break.
</I>
I'm pretty sure they don't need any more motivation. :-)

Agreed, unfortunately.

That's possible. CSS or some components framework.

(I haven't added passwordEquals() because it's trivial to just compare 
them by doing a.value == b.value, and we can't realistically remove the 
capability to do that so there's no win from the method.)


&gt;<i> Note that the confirmation input in

</I>&gt;<i> is optional.
</I>
That's intentional. If they don't match, there's already an error, so 
making it required doesn't help.

</I>
I don't understand what problem this solves. Can you elaborate?


&gt;<i> **cookies**
</I>&gt;<i> Putting a session (+user) in a cookie.
</I>&gt;<i> - broken by standard (none standard SLD fix in every browser)
</I>
Not sure what you mean here.


&gt;<i> - disabled or not supported by many clients for various reasons
</I>
Cookies work pretty uniformly as far as I can tell. After all, that's what 
almost every site uses.


&gt;<i> - leaves footsteps on hdd per definition
</I>
No more so than HTTP auth, right?


&gt;<i> **HTTP-Auth**
</I>&gt;<i> Basic or Digest Access Auth
</I>&gt;<i> - the &quot;right&quot; way to authenticate
</I>
I don't see why it's right. It has all kinds of problems -- poorly defined 
session duration, depends on the password being unchanged during the 
session, and we'd have to add all kinds of APIs to make it possible to do 
custom login/logout, handle session closure, support OAuth et al, handle 
account creation and handling &quot;forgot password&quot; paths, etc.


&gt;<i> - the browser may give the user the full controle/overview over page
</I>&gt;<i> logins
</I>
Sites seem to do this pretty well themselves, currently. Is there a need 
for more?


&gt;<i> - very simple to set up
</I>
I'm not sure it's really that much simpler than cookies.

There's two ways to fix that... add support for the features, or remove 
the features altogether. :-)
