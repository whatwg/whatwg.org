<PRE>If there was a way to do this in JS, we'd have found it. Every time we
run up against the pre-fetch problem. In fact, it is only the
pre-fetch problem that causes responsive images to be an issue at all.
It'd be trivial to fix with JS otherwise.

Also, i don't think non-pixel based layouts can be easily dismissed.
It's where the whole movement is going and already pixel based MQ are
described as limited and not a best practice.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is fit for this round of spec. It is in direct conflict
</I>&gt;<i> with preloading/prefetching. It's a different model and requires a
</I>&gt;<i> different fix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Model 1, before load: do image decision, fetch image while loading the page
</I>&gt;<i> Model 2, after load: load page, do image decision after layout
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> srcset is using model 1, which is faster and in the same way images are
</I>&gt;<i> done today. I don't think you'll be able to convince vendors to ditch
</I>&gt;<i> that optimization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> media queries is doing model 2. I suggest we find a way to do that with
</I>&gt;<i> javascript. Maybe some form of deferring image loading at all, saying
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;I will fetch image on my own&quot;. Then you can do the delayed image
</I>&gt;<i> loading that would need to happen in a media query world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a fix for model 1, doesn't hinder something for model 2 to come
</I>&gt;<i> at a later point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now suppose that for that layout displayed in their screenshot, the header
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image was changed to be a vertical oriented phone and the size was reduced.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In that case, I would want srcset to kick in with a different image. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sounds like it would not be able to accomplish this right now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you're right about that. Or it could work in the current proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't really think it's worth it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec does have an algorithm for updating the image that does a new
</I>&gt;<i> fetch and show, but it's not required to run it. So you can't really
</I>&gt;<i> depend on it. But it can work. If it has already fetched a bigger
</I>&gt;<i> image, and has that in cache, it might not want to fetch a smaller one
</I>&gt;<i> when you rotate though. Why show something of worse quality than what
</I>&gt;<i> you already cache?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the intrinsic sizes are different, well, the user agent doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> know that until it has downloaded the image anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO that should rather be done with a model 2. That means, in the
</I>&gt;<i> short term: finding a way to solve it using client side javascript.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in clear text: I don't think that should be supported by imgsrc.
</I>&gt;<i> That's a job for a media query. Model 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Forgive me if I'm just missing something. It's early and my coffee hasn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kicked in quite yet. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I would be very happy if you didn't top-post, and also trimmed your
</I>&gt;<i> quotes so that it's easy to follow and read (I read email on my phone
</I>&gt;<i> when I'm out, and I love when people write emails that work nicely on
</I>&gt;<i> the phone).
