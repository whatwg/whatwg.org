&lt;video&gt; is a special case, unfortunately.  It would be difficult to
avoid using &lt;source&gt; there, but we shouldn't look at it as a good
example in general.  Using &lt;source&gt; introduces a lot of problems that
would be good to avoid if possible.

&gt;<i> From a semantic point of view this is a terrible mix of everything -
</I>&gt;<i> something that the picture proposal with multiple sources was not.
</I>
There's no semantics in here - this is all presentation and usability.
 This is just a very compact way to state the information that
&lt;picture&gt; presented more verbosely.

&lt;img srcset=&quot;foo.jpg 600w 2x&quot;&gt; is no more a &quot;terrible mix of everything&quot; than

&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source src=foo.jpg media=&quot;min-width:600px&quot; resolution=2&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

is.

&gt;<i> Let's not forget that this is a new use case - one that might get more
</I>&gt;<i> complex with more UA changes in the future. Maybe we have holographic images
</I>&gt;<i> soon with a X Y and Z position. Shoehorning this into the IMG element
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't make much sense to me.
</I>
We should take care not to be future-hostile, but designing for all
hypothetical futures just results in muddled, hard-to-use designs.
Among current MQs, there are 2/4 (depending on if you count min/max
separate) queries you definitely want to use, and one that *might* be
useful (and which can be added to the microsyntax cleanly).

I'm not aware of proposed future MQs that would be useful to tie into
this functionality, either.


&gt;<i> embed is the fallback to video with various sources. img is the fallback to
</I>&gt;<i> embed. I'd like to see picture - done like video for consistency as it is a
</I>&gt;<i> new use case for images. Old browsers could disregard them and new ones can
</I>&gt;<i> use mediaqueries to apply the different sources as needed. Yes, mediaqueries
</I>&gt;<i> do not all the things we need here and browsers have bugs loading various
</I>&gt;<i> sources instead of only one but these are things to fix in the browser
</I>&gt;<i> engines, not add an extra use case in the spec.
</I>
See the blog post I wrote today so I'd have to stop giving this same
argument over and over again. ^_^ &lt;<A HREF="http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4Hv0">http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4Hv0</A>&gt;.
 You simply can't make a good decision about which resolution to send
to the user based on information from Media Queries.
