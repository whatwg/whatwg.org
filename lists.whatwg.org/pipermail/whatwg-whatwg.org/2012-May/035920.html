<PRE>I have joined this list after reading @wilto's a list apart article (<A HREF="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-images-and-web-standards-at-the-turning-point/">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-images-and-web-standards-at-the-turning-point/</A>) and realised it was about time I stopped sitting on the sideline and get involved in the debate.

I have searched the archives as best as I can over the last hour or so, so forgive me if this is regurgitated.

First, I would like to suggest throwing &lt;img srcset&gt; out the window and into a landfill somewhere (It's not even fit for recycling!). This reminds me if the recent semi-colon in JavaScript &quot;debate&quot; that erupted as a result of @fat's code in the Twitter Bootstrap project - To one or two people who are very specialised in their particular area, it seems like a non issue - and I think that is the case with the &lt;img srcset&gt; syntax. From a browser developer point of view it might be easier to implement, but from a &quot;I'm just learning to code&quot; point of view, that syntax is bat-shit crazy!

Second, I'll add my support for the proposed &lt;picture&gt; + &lt;source&gt; tag version, as a much more readable implementation, and also shows similarity with the &lt;video&gt; tag already in use, so it should be easier to pick up.

Finally, wouldn't it be more productive in the long run to define a &quot;template&quot; if you will for situations where alternate versions of the same &quot;element&quot; are required. Obviously, we already have &lt;video&gt; + &lt;source&gt;, perhaps before long &lt;picture&gt; + &lt;source&gt;, and I am sure there are others. 

(What was the reason for ditching the &lt;object&gt; + &lt;param&gt; tags again? because we just seem to be re-implementing them with different names!)

Paul
