</I>
Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but wouldn&#8217;t this same reasoning apply to layouts that depend heavily on media queries? 

The primary characteristics in play are screen size and resolution. I doubt any UAs will be forced to misinterpret common media queries because they haven&#8217;t been accounted for. I doubt UAs could, in fact&#8212;or would care. It wouldn&#8217;t be a matter of neglecting to support their product. It would be a matter of neglecting to supporting a screen at 310px wide.

This is to say nothing of the fact that the objective of a responsive layout _is_ to properly accommodate the widest possible range of displays. The things you&#8217;re trying to prevent are the things we&#8217;re trying to avoid anyway.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What authors _can_ do and user agents _cannot_ do is describe their
</I>&gt;<i> images. Such metadata never needs to be misinterpreted and allows user
</I>&gt;<i> agents to iterate and improve the end-user experience even when the
</I>&gt;<i> author either does not care about them, or has moved on, or is long
</I>&gt;<i> dead. Is authors not caring about user agents a real problem?
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly is - witness Opera's failed efforts to get authors to
</I>&gt;<i> support more than Webkit, witness the widespread inaccessibility of
