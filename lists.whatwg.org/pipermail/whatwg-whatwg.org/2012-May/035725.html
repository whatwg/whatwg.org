</I>&gt;<i> addressing this, however phonetically spelling out a word, and seeing a 
</I>&gt;<i> list of words containing the one you were trying to spell out is 
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically more effective than the counterpart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It vastly aids those with lacking a thorough Arabic education to 
</I>&gt;<i> properly to spell out what they phonetically know, hence allows a 
</I>&gt;<i> greater audience including non-natives to write in Arabic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Proposal:*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have the interpreter described above be embedded within browsers and 
</I>&gt;<i> enabled when users click and focus on text fields defined as: &lt;input

</I>&gt;<i> Arabizi&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet</A>&gt;as Arabic. 
</I>&gt;<i> Should a browser not support it, then the &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; would be 
</I>&gt;<i> the fallback attribute leaving users writing in a plain text field.
</I>
As far as I can tell, nothing stops a Web browser or operating system from 
implementing this kind of thing today. No need for the specification to 
say anything special.

Supporting this kind of thing is definitely on the table, but as you hint 
above, it needs more research first.

I don't understand. Everybody has an operating system. Why would putting 
things in the operating system limit availability? Operating systems and 
their GUIs are responsible for almost everything that a browser does, at 
one level or another.

</I>
Indeed. From the spec's point of view, they're more or less equivalent.
