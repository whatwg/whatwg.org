With current codecs, and given human perception of visual images, videos can be decoded at multiple resolutions without as obvious visual degradation as images. Even at 1:1 scale, videos as served by many popular sites have significant visual artifacts. So for videos, we're still in the real of straight tradeoff of visual quality for bandwidth and/or size. Generally, increasing the bitrate will increase quality on all displays, and there's not much purpose to doing it selectively.

In theory, resolution-based selection could apply to the poster attribute of &lt;video&gt;, as well as to &lt;input type=img src&gt;. But it seems reasonable to figure things out fully and get some deployment experience with img before extending this feature.
