</I>&gt;<i> &lt;picture&gt; in its current form is unable to support bandwidth-based negotiation well (and that's not simply a matter of adding bandwidth media query) and has no mechanism to specify scaling factor for intrinsic sizes of images.
</I>
Is there currently any documentation explaining how bandwidth is better handled by `srcset`? Seeing as any discussion around bandwidth is almost entirely theoretical, I have a hard time understanding where bandwidth concerns preclude one approach or the other.

There&#8217;s a case to be made that few people implementing any form of &#8220;responsive images&#8221; solution will find a need to rely on an image&#8217;s intrinsic width, as doing so effectively negates any flexibility to begin with, which is almost entirely the point of either solution. This is a valid point, however, and very likely something that we could solve on the implementor&#8217;s side.

There&#8217;s no prior precedent this sort of thing&#8212;there&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t find a way to preserve an image&#8217;s intrinsic width using `picture`. I wonder if simply adding `width` and `height` attributes on the element (similar to `img`) might solve this, in the event that the author wants to rely on an intrinsic size instead of CSS?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO those are pretty serious drawbacks that limit its functionality, which is much worse than &quot;ugly, but gets job done&quot; state of srcset.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two categories of use-cases (&quot;art-directed&quot; and &quot;dpi/optimization&quot;) and &lt;picture&gt; is suited for only one of them, so please don't frame the decision as &quot;discarding&quot; of a perfectly good solution, as it wasn't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> srcset addresses both dpi/optimisation and art-directed use-cases. It has its own problems, such as confusing microsyntax, so suggestions how to improve this are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lamenting &lt;picture&gt; and accusing WHATWG of wrongdoing is not productive.
</I>
Andr&#233; didn&#8217;t seem to claim any loyalty to one solution or the other and, unless I&#8217;ve missed something earlier in the thread, certainly didn&#8217;t accuse anyone of &#8220;wrongdoing.&#8221; You&#8217;ve jumped to an oddly defensive place here, and that only reinforces an &#8220;us vs. them&#8221; perception that I&#8217;m certain we&#8217;d all prefer to move away from. I know I would.

&gt;<i> If you'd like to see &lt;picture&gt; proposal succeed, then please help fixing its drawbacks. Make selection and embedding of 2x images easier. Give UA freedom to use cached higher-quality images when it can. Give UA freedom to choose images to minimize bandwidth or maximize quality. Reduce verbosity of most common cases.
</I>
This is where I assumed we would be working with you, and I continue to hope that we can. I&#8217;d really prefer there not be &#8220;sides&#8221; in this, rather than all of us seeking the best possible solution. If you feel `picture` could have potential given improvements on the UA end, well, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for&#8212;your input, and your collective expertise.

If we can bring `picture` in line with what implementors have in mind while preserving something close to the markup pattern authors prefer, we&#8217;ll have a solution that benefits everyone equally.

&gt;<i> I've tried to raise those issues on the Responsive Images group's mailinglist, but got no constructive feedback.
</I>
We were admonished in an earlier thread for using the RICG&#8217;s mailing list to work in a vacuum (though it was seldom used, and any meaningful conclusions were published to the RICG). If this is the correct forum for these ongoing discussions, it&#8217;s likely best that we keep it here.
