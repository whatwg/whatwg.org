I doubt whether support for non-integer scale factors/arbitrary DPI is  
going to be useful in practice.

While it's relatively easy to resize photos for any DPI, it's not  
desirable from caching/processing perspective (hosting and serving as many  
different variants of a file as there are screen densities). A pragmatic  
solution is to have few sizes and serve a good enough size, which may as  
well be integer multiplies of a CSS pixel.

And when it's important to serve pixel-perfect images for arbitrary DPI,  
then probably it's equally important to have pixel-perfect CSS as well.  
Unfortunately, it's very hard to write device-pixel-perfect CSS for  
non-integer multiplies of a CSS pixel. I don't expect many (if any)  
authors to actually write `border: 0.6024096386px solid` to achieve this.

Most artists won't spend time to prepare dozens of pixel-perfect manually  
resized versions of icons for varying screen densities, so most of the  
time assets for resolutions between 1x and maximum will be automatically  
resized one way or another.

Therefore, I expect browsers/systems to continue using fake 96dpi/192dpi  
snapped to device pixels, and artists to focus only on those ratios. It's  
simplest for everybody and gives device-pixel-perfect rendering on varying  
screen densities.
