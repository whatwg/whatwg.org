</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> does't, so it can never be used in the manner you're describing.
</I>
iPhone knows when it's on GPRS/EDGE, so it can implement logic exactly as I've described it. 

What it doesn't know is exact numerical value representing current bandwidth and latency. 


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UAs are also free to download 1x image first, and then 2x image after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> onload, etc. Declarative nature of descriptors, as opposed to imperative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MQs, allows UAs to innovate in this area and come up with new uses that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors didn't predict/express in MQ.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be no better than current JS approaches, in fact making it
</I>&gt;<i> worse by adding to the page load size rather than optimising it.
</I>
The point is UA can do whatever gives better experience. UAs can innovate in this area. For example phones know when they're on expensive roaming connection and always download lowest-res images, without needing authors to add (bandwidth-cost:expensive) MQ. 

&gt;&gt;<i> The syntax allows addition of &quot;KB&quot; descriptor later, which &#161;&#170; assuming UAs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will figure out how to measure actual bandwidth well enough &#161;&#170; will allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even more sophisticated selection based on file size (rather than only 1x/2x
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scale factors which are only a proxy for the file size).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As above; this seems set not to happen. Besides, how is it going to
</I>&gt;<i> know the file size unless you explicitly state it in the srcset
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere?
</I>
Setting explicit filesize may be an option. With current spec UA can safely assume that 1x image is smaller than 2x. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (and that's not simply a matter of adding bandwidth media
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> query) and has no mechanism to specify scaling factor for intrinsic sizes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of images.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not actually sure what &quot;intrinsic sizes of images&quot; means.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A default size of the image when you don't specify any size in HTML/CSS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, OK thanks :) I do not ever set intrinsic sizes, and nor does any
</I>&gt;<i> site I have seen that is responsive in nature. Precisely because it
</I>&gt;<i> has no meaning or use in a responsive site.
</I>
intrinsic size is the one you don't set. Size in &lt;img width&gt; or CSS width: overrides intrinsic size. 

&gt;&gt;<i> To take advantage of 200dpi displays you need to tell UA to render a X px
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image at X/2 CSS px. Explicit width/height breaks adaptive mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or you do what we do now and supply a double resolution image and set
</I>&gt;<i> it to a given CSS size.
</I>
That requires relatively large amount of effort &#161;&#170; putting image sizes for all breakpoints in CSS, with same media queries, and ensuring you have unique selector for the image.

That's 5-10 lines of code for what you get with mere 2 characters in srcset. 

And when intrinsic size is usable you can use it for images with variable size (e.g. known width, but height dependent on aspect ratio of the image)

&gt;<i> Or just any old size, from my experience of
</I>&gt;<i> the iPad3 you don't actually need to be that specific, just get an
</I>&gt;<i> oversized image and let it shrink a bit and it holds up well.
</I>
That is true for devices which use zoom a lot, but may be suboptimal on desktops. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I see no difference between the end result of either syntax. Both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> approaches fail utterly in abstracting the query from the mark-up,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which means both approaches are suited only to individual images.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> True. An URI template can be added later to either solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see idea's on how this might work.
</I>
Just throwing an idea here:

&lt;img srcset=&quot;gravatar?s={grsize}&quot;&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
@breakpoint &quot;grsize&quot;:&quot;80&quot;;

@media (max-width:320px) {
   @breakpoint &quot;grsize&quot;:&quot;40&quot;;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

I'm not sure about using &lt;style&gt;, as it cannot work in external CSS (we can't ask UAs to wait).
However declaration may need more syntax than just &lt;meta&gt; to allow separate groups of breakpoints. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And &lt;meta breakpoint&gt; has same limitations for DPI adaptation as &lt;source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> media&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are two categories of use-cases (&quot;art-directed&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;dpi/optimization&quot;) and &lt;picture&gt; is suited for only one of them, so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> please don't frame the decision as &quot;discarding&quot; of a perfectly good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> solution, as it wasn't.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Picture dealt with both of these by simple use of the pixel density
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> media query - i.e, in exactly the same way CSS already does it. I do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not understand your argument.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;picture&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;source src=&quot;200px&quot; media=&quot;(min-device-pixel-ratio:2)&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;source src=&quot;100px&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/picture&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This will only choose between large pixelated image and small pixelated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image, and will not make use of high display density.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On it's own you're right. But no-one actually builds a site like that.
</I>&gt;<i> If you're doing a fluid responsive site you've got img {
</I>&gt;<i> max-width:100% } in there, and in that case you do actually take
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of the high DPI.
</I>
Scaling is awful for 96dpi displays. You may want to have floated images or buttons/banners at exact size. 

max-width is OK in many cases, but the solution would be limited if it were the only usable option. 

I believe 200dpi images will be more important in the future than 1x images, so no easy method to embed non-100%-wide highdpi image will be a pain for developers.
