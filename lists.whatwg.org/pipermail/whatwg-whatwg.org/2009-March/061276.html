Perhaps the buggy code was only sent to IE, and Firefox got more
reasonable code. If the firmware had working code for both Firefox and
the latest stable version of IE, that would explain the company's
reluctance to see a problem.

Another reason might be that this firmware only runs on old routers
and no firmware updates are being released for it, so few users would
run into the problem with trying to update firmware. What firmware was
this, exactly?

&gt;<i> Opera was the first doing this and we hit a few issues as well so we decided
</I>&gt;<i> to go with a simple prefix (C:\fake_path\ changed to C:\fakepath\ now per
</I>&gt;<i> discussion with Microsoft). It looks a bit ugly, but it's not at all the
</I>&gt;<i> issue that same make it out to be I think. (E.g. the initial email claimed
</I>&gt;<i> this inconsistency between the DOM and HTTP would cause issues for Web
</I>&gt;<i> application developers...)
</I>
Example: A site lets a user upload a file and write some comments
associated with that file. On the browser side, a new input element is
dynamically created with the name and id &quot;Notes for
C:\fakepath\upload.txt&quot;. On the server side, the server receives
&quot;upload.txt&quot; and looks for &quot;Notes for upload.txt&quot; to match. It of
course is not there because the programmer had no idea that the
browser would be adding appending a fake path in JavaScript but not in
HTTP.
