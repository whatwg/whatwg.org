</I>
It is unclear to me why you would need access to the cookies from script 
to do cookie-based authentication. Isn't the server the one that sets the 
cookie and the one that uses it when it is returned?

Could you elaborate on how you see the cookie API being used?

I do not think there is a problem with providing self.cookie in workers, 
exposing the cookie of the script. However, currently there doesn't seem 
to be much support for this.

What do other browser vendors think of this?

Jonas, given the above information regarding IE's behaviour, do you still 
think that providing such an API in workers is a problem?

</I>
These seem like good use cases, but it's not clear what the user interface 
would look like, which is probably the hardest problem here.


&gt;<i> Gears had an explicit permissions variable applications could check, 
</I>&gt;<i> which seems valuable - do we do anything similar elsewhere in HTML5 that 
</I>&gt;<i> we could use as a model here?
</I>
HTML5 so far has avoided anything that requires explicit permission 
grants, because they are generally a bad idea from a security perspective 
(users will grant any permissions the system asks them for).


&gt;<i> An application can create a persistent worker via the PersistentWorker() 
</I>&gt;<i> constructor:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     var worker = new PersistentWorker('worker.js', 'core');
</I>
This seems reasonable. I would recommend calling this something like
&quot;ChromiumPersistentWorker&quot; or some such during the experimental phase, so 
as to not limit what the spec can call the feature later, though, once we 
have implementation experience and can make more educated decisions as to 
the design of the feature.


&gt;<i> The namespace for PersistentWorkers are identical to those of 
</I>&gt;<i> SharedWorkers - for example, if you already have a PersistentWorker 
</I>&gt;<i> named 'core' under a domain and a window tries to create a SharedWorker 
</I>&gt;<i> named 'core', a security exception will be thrown, just as if a 
</I>&gt;<i> different URL had been specified for two identically-named 
</I>&gt;<i> SharedWorkers.
</I>
Why would we not want them to use different namespaces?


&gt;<i> To enable these interactions, we'd add something like the following new 
</I>&gt;<i> APIs to the global scope for persistent workers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> void open(url, optional target, optional feature, optional replace) - 
</I>&gt;<i> opens a browser window, just like the window.open() API which is 
</I>&gt;<i> available from page context
</I>
I would be very concerned about this getting abused for popups. I don't 
think we want to allow arbitrary windows to be opened. I could see 
allowing a kind of simple toast popup that pops up a link which, when 
clicked, _then_ opens a window; would that work? Something like:

   void notify(message, url);


&gt;<i> There isn't currently any way for workers (persistent or otherwise) to 
</I>&gt;<i> talk to one another without the intervention of a window, even when 
</I>&gt;<i> those workers exist under the same domain.
</I>
Shared workers can be opened from within workers.


&gt;<i> Additionally, there's no good way for workers under different domains to 
</I>&gt;<i> talk to one another (a window can use the cross-domain messaging 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality to talk to other domains, but there's no analog for this 
</I>&gt;<i> for workers).
</I>
This has been intentionally delayed while we wait for more implementation 
experience.

The spec actually already defines this, using the term &quot;script's character 
encoding&quot;. However, this is confusing since it doesn't always correlate 
with the actual encoding used for the script.

I have renamed this term to avoid the confusion.

I have updated the spec accordingly, so that all the occurances of 
MessagePort in method arguments and in events is now instead 
MessagePortArray.

This has apparently been filed as a bug now. I have not changed the spec.

This is now clarified, I hope.


&gt;<i> The other issue i bumped into is behaviour of ImageData/CanvasPixelArray

</I>
Fixed.
