Do you agree that null and empty string should behave differently for &quot;search&quot; and &quot;hash&quot;? To me, it doesn't make sense to treat null and the empty string differently for some components but not others.

Ok. I'll assume there is valid reasoning behind that. Replace all the &quot;throw&quot;s with &quot;be silently ignored&quot; in my proposal.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Changing from an authority to a non-authority URI or the other way 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; around doesn't seem desirable to me (and would only work for unknown 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; schemes anyway, presumably, at best; it's better if it just never works).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does it matter? Since it's an unknown scheme, it's basically opaque data. You can't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dereference it and fetch the resource it points to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, but you can pass it off to a helper application.  In any case, my 
</I>&gt;<i> comment above was more concerned with your proposal that one should be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to create a non-authority http: URI than about unknown schemes.
</I>
I don't think my proposal allowed creation of a non-authority http: URI. I said that 'Attempts to set &quot;host&quot; to null for a scheme known to require an authority should throw.' Since http is a scheme known to require an authority, you wouldn't be able to null out the authority. The one loophole I missed would be to create a non-http non-authority URI and then change the scheme to http. That can be fixed by amending the first sentence of my proposal to the following:

- Attempts to set &quot;protocol&quot; to null, the empty string, or anything containing invalid characters (i.e. not in the &quot;scheme&quot; production of RFC3986) should throw. Setting it to a scheme known to require an authority when the authority component is null should also throw. Setting it to a scheme known to require no authority when the authority component is non-null should also throw. Setting it to anything else should be allowed and should update the scheme component of the underlying URI.

(With appropriate adjustments of s/throw/be silently ignored/)

Cheers,
kats
