Sorry...  make that persistentLifetime  + tabScope doesn't make sense.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that race conditions and synchronization are too hard for developers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; deal with. The spec should forbid asynchronously visible changes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; cookies or localStorage. In fact, it should probably simply say that all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; script execution is serializable: always equivalent to some execution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you could get with a single-threaded browser that runs all scripts to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; completion. Allowance could be made for explicit yield points if we need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to, e.g. alert().
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generally speaking I have tried to maintain this invariant, but I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failed with cookies, and with localStorage in workers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Some sort of implicit locking with guaranteed deadlock freedom should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; workable for parallel browser implementations. For example, partition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; browser contexts into &quot;related&quot; subsets, where context A is related to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; context B if a script running in context A can affect the execution of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; an already-running script in context B. Use one lock per subset, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have a script execution acquire the lock when it first touches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; localStorage or cookies, and drop the lock when it completes (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; yields). Additional optimizations are possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've updated the spec to require the locking mechanism that was in place
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for storage for cookies as well. This still means that one window can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> block all other windows that try to use cookies, though, so I've also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> added navigator.releaseLock() which can be called to explicitly release
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the lock that is put in place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> User agents that share event loops between origins can't actually have any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more than one lock total. Consider a case where there are three windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from three different origins, A, B, and C, where C contains a couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;iframe&gt;s, and where A, B, and C are independent, but C share an event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loop with whatever content is in its iframes. (This is the situation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Chrome and IE are in, as I understand it, with event loops being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per-window not per-origin, and it may be required because access to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frames[] hierarchy is synchronous.) Now, assume A and B have both obtained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their respective locks, and are busy doing some long script. C is free to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run more tasks from its event loop, which could include navigating one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iframe to a page on either A and the other iframe to a page on B, meaning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the event loop of C is now beholden to two locks. If there is any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manner in which to synchronously cause another origin to run script, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now means that C can attempt to obtain both locks; if we now imagine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another window just like C that instead obtains the locks in the reverse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order, we get deadlock.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it can be shown that it is not ever possible for script in one origin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to synchronously invoke script in another origin, then I guess we could
