<PRE>That might work. Is it feasible for user agents to enforce limits on how
long a callback is allowed to run holding the lock? That way workers can't
starve normal pages from accessing their local storage.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the best option is to make access to localstorage asynchronous

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sucks to make such a simple and useful API aync though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand the current API (on main window) to be defined, as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as someone accesses the .localStorage property, the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is supposed to acquire a lock. This lock would be held
</I>&gt;<i> on to until that script returns to the event loop for that thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if javascript in another window, running in another thread or
</I>&gt;<i> process, tries to access .localStorage for the same origin, the
</I>&gt;<i> .localStorage getter would try to acquire the same lock and block
</I>&gt;<i> until the first thread releases the lock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could in theory be applied to applied to workers as well. However
</I>&gt;<i> as Jeremy points out that could result in the a worker script running
</I>&gt;<i> for a very long time blocking the window thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we could do, is to have an API like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> getLocalStorage(callback);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This function returns immediately, but will then call the callback
</I>&gt;<i> function as soon as the localStorage becomes available and the lock
</I>&gt;<i> been acquired. This would always happen asynchronously off the event
</I>&gt;<i> loop, which means that once the callback returns the lock is released
</I>&gt;<i> again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it would still mean that a window context or worker could
</I>&gt;<i> hold on to the lock for an indefinite time, but as long as the asych
</I>&gt;<i> getLocalStorage API is used, this means that no thread is blocked,
</I>&gt;<i> just that they aren't able to get access to the localStorage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So for example, the following code would safely add 1 to the 'foo'
</I>&gt;<i> property in localStorage:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> getLocalStorage(function(store) {
</I>&gt;<i>  store.foo = parseInt(store.foo, 10) + 1;
</I>&gt;<i> });
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, we would have to define that if the store object passed
</I>&gt;<i> to the callback function is accessed outside after the callback has
</I>&gt;<i> ended this will throw an exception. If the object is reactivated next
</I>&gt;<i> time a callback is entered, or if a new storage object is created also
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be defined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This new API I believe is good enough to be used both from workers and
</I>&gt;<i> window contexts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could even keep the current API implemented in IE8, or we could
</I>&gt;<i> just ask people to write a wrapper for IE8 like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> function getLocalStorage(callback) {
</I>&gt;<i>  setTimeout(function() { callback(localStorage); }, 0);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in an implementation that implements correct locking for the
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous API, this will even produce the correct locking behavior
</I>&gt;<i> for the new API.
