I don't believe I've seen many bugs along these lines for Firefox... 
can't think of any, in fact.  It seems that the number of such sites 
might be low enough that we don't need to cater to them.

Put another way, the costs of changing this in Gecko seem, to me, to 
outweigh the benefits.

It doesn't feel that this is an area where we need more compatibility at 
the moment, and I'm pretty strongly opposed to the spec enshrining this 
behavior.

In fact, if the spec did not specify such a behavior it would be easier 
to convince sites to fix their code instead of making bogus assumptions 
about the return value...

&gt;<i> I agree. Unfortunately, sometimes we are unable to make choices that end

</I>
While true, this doesn't seem like one of those cases, to me.
