No, it says mutual *agreement*, not supplemental norms.  ISO 
8601:2004 seems perfectly clear that the year before 0001 is 0000, 
and that -0002-04-12 means &quot;The twelfth of April in the second year 
before the year [0000] &quot; (example directly from ISO 8601).  The HTML 
spec. can constitute such agreement.

I see no reason to forbid such uses in HTML.  Can you?

&gt;<i>If we're only interested in the representation of dates - and not

</I>
They are nothing like free if you want UAs to support them.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I said above this seems inconsistent with your position on year 
</I>&gt;<i>zero. If we're only interested in date representations and not in

</I>
No.  If my UA wants to present dates to the user in his preferred 
form or calendar system, it helps iut enormously if there is only one 
way to represent a date, from which it has to convert.  If there are 
two, and the conversion of the second is a pain (which Julian is), 
this is a problem.

&gt;<i>However, if we're interested in comparing dates within a machine 
</I>&gt;<i>readable attribute than it is very important how year zero and other 
</I>&gt;<i>non-positive years are handled. I'm not trying to say gotcha here, 
</I>&gt;<i>I'm trying to understand how you see these machine readable dates 
</I>&gt;<i>being used. Are we interested in only date representation or also in 
</I>&gt;<i>date comparison?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I don't think there is any legitimate reason to add support for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>*two* competing time formats (the current spec format and unix

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>into the supported timestamp format, then represent it however you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>want within your page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>However, this places a burden on authors that could be more easily 
</I>&gt;<i>handled by implementations. When an author cites a historical date 
</I>&gt;<i>they are often interested in it as the Julian date. Why should an 
</I>&gt;<i>author need to go convert the date to Gregorian date every time the 
</I>&gt;<i>author wants to use this HTML feature?
</I>
So the UA can display it.  If they don't care, leave off the datetime 
attribute.  If you are unsure of the conversion, say so in the text:

&lt;date datetime=&quot;0707-04-04&gt;Two days after the new moon of the 
festival of Artemis, Alexis the Orphanotropos visiting Philadelphia 
[conversion to Gregorian date is the best estimate of the 
translator]&lt;/date&gt;

&gt;<i>Especially if date representation is the goal and not date 
</I>&gt;<i>comparison, there should be no reason an author cannot use the same 
</I>&gt;<i>ISO 8601-style representations for Julian dates.
</I>
Representation is a minor issue.  Definition of the name &quot;julian&quot;, of 
the valid values of the attribute, and of the calendar &quot;julian&quot;, are, 
and the cost to UAs of implementing it.
