<PRE>There hasn't been much discussion of this yet... a few comments on the list
between august and november of 2008...
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [michaeln] How do workers and appCaches interact?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [ian] workers are associated with browsing contexts, so they go through
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; normal app cache networking changes. This probably interacts badly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with shared workers used from different app caches. We should probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; study this more.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Aaron, Maciej, others, do you have opinions on how these should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interact?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [michaeln] Seems reasonable to spec that dedicated workers are very
</I>related to
&gt;<i> their owner, execute in a child browsing context, and consequently
</I>&gt;<i> inherit the same appCache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems reasonable to spec that shared workers are associated with a
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context that is very distinct from their clients. Akin to an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;auxiliary top-level browsing context&quot;.
</I>
[ian] The above seems reasonable...


&gt;<i> Beyond that it gets less clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do sharedWorker.js documents need a &lt;html manifest='url'&gt; equivalent?
</I>
They don't have one today. I don't really want to add one...


&gt;<i> Should a shraredWorker loaded from appCacheA be distinct from a named
</I>&gt;<i> shared worker loaded from appCacheB or from the network?
</I>
That seems like a reasonable possibility too...


I haven't fixed this yet.

&gt;<i> I'm trying to understand the ApplicationCache spec as it applies to
</I>&gt;<i> workers, but I didn't find anything promising when I searched the archives.
</I>&gt;<i> Is ApplicationCache intended to apply to workers? The application cache API
</I>&gt;<i> isn't available to workers, but I'm guessing the intent is that if an
</I>&gt;<i> application creates a dedicated worker then worker requests (like
</I>&gt;<i> importScripts()) would come out of the cache inherited from the parent
</I>&gt;<i> document. If not, then it seems impossible to support running workers when
</I>&gt;<i> in offline mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since SharedWorkers are shared by multiple windows, there's some ambiguity
</I>&gt;<i> about which app cache it should use (perhaps always the one from the creator
</I>&gt;<i> window?) - it seems like an app might get different SharedWorkers() loading
</I>&gt;<i> from different app caches depending on the order in which different windows
</I>&gt;<i> create them, which seems like a dubious outcome. Has this been discussed
</I>&gt;<i> previously?
