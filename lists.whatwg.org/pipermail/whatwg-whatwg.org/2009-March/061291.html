<PRE>
The long and short of it with the c:\fakepath\ issue is that some browser 
vendors have reported compatibility problems with not having this. I 
acknowledge that there is some skepticism about whether this is a serious 
enough issue to warrant this ugly hack, but given that the concerns were 
raised by two browser vendors independently, it seems likely that we 
should heed their advice.

I don't think is a huge issue because we will in due course (when Arun's 
spec is ready) be adding an API to &lt;input type=file&gt; that exposes the 
actual files, filenames, types, etc, and the .value API will be vestigial. 
(The .value API has other issues, like only exposing the first file in a 
multiple-file upload widget.)

Realistically speaking, that seems unlikely to be practical. I wouldn't be 
really surprised that someone would want to upgrade the firmware on a 
device ten years from now, for instance. We never know.


&gt;<i> I agree they're not as happy as they could be, but they're ok.  In 
</I>&gt;<i> addition, is the expected lifetime of the affected device comparable to 
</I>&gt;<i> the expected time it takes to deploy the new behavior in browsers?  If 
</I>&gt;<i> so, it's worth it to contact the device maker and ask them to fix things 
</I>&gt;<i> in their next model instead of working around them.
</I>
We both know that evanglisation efforts don't have a great success rate.


&gt;<i> As far as the &quot;significant number of sites&quot; above... I wonder whether

</I>&gt;<i> certain things about IE only.  We've certainly seen quite a number of 
</I>&gt;<i> issues along those lines: we fix a bug, and discover that sites had 
</I>&gt;<i> written special browser-specific code taking advantage of that bug.
</I>
Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if this was why Opera and IE have seen 
this problem, but Mozilla has not.

That seems like a rather brittle design; what if the user uploads two 
files with the same name, for instance? Or uploads an anonymous file (e.g. 
a file obtained from an on-board camera)? Or changes the selected file? I 
recommend using a unique ID instead, it's much more resilient. :-)

</I>
This is because the Trusted zone gets their less-standards-compliant &quot;IE7&quot; 
mode. I don't think relying on this (or expecting other browsers to do 
this) is a scalable strategy.


Here are some bugs that might be related to this issue:

   <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440991">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440991</A>

I haven't checked if they really are this problem, but it's possible.
