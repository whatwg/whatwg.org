<PRE>
I've updated the specs as follows:

 - removed localStorage from Web Workers for now.

 - extended the implicit lock mechanism that we had for storage to also 
   cover document.cookie, and made the language more explicit about how 
   it works.

 - added navigator.releaseLock().

I've removed localStorage from the Web Workers spec for now.

Agreed. The Database API seems well-suited for this, though.

That's an interesting idea, and would be relatively easy to do. Do people 
think it is worth it?

I don't think making it async helps here, since the problem isn't that it 
is synchronous, but that workers don't return quickly (by design).

Nothing is to stop someone from just having a long callback, though.

Right.

</I>
Indeed. This is a problem with the current API for localStorage in windows 
as well.

I've made the spec explicitly have a single shared lock for all features 
that need locking (currently just .cookie and .localStorage).

The problem is that people will walk into race conditions without 
realising it, and they are amongst the hardest problems to debug.

This is what I've done.

</I>
I've removed the localStorage API from workers.

Terminating the script like that would be really hard to debug also -- 
especially since it would end up terminating differently on different 
computers (e.g. a desktop might execute the whole initialisation code in 
the time alloted, while slower mobile devices might execute only the first 
part and the worker would be in an unstable state).

Since this applies to more than just storage, I've put it on the Navigator 
object. I've called it releaseLock().

</I>
Why would we want more than one lock? Is the potential performance gain 
worth the complexity?

The problem with going with an async approach is that it means changing 
the API, which is something we can't really do for cookie (and don't 
really want to do for localStorage, since IE8 has shipped it.) We we are 
going to need a synchronous locking mechanism anyway.

Generally speaking I have tried to maintain this invariant, but I have 
failed with cookies, and with localStorage in workers.

</I>
I've updated the spec to require the locking mechanism that was in place 
for storage for cookies as well. This still means that one window can 
block all other windows that try to use cookies, though, so I've also 
added navigator.releaseLock() which can be called to explicitly release 
the lock that is put in place.

User agents that share event loops between origins can't actually have any 
more than one lock total. Consider a case where there are three windows 
from three different origins, A, B, and C, where C contains a couple of 
&lt;iframe&gt;s, and where A, B, and C are independent, but C share an event 
loop with whatever content is in its iframes. (This is the situation 
Chrome and IE are in, as I understand it, with event loops being 
per-window not per-origin, and it may be required because access to the 
frames[] hierarchy is synchronous.) Now, assume A and B have both obtained 
their respective locks, and are busy doing some long script. C is free to 
run more tasks from its event loop, which could include navigating one 
iframe to a page on either A and the other iframe to a page on B, meaning 
that the event loop of C is now beholden to two locks. If there is any 
manner in which to synchronously cause another origin to run script, this 
now means that C can attempt to obtain both locks; if we now imagine 
another window just like C that instead obtains the locks in the reverse 
order, we get deadlock.

If it can be shown that it is not ever possible for script in one origin 
to synchronously invoke script in another origin, then I guess we could 
have per-origin locks instead of a single lock.

It can starve itself and anyone that it is related to, which is a problem; 
but it would also, I'm sure, lead to pretty awful bugs that authors 
wouldn't understand how to fix. Are we sure we want to go there?
