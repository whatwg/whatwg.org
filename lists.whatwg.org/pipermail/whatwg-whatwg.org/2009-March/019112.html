We know for sure it's possible to write scripts with racy behaviour, so the
question is whether this ever occurs in the wild. You're claiming it does
not, and I'm questioning whether you really have that data.

I agree that designing cookie races is not a good idea. If we could go back
&gt;<i> in time, we might design a better API for cookies that didn't introduce race
</I>&gt;<i> conditions. However, given where we are today, I'd say that sacrificing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We don't know how much (if any) performance must be sacrificed, because
no-one's tried to implement parallel cookie access with serializability
guarantees. So I don't think we can say what the correct tradeoff is.

In this case, I think the spec should describe the current implementation of
&gt;<i> cookies, warts and all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You mean IE and Chrome's implementation, I presume, since Firefox and Safari
do not allow cookies to be modified during script execution AFAIK. Do we
know exactly what IE7, IE8 and Chrome guarantee around parallel cookie
access?
