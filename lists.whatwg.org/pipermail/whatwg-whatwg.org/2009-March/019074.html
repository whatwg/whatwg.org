No, not really.  Are they treated differently in current UAs (past null 
being treated as &quot;null&quot;, possibly)?

&gt;<i> To me, it doesn't make sense to treat null and the empty string differently for some components but not others.
</I>
Agreed that it would be confusing from a web developer point of view. 
Of course from a URI point of view some URI components can be empty but 
present or can be not present at all, as you point out above.

&gt;&gt;<i> The latter.  The Gecko-internal URI code does in fact throw on a lot of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these setters, and the HTMLAnchorElement methods catch and eat these 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exceptions, very much on purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok. I'll assume there is valid reasoning behind that. Replace all the &quot;throw&quot;s with &quot;be silently ignored&quot; in my proposal.
</I>
For what it's worth, I suspect that the silent fail is somewhat 
interoperably implemented already.

&gt;&gt;<i> No, but you can pass it off to a helper application.  In any case, my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comment above was more concerned with your proposal that one should be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to create a non-authority http: URI than about unknown schemes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think my proposal allowed creation of a non-authority http: URI. I said that 'Attempts to set &quot;host&quot; to null for a scheme known to require an authority should throw.' Since http is a scheme known to require an authority, you wouldn't be able to null out the authority.
</I>
Or set it to the empty string, which has the same effect.  Your proposal 
treats those differently.

&gt;<i> - Attempts to set &quot;protocol&quot; to null, the empty string, or anything containing invalid characters (i.e. not in the &quot;scheme&quot; production of RFC3986) should throw. Setting it to a scheme known to require an authority when the authority component is null should also throw. Setting it to a scheme known to require no authority when the authority component is non-null should also throw. Setting it to anything else should be allowed and should update the scheme component of the underlying URI.
</I>
Honestly, I can't think of a sane way to define a &quot;protocol&quot; setter that 
changes from one URI &quot;type&quot; to another (type being &quot;has authority&quot;, 
&quot;doesn't have authority&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;).  Actually, as far as Gecko is 
concerned there are 5 different types; see the three constants defined 
at 
<A HREF="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/public/nsIStandardURL.idl#56">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/public/nsIStandardURL.idl#56</A> 
for three, plus &quot;not a hierarchichal URI&quot; (which never does the fixup 
from scheme:foo to <A HREF="scheme://foo">scheme://foo</A>) and &quot;unknown&quot; (treated like &quot;not a 
hierarchical URI&quot;).
