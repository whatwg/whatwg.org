If the specifics are not exposed to authors the DOM does not need to get  
involved.


&gt;<i> Instead of an UA supporting
</I>&gt;<i> first XHR, then image, then video, then XY, the status of the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation would be identical in all parts of the UA. Basically,
</I>&gt;<i> it would force implementations to create the CORS dom support with a
</I>&gt;<i> common codebase for all elements that use it, instead of having
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate code which might behave differently.
</I>
I don't think we should be in the business of enforcing how  
implementations implement things. We can certainly encourage things by  
re-using algorithms, indicating things are identical, etc., but if there  
is no author-observable difference we cannot test it.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then there's the (IMHO) despicable way of just writing a random
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chapter about it and referencing that chapter in the spec wherever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate. Feels very, very wrong, but I don't think we have much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> choice here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see how this is wrong. Since the exact semantics of a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cross-origin request vary per API anyway grouping the common things  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere makes sense to me. (E.g. EventSource would completely fail in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case the resource sharing check fails where as an image would still be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displayed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reading this again the next morning I really should have worded that
</I>&gt;<i> differently. Sorry about that. But I'm really afraid JS developers, in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to catching different behaviours in different UAs would also
</I>&gt;<i> have to deal with different behaviour inside the same UA. Yes, the
</I>&gt;<i> actual use would be different across different cases, but at least the
</I>&gt;<i> raw data would be readable the same way and the parts that implement
</I>&gt;<i> the different uses would have a standardized to where to get their
</I>&gt;<i> data from.
</I>
Consistency is enforced by tests and proper specifications. Currently  
HTML5 has not integrated support for CORS (yet) so it seems a bit early to  
complain :-)
