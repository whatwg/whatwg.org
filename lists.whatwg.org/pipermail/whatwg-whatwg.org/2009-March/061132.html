I don't think anyone is disagreeing with that.


&gt;<i> So, where would you put it? The problem for me is that there's no

</I>&gt;<i> script, link, video, ...) where one could add the necessary

</I>&gt;<i> unrealistic as it would either require reworking the DOM top to bottom
</I>&gt;<i> or including ugly hacks) or adding the necessary attributes to
</I>&gt;<i> HTMLElement itself... which seems like asking for trouble.
</I>
Why does the DOM need to get involved here?


&gt;<i> Then there's the (IMHO) despicable way of just writing a random
</I>&gt;<i> chapter about it and referencing that chapter in the spec wherever
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate. Feels very, very wrong, but I don't think we have much
</I>&gt;<i> choice here.
</I>
I don't see how this is wrong. Since the exact semantics of a cross-origin  
request vary per API anyway grouping the common things somewhere makes  
sense to me. (E.g. EventSource would completely fail in case the resource  
sharing check fails where as an image would still be displayed.)
