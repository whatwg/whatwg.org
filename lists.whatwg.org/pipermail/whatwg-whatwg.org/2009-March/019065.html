SQL storage where the single API call is &quot;run this complex transaction&quot;
might be acceptable.

But if the single API call is &quot;access some shared state&quot; and it's up to Web
developers to deal with locking and synchronization --- that will never be
acceptable. That burden must fall on browser developers, not Web developers.
