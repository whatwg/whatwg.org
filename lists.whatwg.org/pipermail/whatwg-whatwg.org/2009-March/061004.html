If by &quot;compilation&quot; you mean you're (effectively) just doing a syntax  
check then webkit is able to this, although it has a reasonable cost  
associated with it, but then i have a vague hope that the work being  
offloaded onto workers is more substantial than the work the engine is  
putting into parsing.

So in effect, there are 3 steps that mozilla currently takes:
1. for (url in arguments)
         absoluteUrl = resolve(url);
         if (!isValid(absoluteUrl)) throw SYNTAX_ERR
         absoluteUrls.push(absoluteUrl);
2. for (url in absoluteUrls)
         script = loadScript(url)
         if (!isValidSyntax(script))
            throw SYNTAX_ERR;
         scripts.push(script)
3. for (script in scripts)
         execute(script)

While the loads in (2) can be done in parallel, i do not believe that  
the syntax checking can occur in parallel as the syntax error that can  
be thrown represents an observable side effect, and thus load  
completion order could result in different exceptions being thrown  
(syntax error on file2.js vs. file1.js)

In general i think i prefer this model, despite the fact that we end  
up not being able to execute js while waiting for later scripts to  
load, it's seems much more reasonable to give not have side effects if  
any of the resources has a basic non-execution dependent fault.
