</I>&gt;<i> parsing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in effect, there are 3 steps that mozilla currently takes:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. for (url in arguments)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;absoluteUrl = resolve(url);
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;if (!isValid(absoluteUrl)) throw SYNTAX_ERR
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;absoluteUrls.push(absoluteUrl);
</I>&gt;<i> 2. for (url in absoluteUrls)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;script = loadScript(url)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;if (!isValidSyntax(script))
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; throw SYNTAX_ERR;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;scripts.push(script)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. for (script in scripts)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;execute(script)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the loads in (2) can be done in parallel, i do not believe that the
</I>&gt;<i> syntax checking can occur in parallel as the syntax error that can be thrown
</I>&gt;<i> represents an observable side effect, and thus load completion order could
</I>&gt;<i> result in different exceptions being thrown (syntax error on file2.js vs.
</I>&gt;<i> file1.js)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general i think i prefer this model, despite the fact that we end up not
</I>&gt;<i> being able to execute js while waiting for later scripts to load, it's seems
</I>&gt;<i> much more reasonable to give not have side effects if any of the resources
</I>&gt;<i> has a basic non-execution dependent fault.
</I>
Why do you think it's important not to have side effects for syntax
errors but don't think it's important to not have side effects for
run-time errors? Given that we simply can't fix the latter, I don't
see any advantage to users to attempt to fix the former.

I really don't think optimizing for the case when something has gone
wrong is the way to go. That is an extremely rare case in a deployed
application, and so optimizing for performance feels much more
important to users.

Also considering how applications are likely to handle these errors,
I.e. full abort and tell user that an unrecoverable error has
occurred, it doesn't really matter if there have been side effects or
not.
