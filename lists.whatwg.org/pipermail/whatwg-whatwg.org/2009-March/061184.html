<PRE>I agree with Jeremy that the spec is currently unimplementable if we give
localStorage access to workers. I'd like to point out that &quot;workers who want
to access localStorage just need to send a message to their main window&quot;
breaks down for persistent workers (where you don't necessarily have an open
browser window) and is pretty wonky for shared workers (you can send a
message to a window, but that window may go away before your message is
processed, so you end up having to build some kind of &quot;send message,
timeout, pick a new window to send it to, etc&quot; message layer).
One alternative I'd like to propose is to remove access to localStorage for
dedicated workers, and give SharedWorkers access to localStorage, but have
that storage be partitioned by the worker name (i.e. the worker can access
it, but it's not shared with web pages or any other workers and so you don't
have any synchronicity issues). I don't see how this would work for
dedicated workers, though, since there's no name to partition storage
access, but they could always fall back to postMessage().
