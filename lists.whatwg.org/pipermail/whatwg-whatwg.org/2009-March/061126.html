Yes, hence me using the word &quot;aside&quot;...

Anyway, ...


&gt;<i> The Access Control spec is already pretty clear on how
</I>&gt;<i> things are supposed to work on the server and from the server to the
</I>&gt;<i> client and it's probably mostly enough to say that &quot;Image and Video
</I>&gt;<i> elements in addition to cross-origin linking also allow for
</I>&gt;<i> cross-origin use as described in Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&quot;.
</I>
No, currently you actually have to state which algorithm you use in CORS  
and how. Otherwise CORS does not apply (at least not from a specification  
standpoint).


&gt;<i> Me and Chris actually assumed it would work that way until we tried it.
</I>&gt;<i> The main question for me (aside from the question if
</I>&gt;<i> image/video/canvas elements should retain all necessary information to
</I>&gt;<i> check for valid origins that are allowed access again or just be
</I>&gt;<i> marked &quot;standard&quot;/&quot;public&quot;) is where to put it in the spec. It's an
</I>&gt;<i> issue that applies to pretty much anything that allows access to the
</I>&gt;<i> raw data (which is just canvas now, but nobody knows what the future
</I>&gt;<i> will bring) and to make matters worse its nature not only requires
</I>&gt;<i> changes to canvas itself, but also to the elements that are drawable,
</I>&gt;<i> like img or video. So to me it would make the most sense to put this
</I>&gt;<i> as far away as possible from Canvas and make it more into a generic
</I>&gt;<i> item how DOM elements are supposed to hold data about cross origin
</I>&gt;<i> headers. Then the canvas description would need virtually no changed
</I>&gt;<i> beyond &quot;obeys cross-origin rules for pixel access&quot;.
</I>
That does sound nice yes.
