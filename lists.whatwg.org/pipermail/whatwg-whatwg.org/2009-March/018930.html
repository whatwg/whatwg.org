</I>
The problem with synchronously grabbing the lock is that we can only
ever have one feature that uses synchronous locks, otherwise we'll
risk dead-locks.

Say that we make document.cookie behave the same way (to prevent
multi-process browsers like IE8 and chrome from having race
conditions). So that if you call document.getCookiesWithLock(callback)
we'll synchronously grab a lock and call the callback function. This
would cause two pages like the ones below to potentially deadlock:

Page 1:
getLocalStorage(function(storage) {
  document.getCookiesWithLock(function(cookieContainer) {
    storage.foo = cookieContainer.getCookie('cookieName');
  });
]);

Page 2:
document.getCookiesWithLock(function(cookieContainer) {
  getLocalStorage(function(storage) {
    cookieContainer.setCookie('cookieName', storage.bar);
  });
});

The point here isn't to propose a new cookie API, but rather that as
soon as we introduce more than one lock that can be synchronously
acquired, we run the risk of deadlocks if people don't grab them in
the right order.

While we could make the implementation detect this and case the second
page to throw when a deadlock is detected, that just turns the
deadlock into a race condition since pages are unlikely to handle this
exception correctly given that it generally doesn't happen.


By making all lock acquiring async, we ensure that script can only
ever grab one lock at a time, thus preventing people from grabbing
multiple locks in different order and causing deadlocks.


There is actually another alternative. We could specify an order that
locks have to be acquired if you grab more than one. So for example we
could say that the order is

localStore &gt; cookie &gt; otherRandomFeature

In other words, if you want both the localStore and cookie features,
you have to grab first localStore and then cookie. Attempting to grab
localStore once you have acquired the cookie lock *always* results in
an exception being thrown, even if there currently is no deadlock.
Anyone specifying a new feature that uses locking would have to define
where in the locking order this lock is placed. However this API
design does not seem very web developer friendly.
