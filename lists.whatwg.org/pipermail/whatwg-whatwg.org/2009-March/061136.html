</I>
Correct. I'm not a browser maker, so my perspective is probably a bit
different than yours. I just write JS. The problem for me is that if
such data is not available, I would be forced to basically do a lot of
try/catch or other form of error catching just to find out what
exactly I can do when I could just look it up in the elements
attributes.

&gt;&gt;<i> Instead of an UA supporting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first XHR, then image, then video, then XY, the status of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation would be identical in all parts of the UA. Basically,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would force implementations to create the CORS dom support with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common codebase for all elements that use it, instead of having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duplicate code which might behave differently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we should be in the business of enforcing how implementations
</I>&gt;<i> implement things. We can certainly encourage things by re-using algorithms,
</I>&gt;<i> indicating things are identical, etc., but if there is no author-observable
</I>&gt;<i> difference we cannot test it.
</I>
Well, a bit. We do that all the time when we specify inheritance. At
least we encourage it and plant the idea that this really should be in
a common spot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then there's the (IMHO) despicable way of just writing a random
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chapter about it and referencing that chapter in the spec wherever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate. Feels very, very wrong, but I don't think we have much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> choice here.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see how this is wrong. Since the exact semantics of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cross-origin request vary per API anyway grouping the common things
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere makes sense to me. (E.g. EventSource would completely fail in case
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the resource sharing check fails where as an image would still be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> displayed.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reading this again the next morning I really should have worded that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differently. Sorry about that. But I'm really afraid JS developers, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addition to catching different behaviours in different UAs would also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to deal with different behaviour inside the same UA. Yes, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actual use would be different across different cases, but at least the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> raw data would be readable the same way and the parts that implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the different uses would have a standardized to where to get their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consistency is enforced by tests and proper specifications. Currently HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> has not integrated support for CORS (yet) so it seems a bit early to
</I>&gt;<i> complain :-)
</I>
Better now than when the damage is done, right?
