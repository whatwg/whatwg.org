</I>&gt;<i> The current Gecko behavior is that any stylesheet load started by

</I>&gt;<i> again, no more scripts are run until the count goes to 0 again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it doesn't matter how the script is created/inserted, but the only

</I>&gt;<i> DOM, it won't block script execution.  Also, &lt;link&gt; elements pointing to 
</I>&gt;<i> alternate style sheets don't block script execution.
</I>
So testing this:

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/45">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/45</A>

(44 uses currentStyle, for IE/Opera, 45 uses getComputedStyle, for Opera/ 
Firefox/Safari)

It seems Gecko is the only engine that blocks here.

It would be interesting to hear from other browser vendors about their 
opinions on this issue.

</I>
Woah, so this can affect the order of script execution?

That seems very dangerous. What if b() depends on a()? I would be 
surprised if this didn't cause compatibility problems.

</I>
It seems like this is in general an issue that would be best left up to 
the browsers to optimise for, instead of having authors be able to 
micromange this (as Boris put it).

In general, scripts shouldn't depend on style sheets anyway; if you are 
writing code where you want things to be fast, just avoid breaking that 
rule of thumb and then it will never matter.

For the case where you just want scripts to load whenever they are ready 
to load, you can use async=&quot;&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) want to load stylesheets later, (infoPanel example)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Put the styles later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The script blocks the stylesheet.
</I>
The alternative is to just let the browser manage this and load the style 
sheets whenever they want.

 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3) (2), but want to make sure the stylesheet is loaded before the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; script runs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Put the styles first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The stylesheet can be placed right before the script which depends on 
</I>&gt;<i> it, right before closing body tag:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dhtmlkitchen.com/jstest/block/link-script-bottom.html">http://dhtmlkitchen.com/jstest/block/link-script-bottom.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and the result will &quot;work&quot; in Firefox. However, that does not works 
</I>&gt;<i> consistently in a wide enough range of current browsers. Particularly, 
</I>&gt;<i> Webkit and Opera will alert('loaded') before getting the stylesheet.
</I>
Make the script not depend on the style sheet then.


In general, I don't think that this feature request is something that 
really is necessary on the Web. The best way forward is really to just 
design your scripts such that they don't depend on the style sheets (you 
have no guarantee that the user will get the CSS anyway), and then to just 
rely on the browser vendors to make the right decisions about when to 
fetch each file.

</I>&gt;<i> Often when lazy loading a plugin into an web app it is necessary for the

</I>
In general I would recommend against having scripts that depend on 
particular styles.

Since there are already implementations of this I've gone ahead and 
defined it.

</I>
I think long-term our best course of action for this use case is actually 
to have an explicit element that can be used to display dialog boxes, for 
what it's worth.

I haven't added readyState at this time. I am concerned about feature 
creep here.
