I've fixed this (though not quite as you describe, for simplicity's sake).

I fixed this along with the earlier problem.

'play' shouldn't fire, since it was never paused.

'playing' should fire, though, since the readyState will have dropped down 
to HAVE_CURRENT_DATA when the clip is ended, and will drop back up to 
HAVE_FUTURE_DATA after seeking.


&gt;<i> This behaviour seems reasonable if the media element has a loop 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, since playback never really stops (as it restarts immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> upon ending).
</I>
Actually the 'playing' event fires even in this case, which is a bit 
weird. Not sure how to suppress it, though, since if seeking takes 
non-zero time, we shouldn't suppress it after all.

</I>&gt;<i> (ie, buffered, seekable and played)
</I>
With .links, .images, and .frames, what we are returning are objects that 
exist independent of the collections.

This is more like NameList in DOM Level 3 Core, which has:

 list.getName(i);
 list.getNamespaceURI(i);

...instead of:

 list[i].name;
 list[i].namespaceURI;

The reason to do it this way is to avoid having to create one object per 
range (or name/uri pair, in the NameList case). This saves memory and CPU, 
and generally makes things more resilient (e.g. you don't have to worry 
about garbage collecting items from the array separate from the array).

As the spec says:

# In addition to the above, the user agent may provide messages to the 
# user (such as &quot;buffering&quot;, &quot;no video loaded&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, or more detailed 
# information) by overlaying text or icons on the video or other areas of 
# the element's playback area, or in another appropriate manner.

</I>
Consider the program &quot;wget&quot;, which is an HTML user agent. It would not be 
very useful if it showed a link to an external video playback utility.


&gt;<i> Could the language not be updated here to include showing fallback 
</I>&gt;<i> content (along side an alert) when video cannot be found or rendered?
</I>
If the video can't be found, why would the fallback content work better? 
If there are multiple videos, use the &lt;source&gt; element to list them. Once 
we have a standard codec, there should be no reason to ever have a video 
that can't be rendered.

The &lt;source&gt; element provides the fallback.

Once we have a standard codec, that will be how you can guarantee that the 
video will work everywhere.

If the video is removed from the hosting site, then the fallback is 
unlikely to be much use either.

If all you want to show is an error message, the browser should do that.

text/html isn't a video format, and it is not expected that it would be 
supported.

That sounds like a pretty convincing argument for not doing it. :-)

The lack of this feature at this time is intentional. We may add this in 
the future, once the browsers implement what we have now in a reliable 
manner, but in the meantime I recommend using SMIL for this purpose.
