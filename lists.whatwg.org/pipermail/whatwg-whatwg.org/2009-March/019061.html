I have continued to not include cookies in, and have removed localStorage

Wouldn't this run into the same problems?

No (because we don't want to expose the start() method on workers). I've 
made this clear by expliciting saying when the port is opened.

This is the expected behaviour, but there is no race condition; navigation 
happens as part of the event loop, and thus will always happen after the 
script has finished. (Specifically, the &quot;update the session history with 
the new page&quot; algorithm always gets run as a task.)

text/javascript is defined to take a charset parameter.

It does seem reasonable to support non-UTF-8 scripts, given the legacy of

We already have the complexity for scripts, so I don't think it's a huge 
deal. The spec does the same as for &lt;script src&gt; (except for not having an 
inline explicit override like charset=&quot;&quot;).

I think, given text/css, text/html, and text/xml all have character 
encoding declarations inline, transcoding is not going to work in 
practice. I think the better solution would be to remove the rules that 
make text/* an issue in the standards world (it's not an issue in the 
&quot;real&quot; world).

For new formats, though, I think just supporting UTF-8 is a big win.

I think the abuse of application/* for text types has been widly shown to

I figured the use case for setting cookies was to track user preferences 
that the server might need to know about. I'm not sure that makes sense in 
a worker.

Another use case would be keeping track of what has been done so far, for 
this I guess it would make sense to have a localStorage API for shared 
workers (scoped to their name). I haven't added this yet, though.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Gears had an explicit permissions variable applications could check,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Database spec has a strong implication that applications can request

</I>
There are many ways to expose this, e.g. asynchronously as a drop-down 
infobar, or as a pie chart showing the disk usage that the user can click 
on to increase the allocaton whenever they want, etc.


&gt;<i> To be clear, are you saying that our philosophy is to leave any

Both.


&gt;<i> In fact, I'd go further - I don't think we should even *have* names for

Makes sense.


&gt;<i> Also, one of the things I'd like to experiment with in my implementation

True.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Additionally, there's no good way for workers under different

Fixed.


Regarding the suggestion of an explicit yield() that would push a 
continuation of the script onto the task queue, I haven't added this for 
now. I think it's something to bear in mind for implementors; if it 
becomes practical to do this, we should definitely revisit it.

The spec allows implementations to do whatever they want so long as the

It doesn't really allow interruptions, but it allows storage changes... 
I've changed it to navigator.getStorageUpdates().


&gt;<i> It would be possible to use something like getLockedFeatures for workers

The problem with any locks that cross from workers to windows is that 
workers have a tendency to be long-lived, so it would lead to a lot of 
time waiting for locks. I don't think we should make that possible.


&gt;<i> Now, with the storage mutex, are there any cases you know of where 
</I>&gt;<i> serializability fails? If there are, it may be worth noting them in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec. If there aren't, why not simply write serializability into the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec?
</I>
Just writing that something must be true doesn't make it true. :-) I think 
it's safer for us to make the design explicitly enforce this rather than 
say that browser vendors must figure out where it might be broken and 
enforce it themselves.


&gt;<i> When two sets of unrelated browser contexts become related (e.g., C

</I>&gt;<i> by code in another domain which is already related to C), and we can 
</I>&gt;<i> block the join operation in C until one of the two locks is released.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then in your example, suppose C loads A's document first. Then C's lock

</I>&gt;<i> merged to make the DB-lock. Now suppose C loads B. The two remaining 
</I>&gt;<i> locks are merged to form a single CADB-lock. No deadlock is possible.
</I>
Yes, if we have one lock per group consisting of the transitive closure of 
all origins and browsing contexts related by origin or by a unit of 
related browsing contexts, then we could make any navigation that would 
cause two groups to be joined to also need to grab the lock of the other 
group before navigating. I'm not going to mention that in the spec, 
though; I'll leave that up to browser vendors to implement as an 
optimisation if they think it's worth it.


&gt;<i> &gt; If it can be shown that it is not ever possible for script in one

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure why synchronous invocation across origins matters.
</I>
Because it would enable a deadlock to occur. If origin A's lock is owned 
by some window 1, and in window 2, a script in origin B gets its lock and 
then synchronously calls a script in origin A which then tries to get its 
lock, and then the script from origin A in window 1 synchronously calls a 
script in origin B which then tries to get its lock, you'll have deadlock.

Setting cookies that are visible cross-domain might be one such 
mechanism, as mentioned by Drew:

I suppose it would be bad to lock everyone when an alert is up, so I've 
made all the modal dialog features release the lock.

Sync XHR should also release the lock, and then grab it again to set 
cookies and rerelease it. I've contacted the XHR editor about this.

I think it makes sense to treat dedicated workers as simple subresources, 
not separate browsing contexts, and that they should thus just use the 
application cache of their parent browsing contexts. This is what WebKit 
does, according to ap.

I've now done this in the spec.


For shared workers, I see these options:

 - Not allow app caches, so shared workers don't work when offline. That 
   seems bad.

 - Same as suggested for dedicated workers above -- use the creator's 
   cache, so at least one client will get the version they expect. Other 
   clients will have no idea what version they're talking to, the creator 
   would have an unusual relationship with the worker (it would be able 
   to call swapCache() but nobody else would), and once the creator goes 
   away, there will be a zombie relationship.

 - Pick an appcache more or less at random, like when you view an image in 
   a top-level browsing context. Clients will have no idea which version 
   they're talking to.

 - Allow workers to specify a manifest using some sort of comment syntax.
   Nobody knows what version they'll get, but at least it's always the 
   same version, and it's always up to date.

Using the creator's cache is the one that minimises the number of clients 
that are confused, but it also makes the debugging experience most differ 
from the case where there are two apps using the worker.

Using an appcache selected the same way we would pick one for images has 
the minor benefit of being somewhat consistent with how window.open() 
works, and we could say that window.open() and new SharedWorker are 
somewhat similar.

I have picked this route for now. Implementation feedback is welcome in 
determining if this is a good idea.
