Not just on mobile devices. Desktop browsers can also offer  
integration with the system Address Book, and to some extent do this  
already based on heuristics that guess which input fields are for  
phone numbers. I believe every major browser has heuristics like this.  
Having an unambiguous way to indicate that a field expects a phone  
number would allow for better integration. It would eliminate false  
negatives, since phone number fields may be missed if they don't use a  
name=&quot;&quot; that enables the browser to guess. And by eliminating false  
positives, it would make it practical to make more extensive changes  
to the field, such as actually replacing it with a pop-up to choose  
phone numbers for example.

While I sympathize with the desire to see current HTML5 form controls  
implemented first, frankly, we would be more interested in  
implementing &lt;input type=&quot;tel&quot;&gt; than the six different date/time  
controls currently in HTML5. It seems to me that entering a phone  
number is much more common than entering any kind of date at all, and  
certainly more common than entering a month or a week.
