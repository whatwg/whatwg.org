Microsoft did. And nothing changed in well over a year. (They say so in a  
comment on the blog post.)

Opera was the first doing this and we hit a few issues as well so we  
decided to go with a simple prefix (C:\fake_path\ changed to C:\fakepath\  
now per discussion with Microsoft). It looks a bit ugly, but it's not at  
all the issue that same make it out to be I think. (E.g. the initial email  
claimed this inconsistency between the DOM and HTTP would cause issues for  
Web application developers...) Furthermore, once we get interoperable  
support for &lt;input type=file multiple&gt; and the fileList proposal starts  
moving we can provide cleaner access directly to the file name there.
