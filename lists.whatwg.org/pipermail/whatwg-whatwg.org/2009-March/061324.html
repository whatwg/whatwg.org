Again... its not just workers that are affected by this... speaking as
someone
that works on a multi-threaded browser, this is troubling. If its possible
to
spec features that allow script to poke at the world beyond the page
boundaries in a fashion that doesn't not require locking semantics beyond
the scope of a single scriptable API call... that would be less troubling.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One alternative I'd like to propose is to remove access to localStorage

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can access it, but it's not shared with web pages or any other workers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and so you don't have any synchronicity issues).

</I>

I think there's some additional low-hanging fruit too. We're toying with
two,
independent axis: lifetime vs accessScope.

  'sessionStorage' has sessionOnlyLifetime and tabSpecificScope
  'localStorage' has persistentLifetime and browserWideScope

In this nomenclature, the new idea could be phrased as...

  'page/workerStorage' has persistentLifetime and page/workerSpecificScope

Other slots in the matrix formed by these two axis could make sense...

  sessionLifetime + page/workerSpecificScope
  sessionLifetime + browserWideScope

sessionLifetime + tabSpecificScope doesn't make much sense since
you get a new set of tabs when starting a new session

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lifetime short. So we can block while we wait for it to become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available. This is just like the behavior today without workers.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if javascript in another window, running in another thread or

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; context B if a script running in context A can affect the execution of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an already-running script in context B. Use one lock per subset, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a script execution acquire the lock when it first touches
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; localStorage or cookies, and drop the lock when it completes (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yields). Additional optimizations are possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've updated the spec to require the locking mechanism that was in place

</I>&gt;<i> block all other windows that try to use cookies, though, so I've also
</I>&gt;<i> added navigator.releaseLock() which can be called to explicitly release
</I>&gt;<i> the lock that is put in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User agents that share event loops between origins can't actually have any
</I>&gt;<i> more than one lock total. Consider a case where there are three windows
</I>&gt;<i> from three different origins, A, B, and C, where C contains a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;iframe&gt;s, and where A, B, and C are independent, but C share an event
</I>&gt;<i> loop with whatever content is in its iframes. (This is the situation
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome and IE are in, as I understand it, with event loops being
</I>&gt;<i> per-window not per-origin, and it may be required because access to the
</I>&gt;<i> frames[] hierarchy is synchronous.) Now, assume A and B have both obtained
</I>&gt;<i> their respective locks, and are busy doing some long script. C is free to
</I>&gt;<i> run more tasks from its event loop, which could include navigating one
</I>&gt;<i> iframe to a page on either A and the other iframe to a page on B, meaning
</I>&gt;<i> that the event loop of C is now beholden to two locks. If there is any
</I>&gt;<i> manner in which to synchronously cause another origin to run script, this
</I>&gt;<i> now means that C can attempt to obtain both locks; if we now imagine
</I>&gt;<i> another window just like C that instead obtains the locks in the reverse
</I>&gt;<i> order, we get deadlock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it can be shown that it is not ever possible for script in one origin
