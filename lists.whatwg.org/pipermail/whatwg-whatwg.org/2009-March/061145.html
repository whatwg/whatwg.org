</I>&gt;<i> Hi Tom.  I'd like you to clarify an aspect of your proposal:
</I>

Please don't see this as a proposal, but rather as a compilation of the
things people seem to have agreed on so far. My intention was to compile in
one post what has been discussed in several posts lately. I thought it would
be easier to discuss the topic as a whole, but of course we will discuss
each items separately where we do not agree.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;time&gt;2009-03-16&lt;/time&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Printing directly on the page, no tool tip: &quot;March 16, 2009&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the author wrote a date in ISO 8601 format, a browser should
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite it the user's local date format, such that it is
</I>&gt;<i> indistinguishable from if the author had typed it that way in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Obviously pre-HTML-5 browsers will still display the raw 2009-03-16.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose I'm a UK user who happens to've configured my computer's date
</I>&gt;<i> format to DD/MM/YYYY (which is common over here) and I see an American
</I>&gt;<i> conference's website American give its date as 04/07/2009.  I know that
</I>&gt;<i> the USA date order is different from the UK's, so I'm used to having to
</I>&gt;<i> remember to read that as April 7th.  You're suggesting that there should
</I>&gt;<i> be two possibilities I have to take into account:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The author literally wrote &quot;04/07/2009&quot;, and the conference is on April
</I>&gt;<i>  7th.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The author literally wrote &lt;time&gt;2009-07-04&lt;/time&gt;, my browser
</I>&gt;<i>  converted that to my local format and displayed it as 04/07/2009, and
</I>&gt;<i>  the conference is on July 4th
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that as a reader I can't tell which of these it is, without viewing
</I>&gt;<i> the document's source?  (And even to spot that there is an ambiguity
</I>&gt;<i> I've got to be aware that my browser 'sometimes' changes dates, that it
</I>&gt;<i> depends on my computer's configuration, and what config I picked.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the same apply to times?  Would they also be converted to the
</I>&gt;<i> user's local timezone?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;time&gt;16 mars 2009&lt;/time&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The user agent could, but is not required to, make an effort to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpret the date and do whatever it likes with it. However, if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; date provided cannot be interpreted as ISO 8601 it could simply print
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the content as is without any change. In this example, if the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agent is able to understand this French date, the tool tip could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;March 16, 2009&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a browser interprets a date in a different format, the localized
</I>&gt;<i> version goes in the tooltip but the user sees exactly what the author
</I>&gt;<i> typed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is, which version (author-written or localized) the browser shows
</I>&gt;<i> in the page depends on which format the author used?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Smylers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I totally agree with you. That is something I haven't foreseen. I would go
with your proposal.

&lt;time&gt;2009-03-15&lt;/time&gt;
&quot;2009-03-15&quot; is displayed unaltered on the page, and the tooltip shows a
representation as set in my preferences, such as &quot;March 15, 2009&quot;. If the
content cannot be interpreted by the user agent, then no tooltip is
displayed at all. (Of course a tooltip is a suggested mechanism, a user
agent could use another method.)
