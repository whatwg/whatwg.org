<PRE>
Over the past month or so I have collected about 142 e-mails on the topic 
of the &lt;time&gt; element and other time-related subjects. This is an attempt 
to address that feedback.

I have attempted below to reply to all the substantial feedback in these 
threads. I have intentionally ignored e-mails and parts of e-mails that 
repeated points made in earlier e-mails, that made claims from authority, 
and e-mails that did not start from the basis of use cases, demonstrated 
needs, and logical argumentation. I have also ignored proposals that were 
explicitly put forward with the caveat that they did not fix problems that 
we need to fix. If you feel I have missed a point that should affect the 
specification, please let me know.

Also, a reminder: please do not cross-post e-mails to both the WHATWG list 
and the public-html list. Since the WHATWG list bounces e-mails from 
non-subscribers, cross-posting will lead to the thread being fragmented, 
with some people only seeing some parts of the discussion. Please feel 
free to pick one list or the other when commenting on HTML5, but avoid 
cross-posting. Thanks!

</I>
I don't agree with the conditional there. We can improve matters even if 
we only address a small number of cases relative to the total number of 
potential uses.

In particular, HTML5 is explicitly being designed with the goal of only 
attempting to address common use cases, leaving the rarely-relevant cases 
unaddressed. We call this the 80/20 rule: Only 80% of use cases (by usage) 
are addressed, leaving the remaining 20% for future versions.


&gt;<i> hCalendar microformats are already used to mark up imprecise dates 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;June 1977&quot;; &quot;2009&quot;). ISO8601 already supports them. Why not HTML5?
</I>
HTML5 does support them. Here is how you can write June 1977 in HTML:

   &lt;p&gt;I was married in June 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is how you can refer to a year:

   &lt;p&gt;The operating system was released in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

The primary use cases for &lt;time&gt; are:

 * The ability to encode 80% of dates and times in a machine-readable way 
   so that the user can make use of them in an automated fashion, in 
   particular for adding dates to a calendar.

 * The ability to restyle dates that contain a &quot;day&quot; component so that 
   they follow user conventions (2000-12-31 vs 31-12-2000 vs 12-31-2000).

 * The ability to encode the output of &lt;input type=date&gt; and &lt;input 
   type=time&gt; in an unambiguous fashion, for styling.

None of these require that &lt;time&gt; be able to express years or year-month 
pairs; what are the use cases that we should address that need &lt;time&gt; to 
support these formats?


&gt;<i> [non-Gregorian dates]
</I>&gt;<i> [dates before 1CE]
</I>
It isn't clear that either of these are needed to address the above use 
cases either.


&gt;<i> Another abuse of ABBR in microformats for coordinates:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;abbr class=&quot;geo&quot; title=&quot;52.548;-1.932&quot;&gt;Great Barr&lt;/abbr&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...] this could be resolved, and HTML5 usefully extended, by a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;location&quot; element:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;location latitude=&quot;52.548&quot; longitude=&quot;-1.932&quot;&gt;Great
</I>&gt;<i>         Barr&lt;/location&gt;
</I>
It isn't clear what use case this addresses. Is this for use with mapping 
applications? Wouldn't a new protocol be a better way of addressing this, 
e.g.:

   &lt;a href=&quot;latlong:52.548;-1.932&quot;&gt;Great Barr&lt;/a&gt;

...where applications like Google Earth could register for latlong:?


&gt;<i> Now all we need to do is to work-around the abuse of ABBR for durations, 
</I>&gt;<i> in the draft hAudio microformat:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;abbr title=&quot;PT3M23S&quot;&gt;3 minutes 23 seconds&lt;/abbr&gt;
</I>
Surely that should be:

   &lt;abbr title=&quot;3 minutes 23 seconds&quot;&gt;PT3M23S&lt;/abbr&gt;

Anyway, I expect that whatever solution we come up with for RDFa will 
address this particular issue.

I encourage you to read our FAQ, in particular the part on how to propose 
features:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F</A>

We would need use cases that are much more concrete than &quot;automated 
conversion, sorting, etc&quot;. Showing existing non-demo software that works 
around the problem (e.g. using a microformat) is a good way to demonstrate 
a use case.

New features will be added -- either to HTML5, or HTML6, or later -- as

Why would they need to mark up they date, if they don't know it exactly?

Surely this is fine:

   &lt;p&gt;Dad was born on &lt;time&gt;1911-01-01&lt;/time&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mum was born sometime in February 1911.&lt;/p&gt;

What use case does this not address?

HTML isn't a database format. If you want to do things like locate 
relatives, HTML isn't going to help you. Use GEDCOM or some such system.

I don't see how the &lt;time&gt; element has anything to do with this. Surely 
when you search a database, you would look at the actual database, not the 
HTML files.

Why? How would marking these dates up be useful? Surely any data mining on

It can be used (thought might not always be particularly useful) for any

1894 would work fine; 1665 would require careful conversion from the 
Julian calendar. A blog supposedly from 100BCE couldn't be marked up.

In practice these are edge cases. We're not trying to solve every problem;

</I>
That rather depends on the data type that $t uses. Regardless of what we 
allow, there will always be date/time data types that can't be expressed. 
For example, if the data type allows minutes to be marked as unknown, an 
we require hour-minute times. Similarly, if we allow arbitrary years, then 
we might underflow the underlying data type. Allowing 1..Inf keeps the 
syntax simple.

Note that not allowing any dates before the 1700s is pretty silly, because 
the calendar existed before then, and allowing dates before the 1500s is 
pretty silly also, since it didn't exist before then. Converting to and 
from contemporary dates to Gregorian is not at all obvious. The only 
reason the spec doesn't disallow dates before the Gregorian calendar is 
that the Gregorian calendar started at different times in different 
countries, and just allowing anything from 1 seemed easier than trying to 
find a minimum value and defining a reference country for interpreting 
dates around then, etc.

Why wouldn't just searching for &quot;1595&quot;, with no markup involved, be good

The use cases are why the feature is there, they're not a limit on people

&gt;<i> What it does limit is the format: no &quot;fuzzy dates&quot; like &quot;July 1897&quot; for

</I>
The latter can be given, if you convert from Julian to Gregorian. 
0814-01-28 is probably not the right date; you'd probably want 0814-02-01 
if I'm doing my maths right. The problem is that this is confusing, and 
people aren't going to know. If you tell someone &quot;January 28 814&quot; they 
don't think you mean February. If someone encodes that date using &lt;time&gt;, 
they'll almost certainly get it wrong.

Allowing dates before Gregorian is bad enough, but if we go back even 
further we're just asking for trouble.

You can use any date in the Gregorian calendar, as well as any date up to 
1AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. I'm not sure where you saw a 1970 
limit; could you point to that part of the spec so it can be fixed?

Exposing Gregorian dates for time before the Gregorian calendar existed 
is ridiculous, IMHO; it's allowed only because finding a start date for 
the Gregorian calendar is non-trivial and harder than just saying &quot;1&quot;.

Introducing negative numbers is non-trivial extra complexity; what does it 
get us? What are the actual concrete use cases? Is there software that 
does something with documents that would actually want proleptic Gregorian 
calendar dates?

It's worth noting Wikipedia's comment on the matter: &quot;this proleptic 
calendar should be used with great caution&quot;. It's also worth noting that 
ISO8601 uses astronomical year numbering which differs from the 
traditional proleptic Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar. Thus, 
March 3rd 1BC (Julian) would be 0000-03-01 in ISO8601 (two days &quot;earlier&quot; 
and in a different year!). The chances of authors actually getting this 
kind of thing right are so remote that I really don't see any value in 
actually allowing it. There's no point having machine-readable dates if 
all the dates are wrong.


&gt;<i> Supporting ranges seems to have a strong case for inclusion based on the

hCalendar seems to handle this fine with &lt;time&gt; (as per the example in the

It doesn't avoid the complexity of pre-Gregorian dates, sadly. Greece only 
started using the Gregorian calendar in 1923, so there are probably still 
people alive who, if they mark up their date naively using &lt;time&gt;, will 
end up encoding it wrongly (i.e. as a proleptic Gregorian date that 
doesn't match the actual date they were born on). So if we are to avoid 
dates that could be confused with non-Gregorian dates, we should use 
disallow dates before 1 March 1923. But that's not really practical, since 
there are many people who will want to mark up dates from the 19th and 
early 20th century and who have really no reason not to do so, since the 
calendar was adopted in their country long before 1923.

This is why I just went with 1AD as the first allowed year.

Done.

Actually the spec does say that documents must be valid. That's what it 
means to define &quot;valid&quot;. By definition, things that are not valid are 
wrong, and thus must not be done.

For experts, sure, but most people aren't going to get it right. Most 
people don't know that the calendar changed subtly in the past few 
centuries.

Why would we force authors to encode the dates in HTML at all? I really 
don't understand why anyone would use &lt;time&gt; for such dates.

HTML5 right now allows years from 1 to Infinity, which seems to be in line 
with what you are saying.
