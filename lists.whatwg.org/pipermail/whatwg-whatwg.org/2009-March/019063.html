Null and empty string should, imo, have the same behavior here.  It 
doesn't make sense to treat them differently to me.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are big scary comments in the Gecko code for these setters saying

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a serious web compat issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this Gecko-internal code you're referring to? Or the setters exposed to web content via HTMLAnchorElement?
</I>
The latter.  The Gecko-internal URI code does in fact throw on a lot of 
these setters, and the HTMLAnchorElement methods catch and eat these 
exceptions, very much on purpose.

&gt;<i> And do you have any examples of websites that would break if they threw?
</I>
Not offhand; I know I've seen sites setting hostnames on various 
non-http URIs, though (just as part of dealing with other, unrelated, 
bugs)...  That would become an uncaught exception with your proposal.

&gt;&gt;<i> Changing from an authority to a non-authority URI or the other way 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around doesn't seem desirable to me (and would only work for unknown 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schemes anyway, presumably, at best; it's better if it just never works).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does it matter? Since it's an unknown scheme, it's basically opaque data. You can't dereference it and fetch the resource it points to
</I>
No, but you can pass it off to a helper application.  In any case, my 
comment above was more concerned with your proposal that one should be 
able to create a non-authority http: URI than about unknown schemes.

&gt;&gt;<i> That's nice, but I suspect web sites rely on the silent fail behavior here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Examples?
</I>
If I see some, I'll let you know.  Looking through the web for them (or 
through bugzilla for that matter) is not really a priority for me right 
now, sorry.
