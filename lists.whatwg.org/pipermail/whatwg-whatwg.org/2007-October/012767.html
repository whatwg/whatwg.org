My problem with the above was primarily that changeVersion was  
synchronous, which is what made it &quot;nonsensical&quot;.  Now that it's  
async, I understand completely.  However...

I share Maciej's concern here.  Right now the only alternative is to  
make sure you're not in the middle of any transactions, perform an  
executeSql() chain in one transaction that changes the database  
schema, and immediately follow up that chain with a changeVersion().   
Problem is that another browsing context can still butt-in between  
your schema-mutating-transaction and your call to changeVersion().   
What if that other browsing context changes the schema in a different  
way, then you change the version, but not to what you would expect?

I think there is a legitimate need to make sure a changeVersion() is  
associated with a specific transaction such that when that transaction  
is complete and committed, the version change is attached as part of it.
