I'd rather keep the API as thin as possible.

If something becomes the de-facto standard, we can add it to the spec's 
SQL dialect when we come around to defining it.

</I>
Well, eventually we're going to have to define the exact SQL dialect we 
require, and that's going to constrain what backends implementors can use 
anyway.

Indeed.

I don't think we should necessarily optimise the API for that case! :-)

Those are UA-specific, and can use UA-specific extensions.

Right. Ideally, SQLite and other backends used for this feature would 
follow the standard. That would be the best solution from the HTML5 spec's 
point of view.
