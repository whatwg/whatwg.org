</I>&gt;<i> VCR or YouTube screen?&quot;
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   For &lt;audio&gt; in general, there's been very little demand for &lt;audio&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   other than from people suggesting that it makes abstract logical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sense
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree. It's been pointed out by multiple people that &lt;video&gt; will 
</I>&gt;<i> be used for audio. That could be quite likely if the page authors wants 
</I>&gt;<i> to send ogg vorbis audio.
</I>
We have &lt;audio&gt; now.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * What's the use case for hasAudio or hasVideo? Wouldn't the author
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   ahead of time whether the content has audio or video?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That depends. If you are displaying one fixed piece of media, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure. If you are displaying general user-selectable content...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This reasoning seems sound to me. In general, I am weary of proposals 
</I>&gt;<i> that require control over both sides of the wire to be effective.
</I>
Right now you can tell if you have video content by checking the 
videoWidth and videoHeight attributes. There is no equivalent for audio.


&gt;<i> &gt; We have included a mechanism for static fallback based on container 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type and codec, so that it's possible to choose the best video format 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a client even if user agent codec support varies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What existing markup leads us to believe this will be an effective 
</I>&gt;<i> method for content negotiation?
</I>
&lt;source&gt; gets around this by moving the selection to the client.

</I>&gt;<i> To me, the distinction between the &lt;audio&gt; element and the Audio object

</I>&gt;<i> content logically belongs, while the former is more of a global trigger 
</I>&gt;<i> for web application sound effects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;audio&gt; could, for example, be rendered in-line with surrounding text in 
</I>&gt;<i> an aural browser. A visual browser would presumably provide some kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> representation in the document of the audio which the user can interact 
</I>&gt;<i> with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, &lt;audio&gt; should be like &lt;img&gt; for sound.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, what the visual representation of &lt;audio&gt; should be is not an 
</I>&gt;<i> easy decision. It's even harder than &lt;video&gt;, because there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> inherent visual content to overlay a UI on top of.
</I>
I have tried to make the spec reflect this.

Yes, this is what the spec now says.


&gt;<i> I think &lt;audio&gt; is useful for foreground/semantic audio, as opposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> purely presentational sound effects, because non-browser tools analyzing 
</I>&gt;<i> a document would have a harder time finding audio referenced only from 
</I>&gt;<i> script. (Imagine a most-linked MP3s on the web feature in a search 
</I>&gt;<i> engine.)
</I>
Maybe.


&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, what the visual representation of &lt;audio&gt; should be is not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an easy decision. It's even harder than &lt;video&gt;, because there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inherent visual content to overlay a UI on top of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be no visual representation by default with no 
</I>&gt;<i> controller, and just controls otherwise.
</I>
That's what the spec now says, I believe.
