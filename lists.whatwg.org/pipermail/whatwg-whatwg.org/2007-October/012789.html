</I>
Ok... but why can't the software simply avoid corrupting the database in 
the first place?

We don't have error codes for &quot;the DOM has become corrupted&quot; or for &quot;the 
Window object's properties have become corrupted&quot;, why do we need one for 
&quot;the Database's contents are corrupted&quot;? Why can't the database contents 
simply not be corrupted in the first place?

As I see it there are two ways the database could get corrupted -- 
software error (bugs, spec-wise illegal behavious) and uncontrollable 
external factors (cosmic rays, hardware failure, overheating, the user 
hexediting the database file...).

The uncontrollable external factors can affect _anything_. The DOM could 
get corrupted in RAM by cosmic rays while the browser is running. A chip 
could overheat and return bogus data randomly for a canvas getPixelData() 
call. The drive could intermittently fail, preventing the cookies from 
being read completely. We don't have any sort of handling for _any_ of 
these problems right now, and I don't see why the database would be a 
special case. If we want to handle these problems, we should find a 
generic solution, IMHO (though it might involve errorCode values for the 
Database object as well).

So this leaves the software error case. Specifying what should happen in 
the case of a software error seems to be about as pointless as regulating 
how outlaws should behave. By definition, the rules aren't being followed 
-- how can we provide rules to decide how things work?


&gt;<i> How the user agent handles the problem long term (ask the user what to 
</I>&gt;<i> do, silently delete and recreate it, let the database continue to be 
</I>&gt;<i> corrupt, etc) may not need to be specified, but perhaps it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> prudent to change the spec to at least suggest that if a database 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes &quot;known to be corrupt,&quot; operations on all open handles to that 
</I>&gt;<i> database should start throwing INVALID_STATE_ERR exceptions.
</I>
I think it would be reasonable for the UA to start raising UA-specific 
exceptions in this case, but I don't see why it's any different than the 
UA detecting that the network stack is corrupted and raising exceptions 
on calls to XMLHttpRequest.

</I>
But what if the catastrophic failure was that the Window object's 
properties got wiped? Should we fire an event for that case and let the 
script repopulate the Window object from the database?

I guess I just don't understand the expected scenarios where failure is to 
occur in such a localised case as to make this useful.

I'm also trying to read very specifically into what you're saying, since I 
have to write very specifically into the spec. :-)


&gt;<i> Let me take a step back and try to frame it at a higher level

</I>&gt;<i> the database unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> - Some action is taken to reset the database so that it is usable - lets
</I>&gt;<i> pretend the resolution is always recreating an empty database from scratch
</I>&gt;<i> - The script knows something wrong happened - it has a completely 100% generic
</I>&gt;<i> error on its query.  But it is unaware of the nature of this event and its
</I>&gt;<i> resolution.  It decides to execute a new sql statement, and the value of this
</I>&gt;<i> statement (from the script's perspective) is reliant on previously established
</I>&gt;<i> values in the database.  The statement coincidentally succeeds even with the
</I>&gt;<i> new empty database.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For further argument, lets pretend the script is in an onunload handler and
</I>&gt;<i> its writing some small piece of data out to the database before the user
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;quits&quot;.  It has a lot of other data in memory client-side that it *thinks* is
</I>&gt;<i> in the database, but really isn't anymore.  It *could* write this data out,
</I>&gt;<i> preserving a lot of important user state.  But it doesn't know to do so.
</I>
Are we seriously expecting authors to check for the extremely unlikely 
case of the database getting corrupted during their onunload, just so that 
they can try the long shot of writing everything back to the database 
again and hope it works?


&gt;<i> One can certainly make the argument that if this were a native application
</I>&gt;<i> saving data to disk, it would be prudent to verify its data on disk.
</I>
Would it? I would imagine an application doing this would really just be 
checking the contents of the disk cache (and probably at the OS level, 
not even the disk's own internal cache).

I would imagine the same applies here, actually.


&gt;<i> But I think &quot;raw filesystem&quot; and &quot;database&quot; are different paradigms with 
</I>&gt;<i> different usage expectations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An error code along the lines of &quot;your database was just reset&quot; might 
</I>&gt;<i> fit the bill.  This could be because of corruption, because the user 
</I>&gt;<i> agent database management was invoked and the database cleared, or a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of other reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a requested split from code 1 - &quot;The statement failed for 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons not covered by any other code.&quot;
</I>
I think this would be an event, not an error code.

Which point?

</I>
I can't really advise you from a UI point of view. I'm not sure what your 
questions imply regarding the spec, though.

I agree.
