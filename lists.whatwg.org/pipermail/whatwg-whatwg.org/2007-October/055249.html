Agreed.

I have dropped the concept of significant inline content, replacing it 
with a blanket &quot;should&quot; statement, which will probably need to be cleaned 
up in due course.


&gt;<i> To make document conformance a more useful concept for the purpose of catching
</I>&gt;<i> author errors, I suggest that the following attributes be made required:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> href and rel on link
</I>
Done.

&gt;<i> href on base
</I>
Done (unless target is there instead).

&gt;<i> name and content on meta (other than the encoding decl)
</I>
Exactly one of name, http-equiv, and charset must be present, and content 
must be present if name or http-equiv is present.

&gt;<i> src on img
</I>
Done.

&gt;<i> code, height and width on applet
</I>
These are not the attributes you are looking for.

&gt;<i> name and value on param
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> To allow user agents see whether the author provided the empty string as 
</I>&gt;<i> the alternative text of whether the author just didn't care, I suggest 
</I>&gt;<i> that the alt attribute on img be made optional. The above-mentioned 
</I>&gt;<i> elements are useless without the listed attributes. The img element is 
</I>&gt;<i> not useless without alt, so editors have an incentive to allow authors 
</I>&gt;<i> to insert img elements without alternative text but do not have an 
</I>&gt;<i> incentive to allow useless link elements, for example.
</I>
alt=&quot;&quot; is now optional.


&gt;<i> Since sectional elements are document-oriented rather than Web 
</I>&gt;<i> application-oriented, it seems to me it would make sense to require them 
</I>&gt;<i> to contain one or more block elements as opposed to zero or more.
</I>
They SHOULD not be empty but it's not a MUST.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, I have doubts about the requirement of significant 
</I>&gt;<i> inline content. When the W3C said that paragraphs mustn't be empty, 
</I>&gt;<i> various applications started emitting &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;. If the WHAT WG says 
</I>&gt;<i> that paragraphs must contend significant inline content, are the 
</I>&gt;<i> developers of those applications suddenly going to decide not to allow 
</I>&gt;<i> them to paragraphs to be saved or are they going to come up with an even 
</I>&gt;<i> more crufty work-around to comply with the machine-checkable 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements of the spec?
</I>
I'm convinced; gone is that MUST requirement. (It should probably still 
give warnings in a lint-level conformance checker, though.)

</I>
Agreed on those.


&gt;<i> &gt;  * It should be possible to have a group of pages that have a similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    structure, with elements annotated as necessary. For example, a menu
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    list could be the same on each page, but with the currently loaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    page simply not having the &quot;href&quot; attribute on its link, or some such.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I suppose an &lt;a&gt; without a href could make sense for styling in 
</I>&gt;<i> such a case. Still seems wrong somehow.
</I>
I don't really see why &lt;a&gt; without href=&quot;&quot; is wrong, especially given the 
strong use case of having a placeholder in menu structures.


&gt;<i> &gt;  * It should always be clear from a semantic point of view whether the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    content is a single &quot;paragraph&quot;, or whether it is a group of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    paragraphs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, changing flow to exclusive or of block and inline seems reasonable.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> &gt; Exceptions: &lt;base target&gt; may mean that &lt;base&gt; should have either href 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or target.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current draft does not even have target. How would the target map to 
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML where the base element is not allowed?
</I>
&lt;base target&gt;.

All three of these questions are now inapplicable.
