Scripts can actually still run fine even if you navigate away from a 
page. But there are definitely weird things happening (such as global 
scope being different from 'window').

This isn't the thread to discuss this though.

</I>
Are you referring to &quot;When a media element is actively playing and its 
owner Document is an active document, its current playback position must 
increase monotonically at playbackRate units of media time per unit time 
of wall clock time&quot;?

First of all, that'll mean that calling .play() on a 
in-non-active-document element will silently fail. It'd probably be 
better to throw an exception.

It's also something that's easier to miss for an implementor. Might be a 
good idea to put it in the steps for play() and change the 
removed-from-document paragraph to say:

When a media element is removed from a Document, or the .ownerDocument 
stops being an active document, the user agent must act as if the 
pause() method had been invoked.
