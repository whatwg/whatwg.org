My feeling now isn't really different from my feeling when you originally

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd basically agree.  Which perhaps makes the argument stronger -- I

</I>&gt;<i> method=&quot;post&quot; offers a path to get people to move in the right 
</I>&gt;<i> direction.  Some of the motivations for using anchors is removed by Web 
</I>&gt;<i> Forms, but not entirely.
</I>
Given that you can now easily make a submit button without a form, it 
would be interesting to see if this reduces the demand for this:

&gt;<i> It's not 100% clear to me how you'd do the equivalent with &lt;button&gt;.  I

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;button form=&quot;delete&quot; name=&quot;delete&quot; value=&quot;10&quot;&gt;delete this&lt;/button&gt;
</I>
Actually it's simpler. You can just do:

   &lt;button action=form method=post name=delete value=10&gt;delete this&lt;/button&gt;

No need for a form.


&gt;<i> And that's not too bad.  If you really didn't want it to look like a 
</I>&gt;<i> button, you could go out of your way to use CSS to do that.  If the UA

</I>&gt;<i> buttons not being used (besides currently requiring Javascript) is that 
</I>&gt;<i> they don't look very nice in long lists, so control over appearance is 
</I>&gt;<i> important.  But using anchors for actions is so engrained in web 
</I>&gt;<i> developers that it might not be enough of a carrot.
</I>
It's hard to know... testing it (by having browsers support the above and 
then seeing if authors adapt over the following years) would be a good 
test, I think.


&gt;<i> &gt; But having said that, a lot of people have asked for this kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing. Should we give up on our ideals in this particular case and

I mean, act like a link but do a button's work.

Ironically, nofollow doesn't really mean that it shouldn't be followed, 
just that the linking site doesn't endorse it (e.g. because the link was 
added by untrusted users).

But yes, we could maybe address this by adding new rel types... it's just 
unclear to me that Web authors who are writing pages that have 
side-effects in response to GET are going to be savvy enough to use the 
new rel types.

Yeah, you can have a separate form that does this too.


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that using a link for this is somewhat of a hack:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;form?delete=10&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;delete this&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're making the submission URI a magic string, which is suboptimal at

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;form&quot; body=&quot;delete=10&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;delete this&lt;/a&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hrm... thinking it out, it does become less appealing.  The first is

</I>
True.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But one major reasons for buttons not being used (besides currently 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; requiring Javascript) is that they don't look very nice in long 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lists, so control over appearance is important.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How does this work in native UIs? People don't use links there. Why is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this different?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Native UIs are very different from web pages.  Maybe it's just different 
</I>&gt;<i> expectations, since web pages are far more stylable than most all 
</I>&gt;<i> toolkits. Maybe it's that there's no custom widgets and so links are 
</I>&gt;<i> used for things that in native UIs that often work very differently.
</I>
Native UIs have links these days. They just don't use them for things like 
&quot;delete by data&quot;. I don't see why Web UI should be different.


&gt;<i> For instance, in a native UI you'd usually select the item and hit a 
</I>&gt;<i> delete button.  But this kind of selection isn't typically feasible in a 
</I>&gt;<i> web page.
</I>
We're trying to change that though, e.g. with &lt;datagrid&gt;.


&gt;<i> There's also a question of visual weight.  Things in a native UI are 
</I>&gt;<i> hidden behind menus and dialogs.  Navigation in a web application is 
</I>&gt;<i> typically more transparent, with far less interstitial dialogs.  For 
</I>&gt;<i> instance, I wouldn't put a &quot;logout&quot; link as a button, even though it has 
</I>&gt;<i> a side effect; I'd consider the button distracting.  (A fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> danger-free side effect, but a side effect nonetheless.)  Buttons direct 
</I>&gt;<i> user's attention, so they should be suggestive of a likely next step. If 
</I>&gt;<i> there's 20 buttons on a page, that is very difficult for the user to 
</I>&gt;<i> process.  That's not to say it's unresolvable -- you can use icons on 
</I>&gt;<i> less significant buttons to make them more compact and visually less 
</I>&gt;<i> attention-grabbing.
</I>
Granted.


&gt;<i> &gt; That's exactly what I meant. People shouldn't avoid it -- something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that looks like a link should be a fricking link. I should see the URI 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the status bar and be able to copy it and paste it and open 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple windows and so forth and it should all just be idempotent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point was that these links typically represent actions that are 
</I>&gt;<i> independent of their encosing form (if any form exists).  That's what I 
</I>&gt;<i> think people are often trying to accomplish with these links.  And 
</I>&gt;<i> actually, I think that might be a good justification/explanation why 
</I>&gt;<i> people are drawn to links for certain actions; they represent an action 
</I>&gt;<i> that does not take any context in the page.
</I>
But it does, otherwise there wouldn't be an entity body to the POST (e.g. 
id=1 in the example above)...

I agreee. I think we should see if the WF2 features help with this, and if

When I look at typical UIs I come across each day, I still find that 
things that actually _do_ something are buttons, and things that are 
&quot;safe&quot; are links.


&gt;<i> Consider the example of a webmail application. These often allow

Sure, but to the user all that's happened is that they've viewed it. The 
&quot;read&quot; state is just describing that.

</I>
I agree that it's hard for the server to know if an e-mail was viewed due 
to prefetching or by the user. But in general I think that this is a GET 
case, not a POST case.

I certainly agree that servers should be doing confirmations when 
receiving a GET for something that should be a POST. But that doesn't stop 
the original problem unless we also add &lt;a method=&quot;&quot;&gt;, which isn't a given 
IMHO, as noted above.

Well, the confirmation could be a form with POST.

I agree.

I rather agree.

Interesting.

You disagree that users subconsciously think links are safe?

I agree that it's not perfect.

I'm not sure &lt;span&gt; with JavaScript is really acceptable, but yeah.

If we were to do this, that would certainly be a good way of doing it.

Indeed.
