</I>
Actually, research suggests that rev= is basically only used when authors 
make mistakes. The most common rev=&quot;&quot; value is &quot;made&quot; (11 million pages 
out of a billion pages), which is redundant with rel=author, and the 
second most common one is &quot;stylesheet&quot; (2 million out of a billion pages), 
which is a mistake. The next most common value is &quot;owns&quot; (110 thousand 
pages out of a billion), which I don't understand, and the fourth most 
common value is &quot;author&quot; (50 thousand out of a billion), which seems to be 
a mistake as well.

This is a very poor track record for a feature.


&gt;<i> Here are some use cases:
</I>&gt;<i>   - rev=&quot;footnote&quot; for a link back from the footnote or endnote to
</I>&gt;<i>     the source anchor in the main text
</I>
This could be handled by a rel value, e.g. rel=source.


&gt;<i>   - rev=&quot;help&quot; for a link to the part of the site that the help
</I>&gt;<i>     text is about
</I>
...as could this.


&gt;<i>   - rev=&quot;author&quot; on a personal site or resume for links to documents
</I>&gt;<i>     s/he has written
</I>
Why need a rel type at all for this?

</I>
I think we should work the other way around. We should start with a 
problem, and work out the solution, not the other way around.

I agree.


&gt;<i> &gt;    - rev=&quot;author&quot; on a personal site or resume for links to documents

</I>&gt;<i> Here, you're using |rev| to replace missing metadata in the target

</I>
Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I scanned over it, and I noticed one good point. People often 
</I>&gt;<i> don't bother putting in relationship types for links. Therefore, |rev| 
</I>&gt;<i> could establish what the relationship is when you reach the target

</I>
Evidence suggests it is not.


&gt;<i> At least with |rel|, you could harvest hyperlinks and put them into a 
</I>&gt;<i> link toolbar. With |rev|, you're describing the relationship type of the 
</I>&gt;<i> current document. Therefore, I really don't see what user agents are 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to do with |rev| and how they can create a useful interface 
</I>&gt;<i> that can exploit this attribute.
</I>
Indeed.

In practice, it seems authors and users alike don't really care for this.


&gt;<i> AFAIK there is no difference between

Indeed. So why have rev=next?

Indeed.


&gt;<i> Also note that &quot;refutation&quot; is a bad example, as it would only ever be

Good point!


&gt;<i> So what we're seeing is that |rev| encourages us to define relationship 
</I>&gt;<i> types specifically for |rev| that are useless for |rel|.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Another thing is that |rev| is largely self-serving:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://whatwg.org">http://whatwg.org</A>&quot; rev=&quot;supreme-master-guru&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By it's nature, |rev| defines how the universe relates to you. Thus, how 
</I>&gt;<i> can you help but put yourself at the center of the universe?
</I>
A point worth considering indeed.

It doesn't seem like a rel=&quot;&quot; is needed for this. The link itself is clear 
enough (see, e.g., wikipedia).
