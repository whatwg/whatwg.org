</I>&gt;<i> Say, for example, you have a website which has sections of content that

</I>
In general you should try to avoid using markup like this, which is tied 
to the presentation, and instead use markup that describes the meaning of 
the document, and have stylesheets keyed to that.


&gt;<i> However, if I then wanted to add additional special styling to the first 
</I>&gt;<i> and third div, (e.g.. a border and background color) it is less 
</I>&gt;<i> graceful. I could add style attributes, but that would be wasteful if I 
</I>&gt;<i> want to do this on a large scale. Multiple classes would be confusing.
</I>
I don't see why multiple classes would be confusing.


&gt;<i> A nice solution would be the addition of a few div tags. (e.g. &lt;div2&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div3&gt;, &lt;div4&gt; and &lt;div5&gt;.) Then you could do something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> div1 {text-indent:0px;}
</I>&gt;<i> div2 {text-indent:10px;}
</I>&gt;<i> div3 {text-indent:20px;}
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div1&gt;This text isn't indented at all!&lt;/div1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div2&gt;This text is indented a little.&lt;/div2&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div3&gt;Lots of indentation.&lt;/div3&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div1&gt;No indentation here!&lt;/div1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is much more human-readable, and the addition of additional styles 
</I>&gt;<i> is now elegant and easy with the use of classes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div1 class=&quot;bluestyle&quot;&gt;This text isn't indented at all!&lt;/div1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div2&gt;This text is indented a little.&lt;/div2&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div3 class=&quot;redstyle&quot;&gt;Lots of indentation.&lt;/div3&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div1&gt;No indentation here!&lt;/div1&gt;
</I>
I'm not sure I agree that this is more elegant.


&gt;<i> I also think that it would simply be easier to write code if there were 
</I>&gt;<i> a few extra non-semantic empty tags. HTML5 needs improvements that will 
</I>&gt;<i> make people want to use it. Making it easier to code than HTML 4 will 
</I>&gt;<i> ensure a quicker and wider acceptance.
</I>
The goal isn't wide acceptance, the goal is a higher quality language.


&gt;<i> I am okay with the unimaginative numbering of the extra elements, as it 
</I>&gt;<i> would make it easy to have a lot of new elements. However, there are 
</I>&gt;<i> countless possibilities: &lt;section&gt;, &lt;chunk&gt;, &lt;partition&gt;, &lt;block&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;enclosure&gt;, &lt;zone&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;sector&gt;, &lt;quadrant&gt; etc...
</I>
Well, we have &lt;section&gt; amd &lt;figure&gt; now, for sections and figures 
respectively.


&gt;<i> Are there other people who have found themselves wishing for another 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span&gt; or &lt;div&gt;-like tag?
</I>
Apparently not. :-)

Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> #tree &gt; div &gt; div { background: yellow; }
</I>
Indeed. One could also use nested &lt;ul&gt;s for a tree.

</I>
You can hook CSS to the meaning, it doesn't have to be an explicit hook. 
For example, you can style your headings:

   h1 { color: blue; }

...and the first paragraph after a heading:

   h1 + p { text-indent: 2em; }

...and so on.

Indeed.

Sadly true.


&gt;<i> I think the supposition that multiple class names are confusing is 
</I>&gt;<i> flawed.  What's wrong with saying &lt;div class=&quot;redtext indentmore&quot;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> (besides the fact that you'd want more useful, informative class names 
</I>&gt;<i> than &quot;redtext&quot; and &quot;indentmore&quot;)?  By looking at it, someone could 
</I>&gt;<i> readily tell it's got the properties of both &quot;redtext&quot; and &quot;indentmore&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> In my estimation, being able to combine classes is one of the more

</I>
I agree (modulo those class names being poor choices).
