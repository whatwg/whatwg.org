<PRE>Dnia 31-10-2007, &#347;ro o godzinie 17:56 +0200, Mikko Rantalainen
napisa&#322;(a):
&gt;<i> The section
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5.6.2. APIs for the text field selections
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#textFieldSelection">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#textFieldSelection</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> defines attributes selectionStart and selectionEnd and method
</I>&gt;<i> setSelectionRange().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These features are enough to identify the selected data and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> modify the contents of text field by scripting so that the modification
</I>&gt;<i> is affected by selected region.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There're some problems, though. I represent the following use case:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A page contains a textarea. Author adds an additional button for adding
</I>&gt;<i> a pair of parenthesis around the selected text. The javascript code for
</I>&gt;<i> this feature (given that &quot;e&quot; is the text field element) is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e.value = e.value.substr(0,e.selectionStart) + &quot;(&quot; +
</I>&gt;<i> e.value.substr(e.selectionStart,e.selectionEnd) + &quot;)&quot; +
</I>&gt;<i> e.value.substr(e.selectionEnd);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problems with the above code:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) From the UA view, the entire contents of the field has been replaced
</I>&gt;<i> with a new value and therefore the undo feature of the field cannot
</I>&gt;<i> represent the fact that the script only added character &quot;(&quot; before the
</I>&gt;<i> selection and character &quot;)&quot; after the selection. A method to update only
</I>&gt;<i> the selected part of the value would be needed to correctly describe the
</I>&gt;<i> real change to the value to the UA.
</I>
There is no behavioural difference between removing just the parentheses
and reverting to the previous content: the result is the same.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) There's no good way to set the selection because if the scripts calls
</I>&gt;<i>  setSelectionRange() the UA &quot;must set the selection of the text field&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> but it is not required to modify the focus or scrolled part of the text
</I>&gt;<i> field in any way. In addition, there's no way to query the scroll
</I>&gt;<i> position of the selection so the script cannot work around this issue
</I>&gt;<i> either. As a result, setSelectionRange() may be used to set the
</I>&gt;<i> selection but the selected selection may end up being out of the view
</I>&gt;<i> from the user point of view. As textarea element may have soft wrapping
</I>&gt;<i> enabled, the script has no way to even compute the correct line number
</I>&gt;<i> for the selection start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the issue 1) I suggest adding a new method
</I>&gt;<i> 	replaceSelectionText(in string selection_value)
</I>&gt;<i> which replaces the section of field's value between offsets
</I>&gt;<i> selectionStart and selectionEnd with the string selection_value. This
</I>&gt;<i> replacement should not destroy the text field's undo history - instead
</I>&gt;<i> it should be treated similarly to paste (text) operation.
</I>
Because of the platform widgets API limitations, the user agent would
have to go through the the same procedure you quoted anyway (or
re-implement platform widgets).  There is no way to replace a part in
the native text box.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the issue 2) I suggest changing the behavior of setSelectionRange()
</I>&gt;<i> to require that the selection must be made visible to the user. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> something along the lines &quot;UA must scroll the text field so that the
</I>&gt;<i> start of the selection is visible.&quot; 
</I>
I do not feel like I would like that.

&gt;<i> As an alternative, a method such as
</I>&gt;<i> void focusSelection() could be added so that the script may hint the UA
</I>&gt;<i> that the selection should be made visible after the script has called
</I>&gt;<i> setSelectionRange() and replaceSelectionText() multiple times (so that
</I>&gt;<i> these actions do not repeatedly scroll the text field's viewport).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Rather &quot;reveal selection&quot;, if you please.  There is some correlation
between focus and visibility but they are not tightly coupled.

Best regards,
Chris
