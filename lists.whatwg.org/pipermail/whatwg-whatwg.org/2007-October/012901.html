I've made the spec say that it stops playing when you remove it from the 
document. However, that doesn't really mean much, it can still play when 
it's out of the document.


&gt;<i> -- when all JS references to the element have been dropped (and garbage
</I>&gt;<i> collection runs)?
</I>&gt;<i> -- when the user leaves the page?
</I>&gt;<i> -- when the end of the stream is reached? (which could be &quot;never&quot;)
</I>
I've explicitly addressed all of these in the spec.

Indeed, that's an important use case.

</I>
Bookmarklets are effectively browser-specific and thus interoperability 
isn't a concern for them. They can use UA-specific extensions if needed.

If a user wants to mute all audio, a &quot;mute&quot; key on the keyboard or in the 
UA's chrome seems like the more likely solution, both of which are 
possible within the constraints of the spec.

This is what the spec now requires.

Yes. The sound from &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements isn't stylistic; it's 
asynchronously played content, and thus not affected by CSS properties.


&gt;<i> My current opinion is that &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements should behave 
</I>&gt;<i> like &lt;img&gt; and load/play whether or not they're in a document, but they

</I>&gt;<i> should be the default for &lt;audio&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it's a rather tangled issue.
</I>
Having to insert audio elements in the tree to have them play seems 
artificial, especially since they wouldn't play where you put them -- the 
tree position would be basically meaningless. A typical use case is the:

   var a = new Audio('fx.wav');
   a.autoplay = true;

...or similar.

Right, that too.

Per spec, at the earliest of the two. (Though in the former case, if the 
user returned to the page and the bfcache hadn't flushed the message away, 
the sound would resume playing.)

The spec requires audible elements not to be garbage collected.


&gt;<i> Or do you mean by 'play' only move forward in their time-position, not

</I>
Sound emission.


&gt;<i> What happens in opera is if you do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> myAudio = new Audio(&quot;foo.wav&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> myAudio.onload = function () {

</I>&gt;<i>   myAudio = null;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When will the audio stop playing?
</I>
Per spec, the element will play through to the end (or until the browsing 
context is navigated away).

</I>
No, 'display:none' affects the render tree, of which the audio component 
is not part. The video component would get removed, but the audio 
component plays asynchronously and thus there is nothing to remove when 
you do 'display:none'.

Agreed, and made so.


&gt;<i> Stopping at remove time ensures that sounds and videos end at a

</I>
Good call.

</I>
Well, the load won't start unless you do one of the following:

   * insert a media element (&lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt;) into a document
     while it has a src= or &lt;source&gt;

   * set a src= on a media element already in a document

   * add a &lt;source&gt; to a media element already in a document

   * you call .load() directly

   * you use the new Audio(url) constructor and specify a URL.

...and nothing plays until it's loaded (and it won't start playing unless 
you've set autoplay, even then).

So this seems covered.


&gt;<i> This does leave the problem of what happens if the element is garbage 
</I>&gt;<i> collected while it's playing sound. It'd be nice to hear what experience 
</I>&gt;<i> opera has here.
</I>
The spec requires that it not be.


&gt;<i> I would be a little hesitant to say that elements that play are never 
</I>&gt;<i> garbage collected. That would make it easy for the page author to 
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally leak &lt;video&gt;s without sound and muted-but-playing 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt;s for the duration of the page. This sucks up both CPU 
</I>&gt;<i> cycles and memory.
</I>
The spec allows the optimisation that videos/audio be garbage collected 
before they end, if they are silent.

Agreed (s/stop/pause/, and actually not invoking the method directly for 
various reasons but the effect is almost identical).

Such documents aren't ever in browsing contexts, and thus can't ever be 
active documents, and thus can never advance their playback position, per 
the spec (they can still end up loading the contents, currently, though 
since the spec allows UAs to arbitrarily limit bandwidth usage to zero for 
media elements, that doesn't really mean much).

I think we should wait for v2 before adding this, but it's an interesting 
idea. We'll see if there is demand.
