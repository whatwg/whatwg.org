</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/216441/">http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/216441/</A>&gt;. What's so special about the 
</I>&gt;<i> query?
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> 2) Many offline web apps will let you [...] make changes, including not 
</I>&gt;<i> just changing existing items, but also creating new items. To do this, 
</I>&gt;<i> at minimum there needs to be an API to inject a new resource into the 
</I>&gt;<i> offline cache programatically, with the data explicitly provided. (Let's 
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the syncing problem implicit in an application with global IDs 
</I>&gt;<i> allowing offline creation of new items, and pretend that syncing when 
</I>&gt;<i> returning to online mode will solve it or that IDs will be namespaced by 
</I>&gt;<i> creating user somehow.)
</I>
I think we provide features that are enough to do this now, though not in 
the way you really describe.


&gt;<i> 3) Offline-enabled apps with a page per resource (like bugzilla or 
</I>&gt;<i> upcoming) and which allow editing offline will need to be changed so 
</I>&gt;<i> that at least in offline mode each page can suck its relevant data from 
</I>&gt;<i> the offline database to update itself, OR manually generate an updated 
</I>&gt;<i> page to stick into the offline cache.
</I>
Indeed, though we don't support the part after the OR.


&gt;<i> 4) To suck down all the items a user cares about into a local database, 
</I>&gt;<i> you need to suck down the data, but also have some way to get at the 
</I>&gt;<i> page when offline. It's not strictly necessary to pull all the pages 
</I>&gt;<i> from the server. You could alternately use the API to explicitly add an 
</I>&gt;<i> item to the offline cache, per item #2, and do a bunch of client-side 
</I>&gt;<i> work to generate and save an offline copy of each page. For that matter, 
</I>&gt;<i> each might be an identical template that just knows how to suck down the 
</I>&gt;<i> data from the net or the local database as appropriate.
</I>
I think the spec allows you to get this effect, though not really in this 
manner.


&gt;<i> 5) Now, given 2, 3 and 4, it seems like the online and offline versions 
</I>&gt;<i> of the app must necessarily diverge a little bit, if the offline app is 
</I>&gt;<i> to offer any form of editing while offline.
</I>
I don't understand what the difference between an online app and an 
offline app would be in this world.


&gt;<i> 6) It's potentially costly to download data mulltiple times, so if you 
</I>&gt;<i> pull the remote data into a local database, you won't also want to pull 
</I>&gt;<i> every page reflecting that data, instead you will want to generate 
</I>&gt;<i> templates client-side and insert them into the offline cache. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> it seems like a relatively small step from there to having a single 
</I>&gt;<i> fallback page to be used for all URIs that are part of the app but 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't gotten downloaded in the course of normal use. And this would be 
</I>&gt;<i> a huge optimization, since it would save the client the need to manually 
</I>&gt;<i> generate each page for a resource of interest that has not yet been 
</I>&gt;<i> visited.
</I>
Indeed, that's what the spec has now.


&gt;<i> Given point #1, I think this should be based on textual prefix matching 
</I>&gt;<i> of the URI, not just dropping the query (the scheme and authority 
</I>&gt;<i> sections should be treated specially, of course, it should not be 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to have a fallback page in someone else's security domain). This 
</I>&gt;<i> will allow matching paths and also matching only specific kinds of 
</I>&gt;<i> queries (where the first parameter is set to some specific value, say). 
</I>&gt;<i> However, to make offline and online mode diverge as little as possible, 
</I>&gt;<i> I think perhaps such fallback pages should apply only when offline. When 
</I>&gt;<i> online, the UA should go to the real page. With the prefix-based 
</I>&gt;<i> fallback page solution, I'm not sure it will be necessary to also 
</I>&gt;<i> support individual client-generated pages.
</I>
That's basically what the spec has now.

Right.
