I'm worried about people seeing quote(), going the path of using quote(), 
and then forgetting to use it.


&gt;<i> I think not having quote will make people write their own, and every so 
</I>&gt;<i> often fail at it. People that don't think about the possibility of 
</I>&gt;<i> getting exploited aren't going to use neither '?' nor quote() so they 
</I>&gt;<i> are hosed either way.
</I>
If we include examples for how to do this (embedding ? directly into the 
query and adding the stuff to the array), will that work? It's easier to 
do than quoting.


&gt;<i> What are we trying to prevent here. The page can only attack data it 
</I>&gt;<i> owns, so the only thing I can think of is preventing bugs. Though that 
</I>&gt;<i> is certainly not unimportant.
</I>
True.
