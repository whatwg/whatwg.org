Is this required for compat or can we leave it as is? How widely is it

Is the way it is phrased now acceptable?

The spec sidesteps this by defining the dimensions as CSS pixels.

</I>
I think we're going to have to work this out -- maybe there should be two 
things, document conformance and related resource conformance.


&gt;<i> What image formats should a conformance checker know about? GIF, PNG and

</I>
Same as browsers, I guess.

Agreed.

This is fine in the spec as it is today.

This doesn't seem to be true.


&gt;<i> CSS values are relative to the the parent element in HTML tree:

</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; displays image 50x50px.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attributes values are relative to the actual size of the image:

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;276x110.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That may be very useful in many cases, so as a HTML-coder, I don't think

I couldn't reproduce the behaviour you give above. Do you have test cases 
showing this?

</I>
This will be defined in the rendering section in due course.

</I>
I agree that style=&quot;height: 100px&quot; is different from height=&quot;100&quot; only in 
a syntactical fashion, from a semantic standpoint.

It is presentational. But it's ok.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but that is not what the height and width attributes are. They say

</I>
Yes and no. They do, in practice, control the size at which the images are 
drawn. But as defined in HTML5, they actually give the &quot;real&quot; image size, 
even if the size in the image file itself is &quot;inaccurate&quot;.

</I>
I think the spec handles these cases now (except for the 'em' thing, which 
still requires CSS).

The spec handles this by requiring the attributes to be given in CSS 
pixels.

Is the compromise in the spec today acceptable?

I'm all for making &lt;img&gt; be non-interactive.


The spec currently has an open issue w.r.t. what limitations to put on the 
endpoint of an &lt;img&gt; src=&quot;&quot;.

Fair enough. I'm not sure pointing to itself is a huge problem though.
