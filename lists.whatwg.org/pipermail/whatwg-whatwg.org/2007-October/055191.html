</I>
In general I agree, but when we don't have a single solution we can think 
of that's any good, it seems highly experimental (and thus inappropriate 
for HTML5) to have the requirement in the spec.

Neither can I.

Actually, lack of imagination on everyone's part _is_ a good reason to 
leave out a feature. We shouldn't be using HTML standardisation as a 
research lab, we should be standardising things we know work.

Right.

</I>&gt;<i> Roughly, one solution might be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The user is playing a video within a web page. They click on full screen 
</I>&gt;<i> mode. The toolbar, status bar, menu bar, and so forth are removed, 
</I>&gt;<i> leaving just the title bar and close, minimize, and restore controls. If 
</I>&gt;<i> there is no movement of the mouse for 2-5 seconds the title bar 
</I>&gt;<i> disappears. With movement of the mouse again, the title bar reappears. 
</I>&gt;<i> If the user clicks on the close control, the window returns to its 
</I>&gt;<i> original state while continuing to play the video within the page. Also, 
</I>&gt;<i> If the video comes to an end the window returns to its original state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't want the title bar to control closing full screen mode, the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser could display a special video bar during full screen mode 
</I>&gt;<i> directly underneath the title bar. This bar could have play controls on 
</I>&gt;<i> it. Again, the video bar (as well as the title bar) would disappear 
</I>&gt;<i> after so many seconds of no mouse movement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to redisplaying the title bar (and potentially the video 
</I>&gt;<i> bar) on mouse movement, it might be helpful to have a way to overlay 
</I>&gt;<i> play controls (pause, stop, and so forth) on top of the video at this 
</I>&gt;<i> time giving the designer a way to add those controls or supplement those 
</I>&gt;<i> that would be in the video bar if the video bar was implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Standard hotkeys in full screen mode might be nice, e.g., space bar 
</I>&gt;<i> (play, pause).
</I>
That's what the spec has now. The user has to tell the UA to go 
full-screen.


&gt;<i> With javascript it is already possible to make full screen web pages. If 
</I>&gt;<i> advertisers were going to exploit this they would have by now.
</I>
Actually, they can't, as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> Standardizing full screen video mode seems like a good idea since users 
</I>&gt;<i> will learn what to expect and how to navigate it. Otherwise, you 
</I>&gt;<i> potentially have a 1000 different implementations of fullscreen mode 
</I>&gt;<i> devised by designers requiring the end user to figure out each time how 
</I>&gt;<i> to navigate that particular implementation.
</I>
You only need one implementation -- the user agent's. It just means you 
can't have little JavaScript UI to trigger it, but I think that's ok.

</I>&gt;<i> But the question remains:  should we provide standard markup to do

</I>&gt;<i> issues (and what)?  And if not, how do we still need to say about the 
</I>&gt;<i> security issues for browsers that do it anyway through UI, extension, or 
</I>&gt;<i> both?
</I>
Through UI there's not really a security problem. Through an extension, 
that's up to the UA. We can't mention all the ways that UAs can shoot 
themselves through the foot. If an extension turns out to be good, then we 
can spec it.

</I>
Why do we need an API for it? Just use CSS. It's a few lines of code.
