Based on the arguments given in this thread (the bulk of which are quoted 
below) I have concluded that we should not include &lt;center&gt; in the HTML5 
language. However, it will be defined in the rendering section in due 
course, and will continue to work in browsers for the forseeable future.


&gt;<i> I'd like to recommend that the WHATWG bring back &lt;MENU&gt; &amp; &lt;DIR&gt;, because 
</I>&gt;<i> these elements have semantic meaning and don't significantly affect how 
</I>&gt;<i> the list is presented. The lack of significant effects means that the 
</I>&gt;<i> legacy browsers will still be able to make use of the elements. The good

</I>&gt;<i> greater diversity, standardization and detail, without requiring 
</I>&gt;<i> enhancements to UA technology. You could make any type of a list and it 
</I>&gt;<i> would work. The default styling may not be what you want, but it would 
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>
&lt;menu&gt; is reintroduced for context menus and toolbars.

&lt;dir&gt; at this point is basically redundant with &lt;nav&gt;&lt;ul&gt;, so should 
probably continue to be omitted, so as to not give too many mixed messages 
(HTML4 deprecated it, so reintroducing it now without substantial 
improvements or strong reasons would just be confusing).


&gt;<i> I'd like to recommend that the WHATWG standardize &lt;NL&gt;. I suggest this 
</I>&gt;<i> because &lt;NL&gt; is shorter than &lt;NAV&gt; and because &lt;NL&gt; is consistent with 
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML. As I typed the previous sentence, I noticed that &lt;NL&gt; is much 
</I>&gt;<i> easier to type with 1 hand, than &lt;NAV&gt;.
</I>
Assuming you mean XHTML2's &lt;nl&gt;&lt;li href&gt;, you can achieve the same results 
in HTML5 using &lt;nav&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href&gt;, in a way that is backwards 
compatible with legacy user agents.

I'm not sure I'd say it's encouraged, but yes.

For non-Web publishing, I would strongly recommend investigating in a

HTML5 explicitly allows multiple &lt;h1&gt; elements. You could also use &lt;h2&gt;.

There's an open issue on exactly what to do with &lt;div&gt;, but yeah.


&gt;<i> Authors should use presentational markup whenever there is no available

</I>
True... but it's not clear if elements like &lt;font&gt; and &lt;center&gt; are the 
best way of addressing this.


&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     This was defined in HTML 3.0 and 3.2 to mean about the same as
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;section&gt; means in Web Applications 1.0, but was soon repurposed by
</I>&gt;<i>     Web authors for any block for which the author could not think of a
</I>&gt;<i>     better element. It will continue to be used that way in HTML 5,
</I>&gt;<i>     because even if replacement elements like &lt;cartoonpanel&gt;, &lt;login&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;order&gt;, &lt;search&gt;, &lt;sidebar&gt;, &lt;signup&gt;, and &lt;sudokupuzzle&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     were introduced in an attempt to narrow the use of &lt;div&gt;, authors
</I>&gt;<i>     would hardly ever bother using such specialized elements, since
</I>&gt;<i>     they'd get no benefit from doing so. (But &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;menu&gt; will
</I>&gt;<i>     reduce the use of &lt;div&gt; by a small amount, because they have
</I>&gt;<i>     distinct and useful default presentations.)
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> &lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;dd&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     These elements were semantic until HTML 4.0, which belied their
</I>&gt;<i>     supposed meaning both in an example in the spec, and in the markup
</I>&gt;<i>     of the spec itself. They remain presentational in the current Web
</I>&gt;<i>     Applications 1.0 draft, because use for both &quot;terms and
</I>&gt;<i>     definitions&quot; and &quot;name-value data&quot; is still too broad to have a
</I>&gt;<i>     coherent meaning. (For example, from the markup alone, a search
</I>&gt;<i>     engine will not be able to tell whether &quot;Ian Hickson, Google,
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ian at hixie.ch</A>&quot; is the answer to &quot;Who is the editor of Web
</I>&gt;<i>     Applications 1.0?&quot;, or a definition of the word &quot;editor&quot; itself.)
</I>
The latter would need a &lt;dfn&gt; around the word &quot;editor&quot;.


&gt;<i> &lt;i&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     This has always been presentational, and will continue to be so in
</I>&gt;<i>     the majority of HTML 5 documents. Most authors will assume it has
</I>&gt;<i>     the same purpose as it did in previous versions of HTML; and many
</I>&gt;<i>     of the authors who actually read that part of the spec will giggle
</I>&gt;<i>     at the &quot;instance of a term&quot; frippery and disregard it.
</I>
This has changed since you commented on it, I believe. Now it's still 
&quot;presentational&quot;, but it is at least media-independent, being defined in 
a way that is still usable in speech contexts.


&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     This has been semantic until now, meaning a paragraph. But the
</I>&gt;<i>     current Web Applications 1.0 draft pretends that the English word
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;paragraph&quot; means something much broader than it really does, so
</I>&gt;<i>     broad that it will have no semantics at all. (For example, someone
</I>&gt;<i>     instructed to write a ten-paragraph essay will get incorrect
</I>&gt;<i>     results from a paragraph count if, as suggested by Web Apps 1.0,
</I>&gt;<i>     they use &lt;p&gt; for the essay's byline.) As a result, &lt;p&gt; will come to
</I>&gt;<i>     mean &quot;present this as a block with extra vertical margins&quot;.
</I>
The byline would be in the &lt;header&gt;, which would presumably be excluded 
from the paragraph count.

(I strongly feel that there is a difference between &lt;div&gt; used for 
grouping thematically related blocks, and &lt;p&gt; used for separating 
thematically related inline content, e.g. parts of a form. I want to make 
inline-in-&lt;div&gt; non-conforming in the case where &lt;p&gt; could better be 
used, but without making it non-conforming when it is being used to make 
custom widgets. I don't really see what to do about this. Maybe only 
allow &lt;div&gt; to contain blocks or &lt;span&gt; elements (but not both)?)


&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     This is semantic in the Web Apps 1.0 draft, but whether it remains
</I>&gt;<i>     so in the real world will depend on who is faster: UA vendors
</I>&gt;<i>     distributing software that prominently takes advantage of the
</I>&gt;<i>     structure &lt;section&gt; is supposed to provide, or eager tech Weblog
</I>&gt;<i>     authors misguidedly replacing all the occurrences of &lt;div&gt; with
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;section&gt; in their templates in an attempt to be &quot;more semantic&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>     My money, regretfully, is on the Weblog authors.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;b&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     If &lt;b&gt; is retained, it will remain a presentational element for
</I>&gt;<i>     making text bold ad hoc, regardless of how the spec defines it. If
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;b&gt; is dropped, &lt;strong&gt; will become a de facto presentational
</I>&gt;<i>     element for making text bold ad hoc, regardless of how the spec
</I>&gt;<i>     defines it. (To a small extent this has already happened, thanks to
</I>&gt;<i>     those people who have given the impression that &lt;b&gt; is naughty.)
</I>
The spec tries to address this in a way similar to &lt;i&gt;.


&gt;<i> &lt;style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     This has always been presentational; it exists for no other reason
</I>&gt;<i>     than to specify presentation.
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;<i> That's why I think that every semantic element should have a

</I>&gt;<i> alternative, then there would have less likely been any tampering with 
</I>&gt;<i> the semantic elements.
</I>
Pages would just be using exclusively the presentational elements, and 
we'd be in no better shape than everyone using XSL:FO or &lt;font&gt;. Shouldn't 
we aim for better than that? (I'm not sure how to achieve better.)
