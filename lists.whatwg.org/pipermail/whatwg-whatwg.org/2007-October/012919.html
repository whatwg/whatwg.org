</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any reason we couldn't state the removing the element from the

</I>
Good point. Fixed.


&gt;<i> I think that it is still currently possible that a currently playing 
</I>&gt;<i> element can get garbage collected. Alternatively, that it is possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> create elements that will never stop playing, even if the user navigates 
</I>&gt;<i> away. Consider the following scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Page A opens a new window containing Page B
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Page A creates a reference to Page B
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Page B creates an &lt;audio&gt; element that doesn't live in its Document
</I>&gt;<i>    and sticks it in a global variable of its context.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Window containing Page B is closed. Page B does not go away since
</I>&gt;<i>    Page A is holding a reference to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Page B calls .play() on the &lt;audio&gt;
</I>
At this point nothing happens, because B isn't an active document, and 
playback only occurs (according to the spec) if the ownerDocument is an 
active document.


&gt;<i> The only step here that is slightly suspicious is step 5 since a 
</I>&gt;<i> closed-but-alive page is running script.
</I>
Right, but the point would still hold if page A called .play().


&gt;<i> I believe this can happen in a number of ways, the simplest being that 
</I>&gt;<i> Page A calls a function on Page B. But I suspect there are also events 
</I>&gt;<i> that can fire in Page B even after it has closed.
</I>
Actually per spec, if I recall, you can't run script if you're not an 
active document. (To start with, your Window object won't have your 
properties any more, which makes things difficult if we allow script.)


&gt;<i> I believe the best solution here is to say that step 5 should throw an 
</I>&gt;<i> exception. I.e. you can't start playing a media element whose 
</I>&gt;<i> .ownerDocument is not a displayed document.
</I>
What do you think of what the spec says at the moment?
