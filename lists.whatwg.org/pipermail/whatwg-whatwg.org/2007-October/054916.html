<PRE>Hi Chris,

this is a very good discussion to have and I would be curious about
the opinions of people.

CMML has been developed with an aim to provide &quot;html&quot;-type timed text
annotations for audio/video - in particular hyperlinks and annotations
to temporal sections of videos. This is both, more generic than
captions, and less generic in that captions have formatting and are
displayed in a particular way.

One option is to extend CMML to provide the caption functionality
inside CMML. This would not be difficult and in fact, the current
&quot;desc&quot; tag is already being used for such functionality in xine. It is
however suboptimal since it mixes aims. A better way would be to
invent a &quot;caption&quot; tag for CMML which would have some formatting
functionality (colours, alignment etc. - the things that the EBU
subtitling standard <A HREF="http://www.limeboy.com/support.php?kbID=12">http://www.limeboy.com/support.php?kbID=12</A> is
providing).

Another option would be to disregard CMML completely and invent a new
timed text logical bitstream for Ogg which would just have the
subtitles. This could use any existing time text format and would just
require a bitstream mapping for Ogg, which should not be hard to do at
all.

Now for Ogg Skeleton: Ogg Skeleton will indeed have a part to play in
this, however not directly for specification of the timed text
annotations. Ogg Skeleton is a track that describes what is inside the
Ogg file. So, assuming we would have a multitrack video file with a
video track, an audio track, an alternate audio track (e.g. speex as
suggested by you for accessibility to blind people), a CMML track (for
hyperlinking into and out of the video), and several caption tracks
(for different languages), then Ogg Skeleton would explain exactly
that these exist without the need for a program to decode the Ogg file
fully.

I think we need to understand exactly what we expect from the caption
tracks before being able to suggest an optimal solution. If e.g. we
want caption tracks with hyperlinks on a temporal basis and some more
metadata around that which is machine readable, then an extension of
CMML would make the most sense.

Regards,
Silvia.
