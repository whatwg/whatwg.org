The fear is that people would do:

   db.executeSql('...', [], function(...) {
     db.executeSql('...', []); // depends on the first call
   });

...without a transaction.


&gt;<i> database.transaction().executeSql(...) is both &quot;transactioned,&quot; fitting 
</I>&gt;<i> into the current API, and &quot;fire it and forget it,&quot; which is very easy 
</I>&gt;<i> for simple developer use.
</I>
Sure, you can do that now (well, using callbacks instead of chaining).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The other problem I see that makes the current spec more complex is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the transaction callback. I think a better API would be:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; SQLTransaction transaction();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; SQLTransaction transaction(in SQLTransactionErrorCallback errorCallback);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Then you can call executeSql on the transaction object without 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; having to wait for the callback. Sure, closures in JavaScript make 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this somewhat less painful, but closures are usually expensive and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; add additional complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with returning the object is that then we have no scope to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know when the transaction should close.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the actual transaction to the database is opened in 
</I>&gt;<i> transaction steps 1 and 2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we adopt this model, we'd have a SQLTransaction object, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> transaction steps themselves won't have started.  The first call to 
</I>&gt;<i> executeSql() could &quot;set the transaction into motion&quot;, as it were - 
</I>&gt;<i> starting with steps 1 and 2 where the transaction is opened.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adopting this model is quite compatible with the current transaction 
</I>&gt;<i> steps with only small modifications, imho.
</I>
   var transaction = db.transaction();
   transaction.executeSql(...);
   transaction.executeSql(...);

How do you know when the transaction is ended? You have no scoping.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My understanding with this design is that you would get this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; SQLTransaction object back and it would just sit around, not doing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anything.  When you first call executeSql on it, you kick off the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; transaction steps as they already exist.  Until you call 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; executeSql(), it's just a dummy object that doesn't interfere with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the database at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What if there's a problem with opening the transaction itself? You 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't want to run all the code for preparing the statement only to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find you didn't have a chance for the statement to run in the first 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While the spec *does* currently enforce preparing the statement at the 
</I>&gt;<i> time of calling executeSql() just to mark the statement bogus, &quot;marking 
</I>&gt;<i> the statement bogus&quot; is only a flag that takes effect later during the 
</I>&gt;<i> transaction effects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, why is it so necessary to prepare the statement before the 
</I>&gt;<i> transaction is opened?  Why don't we parse and validate the statement in 
</I>&gt;<i> the transaction steps themselves?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we adopted both of these models (Tims idea and allowing the statement

</I>&gt;<i> opening the transaction itself, you'd get the

</I>&gt;<i> touched at all.
</I>
I'm talking about:

   var transaction = db.transaction(errorCallback);
   // the transaction has failed at this point
   // but we have no way to stop the next few lines from running:
   ...do lots of work to get the data to put into the transaction...
   transaction.executeSql('...', [expensiveData], ...);

vs:

   db.transaction(function (transaction) {
     // this never gets called, since the transaction failed
     ...do lots of work to get the data to put into the transaction...
     transaction.executeSql('...', [expensiveData], ...);
   }, errorCallback);
