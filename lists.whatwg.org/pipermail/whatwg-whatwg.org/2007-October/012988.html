</I>
I don't know that the goal is to adopt a &quot;non-transactioned&quot; API, but  
rather to present the transactioned API in a manner that is also easy  
to use for &quot;fire off one sql query and forget it&quot; purposes.

database.transaction().executeSql(...) is both &quot;transactioned,&quot;  
fitting into the current API, and &quot;fire it and forget it,&quot; which is  
very easy for simple developer use.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SQLTransaction transaction();
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SQLTransaction transaction(in SQLTransactionErrorCallback  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errorCallback);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then you can call executeSql on the transaction object without

</I>
Currently, the actual transaction to the database is opened in  
transaction steps 1 and 2.

If we adopt this model, we'd have a SQLTransaction object, but the  
transaction steps themselves won't have started.  The first call to  
executeSql() could &quot;set the transaction into motion&quot;, as it were -  
starting with steps 1 and 2 where the transaction is opened.

Adopting this model is quite compatible with the current transaction  
steps with only small modifications, imho.

</I>
While the spec *does* currently enforce preparing the statement at the  
time of calling executeSql() just to mark the statement bogus,  
&quot;marking the statement bogus&quot; is only a flag that takes effect later  
during the transaction effects.

Therefore, why is it so necessary to prepare the statement before the  
transaction is opened?  Why don't we parse and validate the statement  
in the transaction steps themselves?

If we adopted both of these models (Tims idea and allowing the  
statement to be parsed in the transaction steps) and there was a  
problem with opening the transaction itself, you'd get the  
SQLTransactionErrorCallback and the statement would never even be  
touched at all.

Thanks,
~Brady
