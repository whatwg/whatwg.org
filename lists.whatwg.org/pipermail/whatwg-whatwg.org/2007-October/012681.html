Right, the spec basically defines that as failed DNS, 4xx, 5xx, or 
similar.

And for the manifest, &quot;offline&quot; even means &quot;doesn't have 
text/cache-manifest MIME type&quot;, which we need to ensure that you don't 
screw up everything when in a captive portal. Note that the opportunistic 
caching namespaces don't handle a captive portal well -- they would end up 
caching the portal and not letting it get uncached until the next update. 
That's actually quite bad. Maybe we need a way to get around this? Should 
it not cache things that redirect off the domain or something? (Captive 
portals usually do their work by redirecting.)


&gt;<i> &gt; Then, the document must be loaded. If, during load, an application=&quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute is found, then, if a cache with that manifest URI already 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exists, then, add the resource URI to that cache, and associate the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsing context with that cache. If no cache exists for that manifest 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URI, then create a cache for that manifest URI, and add the resource 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URI to that cache. (XXX How do we handle &lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt; PIs? XXX)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't understand this bit. I thought that if you had found an 
</I>&gt;<i> application cache during the previous steps, you load the resource from 
</I>&gt;<i> that cache and then start the update in the background. I don't get 
</I>&gt;<i> what's going on here with checking the document for the application 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute and then adding it to the cache.
</I>
Does the current spec answer your question or are you still confused?


&gt;<i> &gt;  * Swap in the newest cache without a reload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This implies that the application can decide when to swap the new cache 
</I>&gt;<i> in, but I don't think that's true. For example, if a user decides to 
</I>&gt;<i> open a new window with the application, then the cache will get swapped 
</I>&gt;<i> in right? Even though none of the apps chose that.
</I>
Each browsing context has individual control over which version of the 
cache it's using. There can in fact be multiple different versions of the 
cache at any one time.

Well, it's not XML, for one...

They get propagated.

</I>
Can you give an example of a scenario in which problems would occur? I'm 
not sure I really can see the problem.

Indeed.
