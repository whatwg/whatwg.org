The spec has since been updated to include the ability for client-side UI 
to be shown (using the &quot;controls&quot; attribute).


&gt;<i> I maintain, therefore, that the following two things should be catered 
</I>&gt;<i> for by the spec in addition to what's already there:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * By default, browsers are expected to provide at minimum a play/pause 
</I>&gt;<i> toggle button which does not interfere with the size of the movie. (This 
</I>&gt;<i> implies that it must be some kind of overlay, ensuring that the size 
</I>&gt;<i> given by the page author is the size that the video will actually play.)
</I>
This is allowed, though not required.


&gt;<i> * An attribute is provided to disable the default buttons so that apps 
</I>&gt;<i> providing their own branded UI don't end up with confusing interfaces.
</I>
This is now present (though the attribute has to be specified to have 
controls appear).

I fear overloading forms so far.

This seems redundant, why not just have:

   &lt;video src=&quot;some_file.ogg&quot; controls/&gt;

...?

Indeed.

Indeed, scripted controls are still available.

The spec allows user agents to expose controls even when page-provided UI 
is present.


&gt;<i> I have no interest in enabling or even suggesting the use of the silly 
</I>&gt;<i> DVD type controls where you can't fast forward through the ads or the 
</I>&gt;<i> FBI notice.

Hear hear.


&gt;<i> &gt; c) it allows for cross-browser standardization.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is *not* a good thing. Browsers will and should be wildly

</I>&gt;<i> present the controls that make sense in its environment.
</I>
To some extent this is true, but there is clearly demand for authors 
controlling the user experience (or at least influencing it).

At the end of the day, if the video is provided in a decodable form, the 
user can do what he wants, even if it isn't necessarily easy.

Agreed.

It's not clear to me that scriptless controls would provide enough control 
to the author.

</I>
It's not clear to me what the advantage of just moving the controls around 
would be. Typical examples of custom UI today are far more involved.


Please let me know if the current spec text is adequate.
