Ok. Done.

What you're saying is that the attribute name is non-intuitive, not that 
the spec is ambiguous.

I agree. Changed as noted above.


&gt;<i> Now, I am suggesting:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> loopCount -&gt; playCount
</I>&gt;<i> currentLoop -&gt; playIndex || currentPlayIndex || currentPlayCountIndex
</I>
I have left this one for now. I don't like index, for reasons discussed 
below.

For me this counts as a point against -- the selectedIndex identifies an 
item in a list, whereas here we are identifying a general period of time.

I don't think loopFrom and loopTo is necessarily better than loopStart and 
loopEnd.

Are you ok with the new names?

</I>
I'm not sure that loopCount = 0 is clearer than playCount = 1. In fact I 
think people get confused over loopCount too much, however it works.
