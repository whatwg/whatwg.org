Indeed there is, as Lachlan almost immediately pointed out:

Not much I can add to that.

Actually both are redefined to be media-independent in HTML5.


&gt;<i> &gt; but there is an attempt to redefine the small element with some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantic meaning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If that is true, then I encourage the WHATWG to use another name, such 
</I>&gt;<i> as &lt;FINEPRINT&gt;ASDF&lt;/FINEPRINT&gt;. It is a lot longer, but it does convey 
</I>&gt;<i> more semantics.
</I>
As was pointed out in the original thread, the name doesn't convey 
semantics, the element and its definition do.


&gt;<i> A semantic markup language can't possibly have every single type of 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic out there. There are some cases that are so rare, that it would 
</I>&gt;<i> be a waste to define them.
</I>
Certainly.


&gt;<i> Sometimes &lt;BIG&gt; really does convey something. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;I said, &quot;&lt;BIG&gt;NO!&lt;/BIG&gt;&quot;.&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;YES!!&lt;/BIG&gt; I will do it!&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;NO!&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt; You will not!&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;YES!!&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt; I will do it!&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;NO!&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt; You will not!&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;YES!!&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt; I will do it!&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;NO!&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt; You will not!&lt;/P&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;P&gt;&lt;SMALL&gt;Oh, alright...&lt;/SMALL&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</I>
As was later pointed out, &lt;em&gt; is the appropriate element here. Shouting 
is an extreme kind of stress emphasis.


&gt;<i> I suppose that you could argue that CSS would create the same effect, 
</I>&gt;<i> but you shouldn't have to use CSS to create the effect of a shouting 
</I>&gt;<i> match. Besides, those words would have to be surrounded by elements, 
</I>&gt;<i> anyways, so it wouldn't hurt to use an element that has a default style. 
</I>&gt;<i> There is nothing wrong with using a non-semantic element that has a 
</I>&gt;<i> default style as opposed to &lt;SPAN class=&quot;shout&quot;&gt;YES&lt;/SPAN&gt;.
</I>
There is one problem, which is that user agents incapable of showing the 
original element's default style (e.g. a text mode browser with no font 
size control, or a speech browser, or a braille browser) has no guidance 
as to what to do with the contents. On the other hand, using a semantic 
element like &lt;em&gt; allows the user agent to intelligently substitute the 
original recommended rendering with an equivalent rendering that it can 
render on its medium.


&gt;<i> The problems of the past arose because:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) people used the wrong semantic elements
</I>&gt;<i> 2) people used non-semantic elements where there were semantics
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the above scenario, there are semantics, but there are no semantic 
</I>&gt;<i> elements to convey shouting.
</I>
I disagree; &lt;em&gt; is appropriate here.


&gt;<i> The elements are modifiable by CSS. I suppose that we could nest 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;STRONG&gt; a few times, but I don't recognize strong emphasis as the same 
</I>&gt;<i> thing as shouting.
</I>
&lt;strong&gt; in HTML5 represents importance, so I agree that it is not 
appropriate here.


&gt;<i> Also, it might be helpful to use &lt;BIG&gt; for math problems, without having 
</I>&gt;<i> to resort to MathML.
</I>
Mathematics are indeed a thorny problem. It's unclear that &lt;big&gt; would go 
far enough in solving it though.

</I>&gt;<i> No, you're using a presentational element where a suitable semantic

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;Oh, alright...&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> em { font-size: larger; }
</I>
Indeed.

In HTML5 &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; are orthogonal in definition.

Right.

Indeed.

Indeed.

CSS doesn't define meaning, only presentation.
