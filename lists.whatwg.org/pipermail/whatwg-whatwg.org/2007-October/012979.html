<PRE>&quot;When the current playback position of a media element changes (e.g. 
due to playback or seeking), the user agent must run the following 
steps. If the current playback position changes while the steps are 
running, then the user agent must wait for the steps to complete, and 
then must immediately rerun the steps. (If one iteration takes a long 
time, this can cause certain ranges to be skipped over as the user 
agent rushes ahead to &quot;catch up&quot;.) &quot;

Perhaps the parenthesized comment could be prefixed:  (These steps 
are taken as often as possible or needed;  if one iteration takes a 
long time, ...)?  Just a thought.

&quot;3.	If none of the cue ranges in current ranges have their 
&quot;active&quot; boolean set to &quot;false&quot; (inactive) and none of the cue ranges 
in current ranges have their &quot;active&quot; boolean set to &quot;true&quot; (active), 
then abort these steps. &quot;

one rather suspects that &quot;other ranges&quot; is  intended for the second test?

&quot;5.	If there are any cue ranges in other ranges that have their 
&quot;active&quot; boolean set to &quot;true&quot; (active) and have their &quot;pause&quot; 
boolean set to &quot;true&quot; as well, then immediately act as if the 
element's pause() method had been invoked. &quot;

Does the pause boolean add much over the exit handler?  It seems that 
if the exit is because of a seek, it might be kinda odd to 
immediately pause again?
