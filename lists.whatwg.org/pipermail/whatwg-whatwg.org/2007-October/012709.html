<PRE>On Wed, 21 Mar 2007, Robert Brodrecht wrote (in response to Apple's 
proposal, quoted):
&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the presentation of timed media by the user agent has been disabled, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the resource has an unsupported type, or if the preparations for its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presentation fail either because of a protocol failure or because the format
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the media is unrecognized, the user agent must fire an error event on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; element and display the element's fallback content, if available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, we have some fallback control.  That is good, as it is lacking from 
</I>&gt;<i> WHAT WG at the moment and was something I'm concerned about.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> how I intuitively felt it should work.  I'm glad that is specified.
</I>
The way the &lt;video&gt; element now works in the HTML5 proposal is not quite 
this -- the fallback is only used if the browser doesn't support &lt;video&gt; 
at all, not if it doesn't support the codec. The primary reasons for this 
is to stop the bouncing around of content. This is similar to how &lt;iframe&gt; 
works. Fallback to different formats is provided via &lt;source&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; The controller attribute is a boolean attribute. If the attribute is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present, the user agent must display a user interface which allows the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user to control the media element. The height attribute on the element 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not include the size of the controller, it is the size of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video element only
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like being able to specify this, but the height of the controller needs to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Be set normatively in this specification.  If the height of the 
</I>&gt;<i> controller area changes across browsers, it's going to be a source of 
</I>&gt;<i> irritation for developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Be set in CSS (as well as positioning options... I'd guess through a 
</I>&gt;<i> pseudo element like :controller?).
</I>
We'll address this in the rendering section in due course.


&gt;<i> &gt; When the src attribute is set, the user agent must immediately begin 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to download the specified resource unless the user agent cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support video/audio, or its support for video/audio has been disabled
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One reason I like YouTube is that the download is user-initiated.  If I 
</I>&gt;<i> include YouTube content on my site, they see a nice thumbnail from the 
</I>&gt;<i> video and a big play button.  If they are on dial-up, they don't have to 
</I>&gt;<i> download it.  Autodownload, to me, is flawed.  I know I can set up the 
</I>&gt;<i> image and video stuff with JavaScript to work like YouTube.  But if the 
</I>&gt;<i> user DOESN'T have JavaScript on, they are stuck with nothing.  I would 
</I>&gt;<i> love to see an &quot;autodownload&quot; attribute to complement &quot;autoplay&quot; or use 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;autoplay=0&quot; to disable the auto download.  A way to add a thumbnail 
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice while not auto downloading.
</I>
The spec has an autoplay=&quot;&quot; attribute now, and can stall downloading the 
content for as long as the user desires.


&gt;<i> &gt; The DOM attribute currentRate is the rate at which a media element is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently playing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guessing this would be in frames per second?  Is it the frames per 
</I>&gt;<i> second it is playing or the available frames per second encoded in the 
</I>&gt;<i> video?
</I>
In the spec it's a multiple of the native rate.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looping is useful for more presentational uses of video. Start and end 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time are useful in case you want to package a bunch of small bits of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video in one file and just play different segments, similar to the way 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content authors sometimes have one big image and use different 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subregions. Or consider looping audio, or a single audio file with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple sound effects. These are two examples.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could the looping be done via javascript rather than having explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> support for it with loopStartTime, etc? If an event is raised when the 
</I>&gt;<i> video reaches endTime then event handler could then restart it.

</I>
The spec now does it declaratively.

Right.
