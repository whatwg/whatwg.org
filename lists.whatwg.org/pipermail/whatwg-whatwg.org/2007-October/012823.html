Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to me to stop playing when a node is moved 
out of the document. I'd even say that it should never autostart based 
on its DOM attributes unless it is in the document. In other words, the 
only way you could get it to play when outside the document would be 
through an explicit call to play().

This does leave the problem of what happens if the element is garbage 
collected while it's playing sound. It'd be nice to hear what experience 
opera has here.

I would be a little hesitant to say that elements that play are never 
garbage collected. That would make it easy for the page author to 
accidentally leak &lt;video&gt;s without sound and muted-but-playing 
&lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt;s for the duration of the page. This sucks up both CPU 
cycles and memory.

One alternative would be to simply garbage collect them, but put a 
warning in the JS console whenever a playing element is garbage 
collected, aiding debugging.
