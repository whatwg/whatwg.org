One difference is that the database is persistent.  If the DOM became
corrupted, and you refresh the page or restart the browser, there's a
good chance that your DOM will no longer be corrupted.  If your
Database is corrupted and you refresh the page or restart the browser,
your Database is still corrupted.

You almost need an &quot;oncorruption&quot; handler (or maybe something more
general).  Detecting that a database is corrupt from within an
individual statement's callback really isn't all that interesting,
there's nothing statement-specific that you'd want to do at that
point.  But your oncorruption handler could do things like delete the
corrupt database and the three other databases which no longer make
sense without it, and reload the page.  The default handler could just
delete the database in question.
