I am not authoritative, but I have not seen any disclosures myself.

</I>&gt;<i>My understanding is that at least conceptually an audio description

</I>&gt;<i>who knows more about the production of audio descriptions, please,

</I>&gt;<i>sound track (in that case Speex would be appropriate) or whether the 
</I>&gt;<i>main sound must be manually mixed differently when description is 
</I>&gt;<i>present?
</I>
Sometimes;  but sometimes, for example:
* background music needs to be reduced
* other audio material needs to be 'moved' to make room for audio description


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and several caption tracks (for different languages),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think it needs emphasizing that captioning (for the deaf) and 
</I>&gt;<i>translation subtitling (for people who can hear but who can't follow 
</I>&gt;<i>the language) are distinctly differently in terms of the metadata 
</I>&gt;<i>flagging needs and the playback defaults. Moreover, although 
</I>&gt;<i>translations for multiple languages are nice to have, they 
</I>&gt;<i>complicate UI and metadata considerably and packaging multiple 
</I>&gt;<i>translations in one file is outside the scope of HTML5 as far as the 
</I>&gt;<i>current Design Principles draft (from the W3C side) goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think we should first focus on two kinds on qualitatively 
</I>&gt;<i>different timed text (differing in metadata and playback defaults):
</I>&gt;<i>  1) Captions for the deaf:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Written in the same language as the speech content of the video is spoken.
</I>&gt;<i>   * May have speaker identification text.
</I>&gt;<i>   * May indicate other relevant sounds textually.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Don't indicate text that can be seen in the video frame.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Not rendered by default.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Enabled by a browser-wide &quot;I am deaf or my device doesn't do 
</I>&gt;<i>sound out&quot; pref.
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Subtitles for the people who can't follow foreign-language speech:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Written in the language of the site that embeds video when 
</I>&gt;<i>there's speech in another language.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Don't identify the speaker.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Don't identify sounds.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Translate relevant text visible in the video frame.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Rendered by default.
</I>&gt;<i>   * As a bonus suppressible via the context menu or something on a 
</I>&gt;<i>case-by-case basis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>When the problem is frame this way, the language of the text track 
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't need to be specified at all. In case #1 it is &quot;same as 
</I>&gt;<i>audio&quot;. In case #2 it is &quot;same as context site&quot;. This makes the text 
</I>&gt;<i>track selection mechanism super-simple.
</I>
Yes, it can often fall through to the &quot;what content did you select 
based on language&quot; and then the question of either selecting or 
styling content for accessibility can follow the language.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Personally, I'd be fine with a format with these features:
</I>&gt;<i>  * Metadata flag that tells if the text track is captioning for the 
</I>&gt;<i>deaf or translation subtitles.
</I>
I don't think we can or should 'climb inside' the content formats, 
merely have a standard way to ask them to do things (e.g. turn on 
captions).

&gt;<i>  * Sequence of plain-text Unicode strings (incl. forced line breaks 
</I>&gt;<i>and bidi marks) with the following data:
</I>&gt;<i>    - Time code when the string appears.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Time code when the string disappears.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Flag for positioning the string at the top of the frame instead 
</I>&gt;<i>of bottom.
</I>&gt;<i>  * A way to do italics (or other emphasis for scripts for which 
</I>&gt;<i>italics is not applicable), but I think this feature isn't essential.
</I>&gt;<i>  * A guideline for estimating the amount of text appropriate to be 
</I>&gt;<i>shown at one time and a matching rendering guideline for UAs. (This 
</I>&gt;<i>guideline should result in an amount of text that agrees with 
</I>&gt;<i>current TV best practices.)
</I>
This should all be out of scope, IMHO;  this is about the design of a 
captioning system, which I don't think we should try to do.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It would be up to the UA to render the text at the bottom of the 
</I>&gt;<i>video frame in white sans-serif with black outline.
</I>
Or wherever it's supposed to go.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think it would be inappropriate to put hyperlinks in captioning 
</I>&gt;<i>for the deaf because it would venture outside the space of 
</I>&gt;<i>accessibility and effectively hide some links for the non-deaf 
</I>&gt;<i>audience.
</I>
Yes, generally true!
