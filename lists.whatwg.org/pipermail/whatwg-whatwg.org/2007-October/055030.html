Fixed.

</I>
Actually that's what we want -- the method is intended for when you want 
to change the schema of the database. First you want to wait for all 
outstanding changes to be committed, and then you want the schema to be 
changed.

</I>
Yeah, that should have been &quot;if the expected version is the empty string&quot;.

Fixed.

The idea is that you might not know what the version is (say, because some 
rogue code changed the version to a random string), and you want to go in 
and fix it. You need a way in.


&gt;<i> It may be worthwhile to allow the version to be an array.  Then the app 
</I>&gt;<i> could easily say &quot;Open this database, and here is the set of versions I

</I>&gt;<i> runs through the open calls catching exceptions, but it seems like 
</I>&gt;<i> something reasonable to just bake into the API, because if you have 
</I>&gt;<i> database versioning, you're almost certainly going to have multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> outstanding database versions (unlike with a server-side app, you have 
</I>&gt;<i> little control over when a client executes your app).
</I>
We could do that. I'm a little wary of adding arrays everywhere though. 
What do other people think? Is this worthwhile?
