Yes, I wish it were this simple, but 
unfortunately, this doesn't cut it, in two 
respects.  (a) Users needing accessibility go 
crazy if they have to turn it on, resource by 
resource, by hand.  (b) Users needing some kinds 
of accessibility (e.g. visual assistance) have 
trouble with things like &quot;right-click and choose 
a menu&quot;.

I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to use 
persistent preferences, if the spec. stays out of 
the field of trying to guess what all the axes 
(possibilities) are.  We've previously talked 
about
captions
high-contrast video
audio description of video
high-contrast (clarity) audio

and then the iPlayer comes along and has 'sign 
language' as another axis, which confirms that we 
can't think of all the axes up front.
