I agree completely.  The debate is not whether transactions speed up  
batch queries.  It's whether they slow down individual queries - which  
I have evidence saying they do.
My point is that if we can all end up agreeing it is a performance  
hit, then it is an agreed upon mark against the *implicit* transaction.

&gt;<i> The performance case for not using implicit transactions for server
</I>&gt;<i> databases is that it can allow for more concurrency.  If the client
</I>&gt;<i> sends a statement to the server without an enclosing transaction, the
</I>&gt;<i> server can minimize the amount of time the transaction has the
</I>&gt;<i> database/table/row locked.  If the client has to open the transaction,
</I>&gt;<i> that means a minimum of two additional round trips back to the client
</I>&gt;<i> are introduced (and much worse, if either the client or server are
</I>&gt;<i> very busy).
</I>
I'm also concerned about this - the same will be true with SQLite  
(minimizing the amount of time a write lock is maintained on the  
database file)

&gt;<i> For an embedded database like SQLite, things are different.  In that
</I>&gt;<i> case, no matter what, you're going to pay a big cost for fsync.
</I>&gt;<i> Making the transaction explicit will have an impact, but I'm really
</I>&gt;<i> surprised that you're seeing 5%.  I would bet that you're doing BEGIN
</I>&gt;<i> rather than BEGIN IMMEDIATE, which means that your 5% is probably down
</I>&gt;<i> to upgrading your database locks.  If so, that can be worked around by
</I>&gt;<i> implementing the spec using BEGIN IMMEDIATE rather than BEGIN
</I>&gt;<i> DEFERRED.
</I>
I will run more detailed numbers on this later, but a quick 1-off on  
changing it to BEING IMMEDIATE still indicates a measurable slowdown,  
between 1% and 2%

&gt;<i> For the current spec, concurrency isn't a huge issue, because
</I>&gt;<i> everything will be serialized at some level anyhow.
</I>
Nothing in the current spec forces 2 different browsing contexts from  
operating concurrently, resulting in the possibility of their own  
transactions stomping each other.

&gt;<i> [Sorry, don't mean to sound like I'm flip-flopping.  My concerns about
</I>&gt;<i> implicit transactions aren't really performance related. :-).]
</I>
My concerns about them are more than just performance related ones.  A  
forced performance penalty just drives me mad ;)
