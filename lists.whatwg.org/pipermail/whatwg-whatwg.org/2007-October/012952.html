Assuming that we'll need a blacklist even before the feature exists seems 
like admitting that the feature is flawed, which is a good sign that we 
shouldn't include it, IMHO. :-)


&gt;<i> I could even see there being a way to enable full screen for a site via

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Meaning, there might be a way to do it even if the spec doesn't say

</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, if the setting exists, it's far easier to trick users into 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setting it than if it doesn't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Out of curiousity, is an automatic switch to full screen without the 
</I>&gt;<i> user's consent considered an annoyance/usability problem or a 
</I>&gt;<i> security/fishing attack/vulnerability problem or both?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, it's only the former IMO.
</I>
The former, yes.


&gt;<i> Not that it matters, much, but with WMP, a script can use 
</I>&gt;<i> SetDisplaySize(3) to automatically switch to fullscreen without the 
</I>&gt;<i> user's consent. You can do the same with the videolan plugin using 
</I>&gt;<i> player.video.fullscreen = true. No warnings or anything.
</I>
Noted.


&gt;<i> If someone does ask why scripts can't switch to full screen, what would 
</I>&gt;<i> the reason(s) be?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. There doesn't seem to be much demand for it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It's not clear what would be the best way for UAs to provide the 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality while preventing sites from taking advantage of the 
</I>&gt;<i> feature and annoying users.
</I>
Both, and also that it's considered ok for the user to have to tell the UA 
that he wants to go fullfreen (rather than the script having to tell the 
UA that the user wants to go fullscreen).
