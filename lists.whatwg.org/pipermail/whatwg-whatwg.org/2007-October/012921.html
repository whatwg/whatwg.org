<PRE>
Last November, as part of the feedback on the W3C HTML WG charter, I wrote 
an e-mail [1] saying that I thought a realistic timetable would have a 
first working draft released in October 2007.

We don't really need archived copies with the way the WHATWG works, since 
everything happens in the open with a Subversion interface and everything, 
but, I figured that I should &quot;publish&quot; an archived copy anyway, so today I 
put out a frozen &quot;call for comments&quot; draft:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/multipage/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/multipage/</A>

If anyone was hoping for a semi-stable version to start reviewing the 
draft, I would say that this is it. We're pretty much feature-complete at 
this point, which is to say I don't think we'll be adding any major 
features to HTML5 going forward (though of course minor features like 
additions to certain APIs are likely to still occur).

There is a public issues list:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/issues/">http://www.whatwg.org/issues/</A>

...which has about 3700 issues in it. The next order of business is simply 
to go through all of those issues. I've been tracking the issue count 
since early October, and at the moment the count is reducing at a rate of 
about 7 a day, which works out to being about a year and a bit of solid 
work, which puts us on track to reach Last Call in 2009, as I predicted in 
the aforementioned e-mail.

I'd like to thank everyone here in the WHATWG community for helping make 
this work fun and pleasant. It's really nice to be able to work in such a 
friendly atmosphere. I hope the coming year will continue the same way!
