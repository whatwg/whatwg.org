I'd like to somehow request that this point be stressed in the specification.

I haven't spoken often, but I'm working on a browser for the Nokia 770
and Nokia N800. The 770 has very little local storage, but most likely
there will be a version of the browser we're producing that will
include this SQL API. I haven't done the math, but I think it amounts
to something like room for not more than 5 website databases with 5mb
each and a chance of failing to commit a changeset fairly often.

A couple of questions along these lines:
1. user launches browser
2. user visits Gmail
3. Gmail sets up a database
4. network goes out of range (transition to offline)
5. user composes and saves a message as a draft
6. user quits browser
7. browser saves database to disk
8. user launches browser
9. user visits Gmail
10. user sends the message
11. user connects to network (transition to online)
12. Gmail sends message
13. Gmail performs SQL operation to remove unsent message from in
memory database
14. SQL API reports that this transaction has successfully completed -
against an in memory database.
15. network goes out of range (transition to offline)
16. Device reboots (buggy wireless driver, effectively, the Browser
has crashed without saving updated database to disk, last save was at
point 7).
17. User launches browser
18. User visits Gmail
19. User opens the draft
20. User changes the draft
21. User saves the message
22. user connects to network (transition to online)

At which points in these steps should something interesting happen
that I haven't documented?

Note: the file system for internal storage is Flash, we have been
given explicit orders not to write to it frequently, as such Disk
Cache is disabled in our browser, because otherwise we'd be writing to
it frequently. From experience with a device with syslog, it turns out
that the results of constantly writing to the device are fairly bad
(10% used internal storage, device takes well over a minute to boot,
normal boot time is much faster).

That's the first use case, it's actually not the one I was planning to
write, but hey.

&lt;clicks save now&gt;

version two.

A couple of questions along these lines:
1. user launches browser
2. user visits Gmail
3. Gmail sets up a database
4. network goes out of range (transition to offline)
5. user composes and sends a message
6. user quits browser
7. browser saves database to disk

8. user launches browser

user visits 4 other web based applications that successfully create databases.

9. user quits browser
10. browser saves databases (5) to disk

11. user launches browser
12. user visits some other web application
13. web application tries to create a database.
14. browser panics (defined below)

User is given a dialog that lists what?
At best, what information is available to the user?
A. The name of each web application that has a database
B. The name of the database
C. The date/time at which it was last used
D. The date/time the application was last used with a network connection
 ** The browser is probably unlikely to be able to distinguish a
walled garden (technically term, definable on demand) network from a
proper network (with internet/intranet access to the application)
unless someone defines an API for a web application to be able to tell
the web browser &quot;Sorry, this network doesn't work for me&quot;.
E. Size of the database (which will make virtually no sense to the user)
F. Number of write transactions made against the database since the
last online state (this will be useless because an application could
either write often in small increments or rarely in a large chunk)

What options does the user have? Here are the ones I can think of:
A. Delete a database
B. Refuse to allow this new application database access
Bi. Remember this decision
Bii. Perhaps my browser should always ask the user about database
access, as it might be better for an application not to offer the
feature if the user is likely to need it for other things, even before
the user reaches full state, otherwise they might accidentally delete
something important.
C. Try to backup a database to the external RS-MMC
Ci. Is this backup or atomic export. I believe it should be atomic export.
D. Import a database from a file (i.e., RS-MMC) - currently disabled,
limit reached.

For fun, MMCs can easily be corrupted. So, in case people need a
reminder about this....

E. Create database on current external RS-MMC (again, use case is 770
which only supports RS, the n800 supports more flavors). Corrupting a
removal RS-MMC is trivial, just remove it during a write :) -- note,
this is corrupting the file system, I understand that a database
engine can claim that its writes will never create a corrupt database.
F. Let the user try to open one of these web applications and give the
application an event &quot;database is being deleted, please generate a
serialized export&quot;. The web application could then generate a query,
construct the actual useful part and trigger a file download that the
user can then save. Or the application could inform the user that it's
safe to delete the database, or give the user a list of relevant items
that will be lost.

&gt;<i> - Some action is taken to reset the database so that it is usable -
</I>&gt;<i> lets pretend the resolution is always recreating an empty database
</I>&gt;<i> from scratch
</I>&gt;<i> - The script knows something wrong happened - it has a completely 100%
</I>&gt;<i> generic error on its query.
</I>
Supposing at my second set, step 14, Gmail was open and the user chose
to delete the database, would it be convenient to send an event to
Gmail saying that the database has been deleted?

&gt;<i> But it is unaware of the nature of this
</I>&gt;<i> event and its resolution.  It decides to execute a new sql statement,
</I>&gt;<i> and the value of this statement (from the script's perspective) is
</I>&gt;<i> reliant on previously established values in the database.  The
</I>&gt;<i> statement coincidentally succeeds even with the new empty database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For further argument, lets pretend the script is in an onunload
</I>&gt;<i> handler and its writing some small piece of data out to the database
</I>&gt;<i> before the user &quot;quits&quot;.  It has a lot of other data in memory client-
</I>&gt;<i> side that it *thinks* is in the database, but really isn't anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> It *could* write this data out, preserving a lot of important user
</I>&gt;<i> state.  But it doesn't know to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One can certainly make the argument that if this were a native
</I>&gt;<i> application saving data to disk, it would be prudent to verify its
</I>&gt;<i> data on disk.
</I>&gt;<i> But I think &quot;raw filesystem&quot; and &quot;database&quot; are different paradigms
</I>&gt;<i> with different usage expectations.
</I>&gt;<i> An error code along the lines of &quot;your database was just reset&quot; might
</I>&gt;<i> fit the bill.  This could be because of corruption, because the user
</I>&gt;<i> agent database management was invoked and the database cleared, or a
</I>&gt;<i> number of other reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a requested split from code 1 - &quot;The statement failed for
</I>&gt;<i> reasons not covered by any other code.&quot;
</I>
