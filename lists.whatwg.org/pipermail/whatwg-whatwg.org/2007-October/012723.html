</I>&gt;<i> Typical case: the client requests a media resource via a transfer

</I>&gt;<i> playback until enough of the resource is cached for playback to proceed 
</I>&gt;<i> without interruption. Seeking is limited to the range of the media 
</I>&gt;<i> that's available locally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Data is loaded on demand in response to a request to perform an 
</I>&gt;<i> operation, e.g. play or seek
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Typical case: in response to a request to play a media resource, the 
</I>&gt;<i> client negotiates with a server to initiate a streaming session, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> an rtp session. Playback proceeds as soon as a minimal amount of data is 
</I>&gt;<i> buffered. Seeking may occur within the full range of the media; when it 
</I>&gt;<i> occurs the client asks the server to stream from the new media time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course many variants and elaborations of these two strategies are 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. In particular I don't mean to suggest that file transfer 
</I>&gt;<i> protocols are suitable only for the former category or that streaming 
</I>&gt;<i> protocols are suitable only for the latter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the discussions that led to Apple's proposal for media states we made 
</I>&gt;<i> an effort to accommodate a variety of media access protocols. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, in order to permit appropriate restrictions on seeking 
</I>&gt;<i> operations we expose the notion of the range of media that's available, 
</I>&gt;<i> not the range of media that's buffered, and leave the definition of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;availability&quot; up to the UA to accord with the transfer protocol and 
</I>&gt;<i> caching scheme in use. We also tried to stay away from the term 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;download&quot;, as it implies a file transfer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly the two broad classes I mention above are very general; would it 
</I>&gt;<i> be helpful to discuss player behaviors in more depth? How well does the 
</I>&gt;<i> current proposal succeed in allowing custom controllers to be

</I>
As far as I can tell, both of the cases above are in fact handled by the 
current specification. Could you elaborate on how you think the current 
spec is too restrictive?
