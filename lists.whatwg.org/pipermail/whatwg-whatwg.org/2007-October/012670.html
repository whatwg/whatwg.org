</I>
If the delivery is streaming, or in some other way where the 
selection of tracks can be done prior to transport, then there isn't 
a bandwidth hit at all, of course.  Then the &quot;ask this resource to 
present itself in the captioned fashion&quot; is a reasonable way to do 
this.

Alternatively, as you say, one might prefer a whole separate file 
&quot;select this file if captions are desired&quot;.

Our proposal covers both cases, as both have valid uses.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>When the problem is frame this way, the language of the text track 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>doesn't need to be specified at all. In case #1 it is &quot;same as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>audio&quot;. In case #2 it is &quot;same as context site&quot;. This makes the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>text track selection mechanism super-simple.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yes, it can often fall through to the &quot;what content did you select 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>based on language&quot; and then the question of either selecting or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>styling content for accessibility can follow the language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't understand that comment. My point was that the two most 
</I>&gt;<i>obvious cases don't require a language preference-based selection 
</I>&gt;<i>mechanism at all.
</I>
I am trying clumsily to agree with you. Content selection based on 
language, and then choice of any assistive needs (e.g. captions) can 
be orthogonal.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Personally, I'd be fine with a format with these features:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  * Metadata flag that tells if the text track is captioning for 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>the deaf or translation subtitles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I don't think we can or should 'climb inside' the content formats, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>merely have a standard way to ask them to do things (e.g. turn on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>captions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree. However, in order for the HTML 5 spec to be able to 
</I>&gt;<i>reasonably and pragmatically tell browsers to ask the video 
</I>&gt;<i>subsystem to perform tasks like &quot;turn on captions&quot;, we need to check 
</I>&gt;<i>that the obviously foreseeable format families (Ogg in the case of 
</I>&gt;<i>Mozilla and, apparently, Opera and MPEG-4 in the case of Apple) are 
</I>&gt;<i>able to cater for such tasks. Moreover, browsers and content 
</I>&gt;<i>providers need to have a shared understanding of how to do this 
</I>&gt;<i>concretely.
</I>
Sure, agreed.  As this matures, we (Apple) will be looking at what it 
takes for the movie file format, and I'll raise the same questions 
about MP4 and 3GP.
