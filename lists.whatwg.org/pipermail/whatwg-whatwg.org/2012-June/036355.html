</I>&gt;<i> Hello, on every HTTP request your browser sends header called

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is sent to all domains wither your request is for an image, an html

</I>&gt;<i> Browsers support a value called navigator.language but it does not

</I>&gt;<i> interface then maybe it would be good to make one that reduces the 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of work that client side developers would need to do. [...]

</I>&gt;<i> index.html.fi, etc. You can see how we did that here: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-start-page/ubuntu-start-page/trunk/files/head:/www/9.04/">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-start-page/ubuntu-start-page/trunk/files/head:/www/9.04/</A>

I haven't added anything to expose this; it's not clear to me that it 
would actually be worth it in practice, since there doesn't seem to be 
much chance of many authors using it, the browsers don't really expose the 
relevant settings UI well, and pragmatically most sites that do 
translation are going to want to be shipping different bits in the first 
place for performance reasons (you don't want to wait a round-trip to get 
the UI strings, and you don't want to send all the UI strings, typically), 
so HTTP headers would be enough. However, I'd love to be proved wrong, so 
my recommendation would be to advocate this to browser vendors and see 
what they are willing to implement.
