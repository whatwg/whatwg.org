</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well you're never _required_ to. The client can always use the

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
I don't think we disagree on this point. That's why this feature allows 
the author to set the name, after all.


&gt;<i> &gt; Correct. That's intentional. If a victim server doesn't explicitly say 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the resource is an attachment, then we don't want to allow a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hostile server to trick the user into downloading the file at all. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not so much that the server can't specify the filename, so much 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as you can't say that the file should be downloaded in the first 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place. It should show a warning and let the user select the filename.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why?  No new security issues have been suggested, as far as I recall, in 
</I>&gt;<i> allowing links that trigger downloads cross-origin.
</I>
&quot;Thank you for wanting to play SuperHotExampleGame! To play our super hot 
example game, you must first _download this license file_ and upload it to 
our license verification server:

   [ No file selected  (Browse) ]  ( Upload license file... )

...where &quot;download this license file&quot; points to a confidential file, e.g. 
the user's bank account home page with their bank account number or some 
confidential project page on an intranet site or some such.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Similarly, sites show an image inline and have a separate link to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; download it.  For that link to use @download, C-D: attachment would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have to be applied to the images, which is clearly unwanted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Only if the image is cross-origin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On nontrivial sites, download links are *usually* cross-origin (eg. 
</I>&gt;<i> resources hosted on services like S3).
</I>
Why isn't C-D sufficient in these cases?

download=&quot;&quot; is only really useful for intermediate authors who don't have 
sufficient control over their servers to set headers.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If you really want cross-origin @download to be opt-in, then use a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; separate header for it (&quot;Allow-Forced-Downloads: *&quot;); don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; repurpose C-D like this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not repurposing, it's just using it for a case where before there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be a download but no given filename: now there can be a filename 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given in the markup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's repurposing Content-Disposition by using it to say &quot;this resource opts
</I>&gt;<i> into allowing cross-origin sites to specify filenames using @download&quot;.
</I>
No, it's using it to say &quot;this resource is an attachment&quot;. It's just that 
things that aren't attachments can't be downloaded from another origin.


&gt;<i> It's strange, and doesn't allow specifying filenames for C-D: inline, which
</I>&gt;<i> is also important.
</I>
That is supported also, as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> If you really think that allowing sites to trigger downloads and set 
</I>&gt;<i> filenames cross-origin has security issues, then use a separate header 
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;Allow-Forced-Downloads&quot; to make that statement; don't derive it 
</I>&gt;<i> from C-D. (But I don't know what security problem that is.)
</I>
I don't see anything wrong with using C-D here. We're using it exactly for 
its defined purpose. We're just more lax for same-origin downloads.
