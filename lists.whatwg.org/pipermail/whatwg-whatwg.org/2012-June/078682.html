 Right now, you're correct: Chrome does allow this named window discovery
when renderer processes are re-used.  However, we could probably look into
using a separate WebKit PageGroup when re-using a process so that names
stay local to their unit of related browsing contexts.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would be happy to see that happen, for the same reason as you (allowing
user agents to have one event loop or process per unit of related browsing
contexts).  I'm not sure how to interpret the current wording of the spec
in this case.

I do observe that Safari, IE, and even Opera currently allow windows in
unrelated contexts to discover named windows, though.  Just do a
window.open(&quot;foo.html&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;) from two independently opened windows and
they'll both target the same &quot;foo&quot; window.  As a result, making unrelated
browsing contexts inaccessible to each other would probably require changes
to most user agents.

I'm ok either way: allowing named but unrelated windows to be discovered or
not.
