</I>
I don't understand how to interpret your answer with respect to my 
question (and thus whether you think the spec should change, given your 
earlier statement).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These should only be warnings, not errors. The language &quot;Authors

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Warnings are generally not useful. Either something is fine and we

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From the implementation-side, the spec is wrong, it ranks native HTML

</I>
I do not understand what this means or why it is wrong.


&gt;<i> As a &quot;best practices&quot; note, it seems overly optimistic. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> situations with AT navigation where role conflicts do occur and/or 
</I>&gt;<i> redundancy in tagging is helpful.
</I>
Can you elaborate on this? Specifically, can you give an example of such a 
case that conflicts with what the spec says?


&gt;<i> I don't believe it is appropriate for HTML to place restrictions on ARIA 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM. It's does not reflect implementations. The HTML spec should only 
</I>&gt;<i> specify what the default mappings are for HTML elements to ARIA. Authors 
</I>&gt;<i> may be advised to test AT software with their product.
</I>
I don't understand what you mean.


&gt;<i> This statement is more in line with practice: &quot;Authors must test 
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility tree as part of development and usage of ARIA semantics.&quot;.
</I>
We can't really put normative conformance criteria on whether authors test 
or not, that's a bit weird...

</I>&gt;<i> Some wild guesses:

</I>
I agree that allowing a button to be reported as being a link is bad for 
accessibility. The spec currently allows this due to a W3C HTMLWG chair 
decision that I opted not to challenge.


&gt;<i> @disabled and aria-disabled may be used via reference with aria-controls.
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;range&quot; and role=slider for redundancy.
</I>&gt;<i> various styling tricks with css selectors.
</I>
Can you elaborate on these? In what way do they conflict with HTML?


&gt;<i> I've used role and/or redundant ARIA within the scripting environment to 
</I>&gt;<i> minimize calls in applications checking for roles. Redundancy doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> harm anything, I actively promote it, as it does help, sometimes.
</I>
I disagree with that premise, for what it's worth. Redundancy can lead to 
a number of problems; on the Web, in particular, it's common for 
redundancy to lead to cargo-cult authoring mistakes. For example, expert A 
writes a Web page with some redundant roles, author B copies markup from 
that page and changes it to suit their needs, but ignores the previously 
&quot;redundant&quot; bits and thus ends up with conflicting information instead of 
redundant information. Page ends up being sub-optimally accessible, 
because the previously &quot;redundant&quot; accessibility annotations now conflict 
with the page's real semantics, and are wrong.


&gt;<i> Ian has stated that warnings aren't very useful, he's looking for error 
</I>&gt;<i> or bust. That's confusing when it comes to ARIA testing, as it's more 
</I>&gt;<i> about the pragmatic effects of applying semantics and using a variety of 
</I>&gt;<i> ATs to test them.
</I>
It's all about the pragmatic effects always. I don't see how this changes 
things here. Maybe we understand the words &quot;error&quot; and &quot;warning&quot; differently?

</I>
ARIA doesn't have to be specified only from script, but if specified it 
should only be specified for things where the browser can't do a better 
job itself. So there's no point putting it on an &lt;input&gt; element, 
typically. You're only really going to need it when making custom widgets 
with &lt;div&gt;s. (There's a lot of ARIA roles you'd never need to use if you 
just used HTML correctly, IMHO.)

The benefits seem minor and insufficient to overcome the disadvantage of 
changing the spec again on this front, so I haven't adopted &lt;hsub&gt;.
