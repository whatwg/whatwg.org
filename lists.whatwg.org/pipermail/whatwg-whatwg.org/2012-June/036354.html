Since you are on top of this I have not changed the attribute name in the 
spec. Please do let me know if this ends up being a less tractable problem 
than it currently appears.

</I>&gt;<i> There has been some discussion on the w3c/whatwg mailing lists about how 
</I>&gt;<i> far we can mark up content with linguistic tags, such as marking word 
</I>&gt;<i> and/or sentence boundaries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my authoring of web apps, I often write a short manual into a hidden 
</I>&gt;<i> div, so that the vocabulary of my application can be processed by 
</I>&gt;<i> translation services such as Google translate. Having content in the DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> seems the most appropriate way to handle translation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like the group to consider the costs/benefits/alternatives to a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lang-&quot; attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> Such as &lt;span lang-role=&quot;sentence&quot;&gt;This is a sentence.&lt;/span&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The data- and aria- attributes have worked out well. We may want to make 
</I>&gt;<i> room for one more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such a structure could be used to markup typical subject/object/verb and 
</I>&gt;<i> clause sections; it could also be used to markup poetic texts as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> defined meanings of content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.omegawiki.org/Expression:orange">http://www.omegawiki.org/Expression:orange</A>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an &lt;span lang-meaning=&quot;DefinedMeaning:orange_(5821)&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> Now this, this is &lt;span
</I>&gt;<i> lang-meaning=&quot;DefinedMeaning:orange_(5822)&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In most cases there's no need to define sentence boundary, meaning or 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise. But, it'd sure be nice to have the ability to do so in a 
</I>&gt;<i> standard manner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend role, meaning and prosody/pronunciation as the primary 
</I>&gt;<i> targets. Character markup may be something to consider as it's come up 
</I>&gt;<i> in SVG (rotate) and in CSS before. Doing a span for each character is 
</I>&gt;<i> not practical, so we'd want a shorthand much as SVG has shorthand for 
</I>&gt;<i> rotate.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's the primary reason. &quot;services such as Google translate&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Google translate gets a little loose with some markup, to where the 
</I>&gt;<i> translated content may be placed outside the span tag.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such as: &lt;div id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;My potato is &lt;span&gt;hot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Some words can be ambiguous to the point that even a human reader may 
</I>&gt;<i> not know what the meaning is. It'd be great to have a mechanism to 
</I>&gt;<i> disambiguate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Speech markup is cool, I like it, but we can have something a little 
</I>&gt;<i> lighter or even have some interplay with prosody.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span&gt;You say &lt;span&gt;potato&lt;/span&gt;, I say &lt;span&gt;potato&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> (poteitoe, potahtoe)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. CSS markup has come up a few times for sentence, word and character 
</I>&gt;<i> boundaries. Language is not static, it is very much human, and enabling 
</I>&gt;<i> humans to markup their language is what HTML is all about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll put some effort in later this week to dig up a few threads on the 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS requests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Services should never touch data-*; I've had to put all my content 
</I>&gt;<i> into markup anyway. I've had to add id attributes so I can identify it 
</I>&gt;<i> when it's translated by the UA or other service. Since I've done all 
</I>&gt;<i> that work, it'd be really nice to have some more options to add in, such 
</I>&gt;<i> as disambiguation, part of speech and occasionally, pronunciation and 
</I>&gt;<i> translation suggestions.

Given the existence of solution that can address this already, I haven't
