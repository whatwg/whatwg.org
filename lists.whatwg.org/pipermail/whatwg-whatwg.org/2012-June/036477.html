<PRE>Hello and thanks for reading this message.

I start indicating that this message can be considered useless. I apologize
for this.

A few weeks ago I was in the chat #WHATWG, and asked how to send an email
to the list on a proposal to HTML5 (JavaScript).
I've taken a few days before sending this email, because I have been
investigating whether there was a similar project in production, and I've
seen one.

My proposal for HTML5 is to make it functional with Kinect, SoftKinetic,
Asus Xtion, and similar devices to interact with the web.
Logically, Kinect is the device most commonly used, would be ideal for this
proposal.

Kinect patent must be owned by Microsoft. I am informed that in HTML5,
there have been discussions on these issues of patents, so this aspect
could possibly be some kind of problem.
&gt;<i>From my point of view, it would sell more devices of this type. Surely even
</I>in future be replaced by webcams these devices more powerful and included
as standard on all computers.

Also, users would have an advance on the web. Because really, I mean just
to give you support to make gestures to browse the web, but for more useful
things.
I have some functions to the web, and see that are not being developed:

*- Online shopping or Online retailing:* Want to buy clothes, but do not
know what size you are using actually. Online stores may have an option to
run Kinect and scan your body to tell you the correct size for you, for
that article.We could even see if that shirt looks good on you or not.

*- Webs makeup/hair salon:* With face recognition, could learn/test
different makeup on the market. Obviously these products would be tested
virtually, and then could be purchased.

*- Webs fitness/rehabilitation:* While this can be considered as a
videogame, I see it more as an application. It would check if the person is
performing well exercise, getting not cause any injury. Rhythm of physical
exercise, and progress in their mobility.

*- Possible support for Canvas:* Interact with Canvas, via Kinect. Although
this can be done also with multitouch technology.

There are many ideas, but these are four simple possibilities that have
been happening while I was writing this text.

Currently being developed by *MIT*, a JavaScript library, called *DepthJS*.
It Allows Any Web page to interact With the Microsoft Kinect using
Javascript:

A few months ago that they do not update, and so far only allow web
browsing via gestures. I suppose that at the moment, not perform a body
scan to display it on screen in the browser.

Microsoft according to some reports, also being developed for Xbox 360, a
version of Internet Explorer with supports Kinect.

Well, with this information, you can become a situation of my proposal.

I apologize as said at the beginning of this text, if this proposal is
absurd, or not is functional in the HTML5 philosophy, and is better to have
a separate library as *DepthJS* for this.

I hope to know your opinion and read your comments.

Regards and thanks for reading this proposal. I hope to know your opinion
and read your comments.

Sorry for my English, I'm Spanish.
