contenteditable=&quot;&quot; is a low-level primitive for creating text editors. 
It's not clear to me that there is much to be saved by adding a single 
high level feature on top of this. You'd still have to do a ton of work to 
make the editor work.

We can still make it easier to write the code, though. In fact, as far as 
I can tell, it needn't be especially hard with existing specs:

   [contenteditable]:empty::before { content: attr(data-placeholder) }

This wouldn't work if there's stray &lt;br&gt;s, etc, but if that's the only 
problem here, we can provide new selectors for it, as some people 
suggested. I recommend bringing that up in the CSSWG.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. Should it be treated as if there is a text node in the editable

</I>
What if parts of the element are positioned, transformed, animated, have 
an SVG filter applied, constantly mutated via the DOM API, etc, etc?

I strongly disagree. &lt;input&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt; are high-level constructs, so 
it's fine for them to be defined by the UA's platform. But contenteditable 
is a very low-level primitive. We can't just punt on how it interacts with 
CSS; otherwise people will have no way to reliably make UIs with it.

Now there's a problem we should fix. Having five different representations 
of &quot;nothing&quot; seems like a terrible position for us to be in.
