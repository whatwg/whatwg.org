Oops, I found more e-mails on the thread to which I just asked for a use 
case, which gave a use case:

In general, I would view problems with the encoded volume of a video as 
equivalent to problems with animated GIFs being too fast, PNGs having the 
wrong colour profile, videos having the wrong brightness setting, etc. 
Which is to say, the right solution is to fix the content. If we go down 
the road of having &quot;fixup&quot; features in HTML, we are going to open a 
pandora's box of fixup features.

Now, we _should_ support features that let you do audio, video, and image 
manipulation: features like Web Audio where you can pan the channels, 
change the volume, etc; features like Canvas where you can adjust image 
brightness, etc. But I don't think those should be at the level of content 
attributes on &lt;video&gt; to adjust the audio of poorly encoded videos. That 
doesn't scale.

Indeed.
