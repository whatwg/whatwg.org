 &gt; These are fair answers, but I can't help but think that the problem
 &gt; is critical enough to warrant spec-level consideration.

Oh, yes.  The question is how to spec this in a way that doesn't 
overconstrain future implementations to behave suboptimally.

 &gt; I think you've rightfully pointed out that the lazy-loading idea
 &gt; probably won't fly with vendors and could even cause problems in
 &gt; certain cases.

I think it would be quite doable and the spec should be changed to allow 
it.  I'm just not sure that the spec should _require_ it in all cases, 
because we can end up in situations where simply detecting whether 
something should be lazy-loaded or not is more expensive than just 
loading it.

 &gt; Even assuming that implementing this feature would mean delaying CSS
 &gt; prefetching until the metaviewport tag was parsed, wouldn't the
 &gt; tradeoff in page loading speed be worth it?

It depends on the use cases....  Consider a page that has no &lt;meta 
viewport&gt; at all (i.e. most of them).  Your proposed change right above 
would disable CSS prefetching altogether on such a page, which is pretty 
undesirable.

 &gt; Thanks again and if you feel this isn't the proper forum for
 &gt; addressing this issue, do you have any suggestions where I should
 &gt; take it?

This list is the right forum.
