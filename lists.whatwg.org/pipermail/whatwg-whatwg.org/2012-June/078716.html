The way the process here works is that Hixie reads these emails agrees 
that the change is a good idea (hopefully; in this case it seems likely 
since we seem to have three implementors in agreement) and it happens. 
There isn't any need for seperate proposals.

Of course it is also possible to file a bug if you want to track this 
specific point. (I sort of thought I had already filed a bug here but I 
can't find it now so maybe I imagined it).

(aside: your mail client seems to be mangling quotes in plaintext mail. 
This makes your replies very hard to follow).
