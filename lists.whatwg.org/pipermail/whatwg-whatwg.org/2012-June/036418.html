</I>
I've adjusted the definition of HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA to include this case. You 
have to have at least the conditions of HAVE_FUTURE_DATA (i.e. you have to 
be able to move at least one frame if play() is called), but beyond that, 
if you are in a state where waiting longer isn't going to help, you can 
just jump to HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA and fire the event.

(The goal of the state and event is for apps to know how long to wait, so 
obviously if waiting longer isn't going to be helpful then it makes no 
sense to not fire the event.)

I have indeed not required that.
