&gt;<i> I start indicating that this message can be considered useless. I apologize
</I>&gt;<i> for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few weeks ago I was in the chat #WHATWG, and asked how to send an email
</I>&gt;<i> to the list on a proposal to HTML5 (JavaScript).
</I>&gt;<i> I've taken a few days before sending this email, because I have been
</I>&gt;<i> investigating whether there was a similar project in production, and I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal for HTML5 is to make it functional with Kinect, SoftKinetic,
</I>&gt;<i> Asus Xtion, and similar devices to interact with the web.
</I>&gt;<i> Logically, Kinect is the device most commonly used, would be ideal for this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kinect patent must be owned by Microsoft. I am informed that in HTML5,
</I>&gt;<i> there have been discussions on these issues of patents, so this aspect
</I>&gt;<i> could possibly be some kind of problem.
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view, it would sell more devices of this type. Surely even
</I>&gt;<i> in future be replaced by webcams these devices more powerful and included
</I>&gt;<i> as standard on all computers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, users would have an advance on the web. Because really, I mean just
</I>&gt;<i> to give you support to make gestures to browse the web, but for more useful
</I>&gt;<i> things.
</I>&gt;<i> I have some functions to the web, and see that are not being developed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *- Online shopping or Online retailing:* Want to buy clothes, but do not
</I>&gt;<i> know what size you are using actually. Online stores may have an option to
</I>&gt;<i> run Kinect and scan your body to tell you the correct size for you, for
</I>&gt;<i> that article.We could even see if that shirt looks good on you or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *- Webs makeup/hair salon:* With face recognition, could learn/test
</I>&gt;<i> different makeup on the market. Obviously these products would be tested
</I>&gt;<i> virtually, and then could be purchased.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *- Webs fitness/rehabilitation:* While this can be considered as a
</I>&gt;<i> videogame, I see it more as an application. It would check if the person is
</I>&gt;<i> performing well exercise, getting not cause any injury. Rhythm of physical
</I>&gt;<i> exercise, and progress in their mobility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *- Possible support for Canvas:* Interact with Canvas, via Kinect. Although
</I>&gt;<i> this can be done also with multitouch technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are many ideas, but these are four simple possibilities that have
</I>&gt;<i> been happening while I was writing this text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently being developed by *MIT*, a JavaScript library, called *DepthJS*.
</I>&gt;<i> It Allows Any Web page to interact With the Microsoft Kinect using
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/doug/depthjs">https://github.com/doug/depthjs</A>
</I>&gt;<i> A few months ago that they do not update, and so far only allow web
</I>&gt;<i> browsing via gestures. I suppose that at the moment, not perform a body
</I>&gt;<i> scan to display it on screen in the browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft according to some reports, also being developed for Xbox 360, a
</I>&gt;<i> version of Internet Explorer with supports Kinect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, with this information, you can become a situation of my proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize as said at the beginning of this text, if this proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> absurd, or not is functional in the HTML5 philosophy, and is better to have
</I>&gt;<i> a separate library as *DepthJS* for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to know your opinion and read your comments.
</I>
The ability to capture sound and video from the user's devices and
manipulate it in the page is already being exposed by the getUserMedia
function.  Theoretically, a Kinect can provide this information.

More advanced functionality like Kinect's depth information probably
needs more study and experience before we start thinking about adding
it to the language itself.
