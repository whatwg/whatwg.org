Sounds good.  This is my first proposal to the group, so I wasn't
familiar.  Just didn't want to get too sidetracked from the main
feature, since I imagine there could be other opinions about narrowing
the scope of window names.

&gt;<i> Of course it is also possible to file a bug if you want to track this specific point. (I sort of thought I had already filed a bug here but I can't find it now so maybe I imagined it).

</I>&gt;<i> (aside: your mail client seems to be mangling quotes in plaintext mail. This makes your replies very hard to follow).

Sorry about that.  It seems to have come out ok in the web archive
(<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-June/036442.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-June/036442.html</A>),
but I'm trying Gmail's Plain Text mode here to see if that helps.
