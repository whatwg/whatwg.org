I'd like to see strawman proposals for resource description markup.

Presently, magnet+BitTorrent is the only mature and implemented tech in this field that I've found with wide support. And it's not even meant for adaptive streaming.

I know that markup for subtitles happened in this group. I'd like to see an effort for markup for resources, with the same experimental atmosphere.

The hope being that we can copy and paste some kind of text markup which describes various endpoints and metadata sufficient for streaming strategies for media.
