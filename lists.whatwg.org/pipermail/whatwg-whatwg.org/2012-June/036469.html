I've changed the spec to make removing an iframe from a document cause the 
nested browsing context to be discarded. (This includes when a node is 
moved from one place in the DOM to another.)

I couldn't find a browser that let iframes survive even being moved around 
the same document. (I was unable to test Opera or IE, though.)
