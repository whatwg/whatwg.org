</I>&gt;<i> symbols of physical quantities, and yet they are probably more common 
</I>&gt;<i> texts in general (as opposite to mathematics and programming) than the 
</I>&gt;<i> examples given.
</I>
I don't really understand why you don't think the text you quote doesn't 
cover symbols of physical quantities (also known as &quot;variables&quot; or 
&quot;constants&quot; depending on the specific symbol in question), but in the 
interests of moving on, I've made the spec redundantly unambiguous on this 
front by listing &quot;a symbol identifying a physical quantity&quot; explicitly.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; On the other hand, it seems that it doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t really matter. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;var&gt; element has now been defined to have such a wide and vague 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; meaning that it is pointless to use it. There is little reason to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; expect that any software will ever pay attention to &lt;var&gt; markup on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any semantic basis.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You seem to imply that there was reason to expect so before, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly news to me!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have rather been optimistic about future developments for markup 
</I>&gt;<i> elements that have been defined exactly enough to warrant meaningful 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics-based processing. For example, most of the uses mentioned in 
</I>&gt;<i> current text imply that &lt;var&gt; element contents should be kept intact in 
</I>&gt;<i> automatic language translation.
</I>
That continues to be the case, so I don't know why you conclude that using 
it is now pointless.


&gt;<i> &gt; I would not really expect these elements to be used for anything other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than styling hooks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That might be realistic, especially there is no significant semantic 
</I>&gt;<i> clarification in sight in general. This raises the question why we could 
</I>&gt;<i> not just return to the original design with some physical markup like 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;u&gt; together with &lt;span&gt; that was added later.
</I>
I think you'll find the &quot;original design&quot; of HTML isn't what you think it 
is (or at least, it's certainly not as presentational as you imply above), 
but that's neither here nor there. The reasons for eschewing 
presentational markup in favour of more semantic/structural markup are 


&gt;<i> What&#226;&#128;&#153;s the idea of wasting time in wondering which markup to choose, 
</I>&gt;<i> among several vaguely described alternatives, when it all ends up with 
</I>&gt;<i> being comparable to arbitrary author-named styles in word processing?
</I>
I would point you to this article:

   <A HREF="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/webpub.html">http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/webpub.html</A>

...but I think you probably already know of it.


&gt;<i> The advantage of using &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;u&gt; is that they have defined 
</I>&gt;<i> default rendering (even in the absense of CSS) and universal support in 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers.
</I>
That is _an_ advantage, yes. Not the only one.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So authors will use &lt;i&gt; if they think italics is semantically 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; essential, and &lt;var&gt; won&#226;&#128;&#153;t be used much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That seems to be the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So why not simply define &lt;i&gt; recommended and describe &lt;var&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;dfn&gt; as deprecated but supported alternatives?
</I>
What benefit does empty deprecation have? It's not like we can ever remove 
these elements altogether. What harm do they cause?

If we have to keep them, we are better served by embracing them and giving 
them renewed purpose and vigour, rather than being ashamed of them.


&gt;<i> This would make authoring simpler without any real cost. There&#226;&#128;&#153;s 
</I>&gt;<i> little reason to tell authors to use &#226;&#128;&#156;semantic markup&#226;&#128;&#157; if we don&#226;&#128;&#153;t 
</I>&gt;<i> think it has real effect on anything.
</I>
It does have an effect. It has many effects. It makes maintenance easier, 
it makes it easier to transition from project to project, it makes it 
easier to work on other people's markup, it makes it significantly easier 
to dramatically change a site's appearance, it makes it easier to create 
apply custom tools to extract information from the documents, it makes it 
easier for search engines to guess at author intent, it makes it easier 
for the documents to be repurposed for other media, it makes it easier for 
documents to be &quot;remixed&quot;, it makes it easier for JavaScript libraries to 
be used and mixed...


&gt;<i> &gt; However, some authors like the ease of maintenance that comes from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using elements as a general classification mechanism and classes to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide fine-grained control, and it is mostly for them that HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provides a variety of more specific elements like &lt;var&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This implies a burden on learning, teaching, and using HTML. Anyone who 
</I>&gt;<i> seriously tries to understand HTML will ask, for example, which of 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;var&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;dfn&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;abbr&gt; he should use in 
</I>&gt;<i> particular situations.
</I>
Indeed, which is why the HTML specification has been written with this 
audience in mind (amongst others). <A HREF="http://developers.whatwg.org/">http://developers.whatwg.org/</A> in 
particular presents the answers to those questions in various different 
ways for author convenience, and I encourage people to write further 
documents that build on these.

Honestly, the question of which element to use when is one of the least 
complicated questions new Web authors will face, despite our best efforts 
at keeping the Web simple to write for. Just look at, e.g., the new APIs 
for WebRTC.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Too bad there's no example of&lt;var&gt; used in programming context. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current wording suggests that it would be normal, when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussing programming, to write, say, &quot;Then we define the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variable &lt;var&gt;myFoo&lt;/var&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;fooType&lt;/code&gt; with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial value &lt;code&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/code&gt; - -&quot;, which really makes no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense, even if we use both &lt;var&gt; and &lt;code&gt; for myFoo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Why does it make no sense?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because &lt;var&gt; does not imply that the contents is computer code. Yet a 
</I>&gt;<i> variable name in programming is surely code if a type name or a literal 
</I>&gt;<i> is. And using &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;myFoo&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is clumsy, and it makes the 
</I>&gt;<i> text appear in italics by default, which is probably unsuitable 
</I>&gt;<i> (monospace italics doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t work well). Why would an author use markup 
</I>&gt;<i> that by default causes rendering that he does *not* want, when there&#226;&#128;&#153;s 
</I>&gt;<i> the option of using &lt;span&gt;?
</I>
The option is there if the author wants it. No author is forced to use any 
markup at all, just like we use none in this e-mail exchange.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Because it implies that in default rendering, identifiers of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; variables appear in italics whereas identifiers of types or classes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; do not. Why would anyone use extra &lt;var&gt; markup when it has no other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; implications than requiring extra CSS code to remove (when possible) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; italics?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To enable easier maintenance of the markup and easy self-documenting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; styling, same as pretty much all of HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t see how &lt;code&gt;&lt;var&gt;myFoo&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt; would ease maintenance 
</I>&gt;<i> and be self&#226;&#136;&#146;documenting, as opposite to e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;code 
</I>&gt;<i> var&quot;&gt;myFoo&lt;/span&gt;.
</I>
The benefit of &lt;code&gt; and &lt;var&gt; over &lt;span class=&quot;code var&quot;&gt; is that they 
are well-known names that future authors don't have to learn when they 
start working on your old project after you've moved on. The more 
knowledge like this that we can bake into the language, the easier 
transitioning between projects can become. Naturally there's a point of 
diminishing returns where the cost of knowing all the elements is higher 
than the benefit from having them; this is a balancing act that we must 
perform as part of designing the language.

&lt;code&gt; and &lt;var&gt; ease maintenance and are more self-documenting than 
solutions such as &lt;span class=&quot;style1&quot;&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;, which is what I assumed 
you were comparing this case to.

They are both cases of unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, 
non-textual annotations.


&gt;<i> What are the actual benefits of using &lt;u&gt; instead of &lt;span&gt;?

I presume you mean what is the benefit of:

   &lt;u&gt;

...over:

   &lt;span class=&quot;x&quot;&gt;

...for some arbitrary value of &quot;x&quot;. The benefits are as discussed above -- 
easier maintenance, easier for people to transition between projects, etc 
-- plus the extra benefit in this case of being far shorter. :-) It also 
leads to slightly cleaner-looking CSS. And there's the advantage you 
mention:

&gt;<i> The only difference is that with &lt;u&gt;, the default rendering on common 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers will use underlining.
</I>
This isn't the only advantage, but it is one, yes.


&gt;<i> This is the true meaning of &lt;u&gt;, and abstract, vague &quot;semantics&quot; will 
</I>&gt;<i> not help authors but confuse them.
</I>
I disagree, for the reasons on which I have expounded above.


&gt;<i> What is _compelling_ about markup for proper names in Chinese? HTML has 
</I>&gt;<i> had no markup for proper names in any language. Why introduce markup for 
</I>&gt;<i> them in one language, with the assumption that a specific rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> convention, now apparently rare, will be used?
</I>
This particular semantic is actually relatively common in that locale. For 
further discussion on this I recommend seeing earlier threads on this list 
or the Wikipedia page on the Chinese proper name mark.


&gt;<i> What is _compelling_ about markup for misspellings?
</I>
It's a feature that is necessary in text editors, for which we previously 
did not have a good solution.


&gt;<i> How many web pages use such markup and need it, and why is it compelling 
</I>&gt;<i> that &lt;u&gt; be available to them?
</I>
WYSIWYG text editors are becoming more and more common on the Web. For 
example, many blogs, social networks, CMSes, wikis, etc, have them.


&gt;<i> What is so _semantic_ about it if can mean Chinese proper name _or_ 
</I>&gt;<i> misspelled word?
</I>
It means &quot;unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual 
annotations&quot;. Those are just examples of such annotations.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; By reusing existing elements, we are able to support them without 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; having to wait for new elements to be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Several new elements have been added without such concerns.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, you are incorrect. The concerns were very much present.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was, for example, no support to &lt;mark&gt;. Maybe there is now, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> doubt. Why wasn't an existing element, like &lt;font&gt;, wasn't used for it?
</I>
We considered that (indeed, we tried various element names for what 
eventually become &lt;mark&gt;, including at one point &lt;u&gt;, IIRC). In the end we 
settled on &lt;mark&gt; because reusing at existing element did not provide a 
compelling advantage in the same way as it has for some of the other 
elements, e.g. &lt;small&gt;. Specifically, none of the existing elements had 
the default rendering we wanted, and no significant fraction of the sites 
that were working around the absence of &lt;mark&gt; used any particular element 
in a consistent way to encode that semantic.


&gt;<i> Which &quot;support&quot; was needed? Right, underlining. So what's so difficult 
</I>&gt;<i> in saying that &lt;u&gt; is just as semantic as &lt;span&gt;, except that &lt;u&gt; is by 
</I>&gt;<i> default underlined?
</I>
It's not difficult at all, it's just not as useful, and has disadvantages 
that are worth avoiding (e.g. suggesting that HTML is media-dependent).

There are other more subtle examples of element reuse in the contemporary 
HTML specification. For example, we now have XHTML2's &lt;section&gt;/&lt;h&gt; 
concept in HTML. However, instead of &lt;h&gt; we reused &lt;h1&gt;, because it had 
the right existing handling and default presentation. By careful 
construction of the outline algorithm, we were able to actually make this 
&lt;h&gt; element and the HTML4 &lt;h1&gt; element work in a completely compatible 
way, while leveraging existing implementation support.


&gt;<i> &gt; With &lt;u&gt;, many of the actual uses of the element can be seen as uses 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of both the old presentational meaning and the new media-independent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaning without conflict.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's because &quot;the new media-independent meaning&quot; has been formulated 
</I>&gt;<i> so vaguely that it can be ignored and the presentational meaning 
</I>&gt;<i> understood as the real one. But people who will try to take the text for 
</I>&gt;<i> real will get hopelessly confused (until someone comes to the rescue 
</I>&gt;<i> saying &quot;oh, &lt;u&gt; _really_ means underline&quot;).
</I>
I see no reason to believe that will occur to any significant degree.


&gt;<i> &gt; I would no more think we need an element for &quot;bolder&quot; than I would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think we need an element for &quot;louder&quot; in speech synthesis or an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; element for &quot;bigger hand gestures&quot; in sign-language interpretation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (not that I'm aware of a sign-language HTML UA, but there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fundamental reason one couldn't exist in the future). When you start 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the fundamental position that these media are no more important 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than each other, it is really hard to see why we would ever introduce 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;phrase-level typographic features&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>

It's the value of the href=&quot;&quot; attribute of the links in the &lt;article&gt;

The problem is that parsing in lists is highly unintuitive. For example:

   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Apple
    &lt;li&gt;Banana
    &lt;li&gt;Kiwi
    &lt;li&gt;Pear
    &lt;li&gt;Orange
   &lt;/ul&gt;

Now add &lt;div&gt;s:

   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Apple
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Banana
    &lt;div&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Kiwi
     &lt;li&gt;Pear
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Orange
   &lt;/ul&gt;

What do you think the DOM looks like?

Kiwi, Pear, and Orange are siblings.

Note that as it is specified, &lt;div&gt; can be used instead of &lt;p&gt; with 
basically no loss of semantics. (This is because the spec defines 
&quot;paragraph&quot; in a way that doesn't depend on &lt;p&gt;.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This shouldn't be necessary. It's a limitation of CSS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The right solution is for CSS to provide some pseudo-element or other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism that introduces an anonymous container into the rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree that wraps the elements you want to wrap.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this is a CSS problem. I think it's an HTML problem. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> not just that you might want to style definition items, you might also

</I>
You can do that by just putting the ID on the first one.


&gt;<i> Or pick them up and do interesting things with them via script.

Scripts have a concept of DocumentFragment and concept of DOM Ranges that 
make this kind of manipulation possible.


&gt;<i> But you can't do any of these three things because you can't wrap them

You do not need an element to do these things.

It's not a markup problem. If pseudo-elements are too complicated, then 
another solution should be found. There's no reason CSS has to be complicated.

It's highly confusing for a section heading to _not_ apply to text that

I won't deny that the situation with embedded data annotation syntaxes is

was written, RDFa and microformats did not sufficiently and effectively 
address the given use cases and there was no obvious way to evolve them 
that would solve the problems.

Language idealism is indeed a goal. It's just not the only goal, and

Sure you can:

Generally though I wouldn't recommend such markup. It's highly confusing

We actually do have a mechanism more like what you describe:

    &lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;John Smith&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;

...for instance, with a &lt;table&gt; around the whole thing. It allows pretty 
much arbirarily complicated two-dimensional data to be marked up.

&lt;dl&gt; itself is no longer defined in terms of &quot;definitions&quot;, by the way. 
It's definition is &quot;an association list consisting of zero or more 
name-value groups&quot;.

While it's true that the advice in the spec can lead one to wonder about 
whether one should put metadata in a &lt;footer&gt; which should then be in a 
&lt;header&gt;, I think, as Maciej suggests above, that that would lead to very 
confusing markup. The spec doesn't _require_ that bylines be in the 
&lt;footer&gt;. I've added a note to the spec to help clarify this.

It only actually gives one use: &quot;a span of text with an unarticulated,

What is bold, when you are using a screen reader, a speech synthesiser, a

All four of these, as described in HTML4, are gone.

There are three elements in HTML today that happen to have the same names
