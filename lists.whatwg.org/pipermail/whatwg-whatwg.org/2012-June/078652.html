</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The &quot;temporary&quot; implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; should probably be along the lines of &quot;reload the page, this time allowing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; all plugins&quot;.  As noted already in this thread, simply allowing plugins
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; after script has already tried to start them and communicate simply won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; work a lot of the time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not according to the model Adam suggested: a plugin that hasn't yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; received permission to start acts like a plugin that simply hasn't loaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's important to distinguish solutions for authors versus solutions for
</I>&gt;<i> UAs.  Authors should try and code according to Adam's model.  However, for
</I>&gt;<i> pages which don't, UAs may still need to direct users to reload the page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't support Glenn's suggestion to show a larger prompt when a plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; instance isn't visible, for two reasons.  One is that determining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; visibility it, in the limit, impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What matters is if the visibility detection is 1: web-compatible (matches
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up with what websites are doing with plugins that have in-page UI vs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; script-only plugins) and 2: well-defined, not whether you can detect that a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plugin is visible in every case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #1 may be impossible, though, especially if it's not known to the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in advance whether the plugin has UI.  It's probably better to just always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; show a prompt bar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not only that, but your point 2 again is only accurate when speaking of
</I>&gt;<i> pages where the authors are trying to work with click-to-play and thus are
</I>&gt;<i> ware of the visibility rules and take them into account.  However, the
</I>&gt;<i> feature needs to also work well with other sites which don't take these
</I>&gt;<i> rules into account, meaning that for those pages, you're reduced to the
</I>&gt;<i> non-computable case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second is that the purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this feature is generally to reduce annoyance; showing prompts atop the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; window is annoying, especially if it happens frequently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The entire purpose of those non-modal prompts is to be unintrusive and out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the way.  That style of prompting is designed exactly for this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a member of Chrome's UI team I can assure you that getting an infobar on
</I>&gt;<i> every page that has a blocked plugin leads to fury in about ten minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>  This is why our indicators are icons that appear in the &quot;page action&quot; area
</I>&gt;<i> of the Chrome omnibox.  This is unobtrusive enough to not be annoying.
</I>&gt;<i>  Unfortunately it's also unobtrusive enough to leave less-expert users
</I>&gt;<i> baffled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, pages should not be required to create placeholder areas inside pages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to give the browser a place to prompt; it's the browser's job to do that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for itself (again with prompt bars, doorhangers, and the like).  That's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially true because the page has no way of knowing whether the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is actually going to prompt (it may not use confirmations for the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being used, or the user may have clicked &quot;yes, always&quot; on a previous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session).  This belongs out-of-line.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's often easy for a page to give the plugin a temporary visible location
</I>&gt;<i> and hide it once the plugin actually loads, without the user noticing
</I>&gt;<i> anything in the common case where permission has been implicitly or
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly granted.  As I said, this isn't always possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PK
</I>

What about doing what popular plugin blockers do and offer the
notification in the area the plugin was intended to be used? I know it
won't work for all plugins (e.g. those too small or ones that don't
offer a visible area) but it would be intuitive in the main.
