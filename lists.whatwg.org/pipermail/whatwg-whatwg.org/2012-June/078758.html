<PRE>Thank you for your answer Tab Atkins.

Indeed, as you say, I see this as a proposal for the future. getUserMedia is
perfect for these features, as you indicate.

I will be alert to any news that occurs on this subject, for if I can
contribute something.

I think other proposals that may help improve the websites.

A greeting and thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I start indicating that this message can be considered useless. I
</I>&gt;<i> apologize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few weeks ago I was in the chat #WHATWG, and asked how to send an email
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the list on a proposal to HTML5 (JavaScript).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've taken a few days before sending this email, because I have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; investigating whether there was a similar project in production, and I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seen one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My proposal for HTML5 is to make it functional with Kinect, SoftKinetic,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Asus Xtion, and similar devices to interact with the web.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Logically, Kinect is the device most commonly used, would be ideal for
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kinect patent must be owned by Microsoft. I am informed that in HTML5,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there have been discussions on these issues of patents, so this aspect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could possibly be some kind of problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From my point of view, it would sell more devices of this type. Surely
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in future be replaced by webcams these devices more powerful and included
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as standard on all computers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, users would have an advance on the web. Because really, I mean just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to give you support to make gestures to browse the web, but for more
</I>&gt;<i> useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have some functions to the web, and see that are not being developed:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *- Online shopping or Online retailing:* Want to buy clothes, but do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know what size you are using actually. Online stores may have an option
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run Kinect and scan your body to tell you the correct size for you, for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that article.We could even see if that shirt looks good on you or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *- Webs makeup/hair salon:* With face recognition, could learn/test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different makeup on the market. Obviously these products would be tested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtually, and then could be purchased.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *- Webs fitness/rehabilitation:* While this can be considered as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; videogame, I see it more as an application. It would check if the person
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performing well exercise, getting not cause any injury. Rhythm of
</I>&gt;<i> physical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exercise, and progress in their mobility.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *- Possible support for Canvas:* Interact with Canvas, via Kinect.
</I>&gt;<i> Although
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this can be done also with multitouch technology.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are many ideas, but these are four simple possibilities that have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been happening while I was writing this text.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently being developed by *MIT*, a JavaScript library, called
</I>&gt;<i> *DepthJS*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It Allows Any Web page to interact With the Microsoft Kinect using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Javascript:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://github.com/doug/depthjs">https://github.com/doug/depthjs</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A few months ago that they do not update, and so far only allow web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsing via gestures. I suppose that at the moment, not perform a body
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scan to display it on screen in the browser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft according to some reports, also being developed for Xbox 360, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version of Internet Explorer with supports Kinect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, with this information, you can become a situation of my proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I apologize as said at the beginning of this text, if this proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; absurd, or not is functional in the HTML5 philosophy, and is better to
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a separate library as *DepthJS* for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope to know your opinion and read your comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ability to capture sound and video from the user's devices and
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate it in the page is already being exposed by the getUserMedia
</I>&gt;<i> function.  Theoretically, a Kinect can provide this information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More advanced functionality like Kinect's depth information probably
</I>&gt;<i> needs more study and experience before we start thinking about adding
</I>&gt;<i> it to the language itself.
