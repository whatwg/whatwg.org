So AFAICT the spec does require that this is prevented for unrelated 
browsing contexts, except in the case where the two are same-origin 
which is allowed but with some fuzzy condition about &quot;[if] the user 
agent determines that the two browsing contexts are related enough that 
it is ok if they reach each other&quot;. As far as I can tell only Gecko 
implements that and it seems reasonable that others wouldn't want to 
have behaviour that requires multiple event loops to interact (assuming 
one event loop per unit of related browsing context).

Therefore I think that part of the spec should be changed to only reuse 
the same named window within a single unit of related browsing context.
