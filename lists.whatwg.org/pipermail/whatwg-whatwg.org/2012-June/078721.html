</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I recently experimented with keyboard accessibility of media elements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I found that browsers don't provide a default tabfocus on media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements nor do they provide keyboard interactivity. I had to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explicit @tabindex attributes onto the media elements to allow them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least receive focus. This is particularly irritating in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screenreader.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As the video is specified right now, it is not a tabfocusable element
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1] and only interactive [2] when it has controls. This is sufficient
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for audio elements, which have no visual representation without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controls, but isn't right for video, which always renders at least a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poster (or a black area). Also, if there are controls specified, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should actually be tabfocusable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are in Opera. The spec allows it.
</I>
Yes, thankfully one browser has video keyboard interaction.

Video is not listed in the tabfocusable list, though. How does the
spec allow/encourage that?


&gt;&gt;<i> Even video without controls should allow keyboard focus and should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide for default keyboard interaction: at minimum it should allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for ENTER and/or SPACE to toggle play/pause - and clicking on it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should work, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Video without controls is expected to have author-provided controls.
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to squeeze in hard-to-discover invisible browser-provided controls in
</I>&gt;<i> that case would likely just confuse users and make authors curse browsers
</I>&gt;<i> and try to preventDefault() and tabindex=-1 their video elements (or switch
</I>&gt;<i> back to Flash) so that their own controls is what their users interact with.
</I>
Hmm... I guess so. The problem that I have is that it's not guaranteed
that there are accessible controls when there is no @controls
attribute. That means that screen readers don't even see the &quot;image&quot;,
nor would they provide access to the context menu, through which
&quot;play&quot; is usually possible. But maybe that's a bug on the
screenreaders rather than the spec - they should always have video as
an interactive element.


&gt;&gt;<i> Potentially it should have up/down arrows to change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the volume and left/right arrows to seek back/forward by e.g. 10sec.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As it's currently specified, browser cannot provide such interaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when there are no controls, since the element is not generally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified as an interactive element [2].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It can, actually. &quot;interactive content&quot; is just a category for the purpose
</I>&gt;<i> of the content model, it doesn't have implications like the above. (For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, if you have a &lt;video&gt; without controls attribute, and the user
</I>&gt;<i> enables the controls from the context menu, the element still isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;interactive content&quot; but it shows controls.)
</I>
That's a browser-specific hack, though, and not quite in the spirit of
the spec, isn't it?

Maybe the answer is in general: it's an implementation issue. However,
the spec doesn't really encourage such
implementations/interpretations. The spec should then say something
like: if there is a screenreader running or a context menu available
that provide for controls, then the elements are also regarded as
&quot;interactive content&quot;.

Thanks,
Silvia.
