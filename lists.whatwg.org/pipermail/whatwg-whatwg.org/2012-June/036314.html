Styles are not as generic as scripts. Styles are almost always very 
specific to the site, so you have control over them. Scripts on the other 
hand could be things like analytics, or be related to social widgets, or 
who knows what else. (I'll grant that maybe some of those embed style 
sheets which you might then want to enable, but I'd imagine most of them 
would do that inside iframes, not directly in your page.)

The point being that while I could see wanting to control things 
per-script (and I believe this is now specced out), I don't really see a 
compellingly similar story for styles or for making this completely 
generic.

Having said that, of course, if browser vendors implement it, I'll spec it...


(There were other e-mails on this thread but they did not seem to have any 
actionable feedback on the spec so I have not included them here.)
