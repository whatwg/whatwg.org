</I>
I'm not making a judgement here, I'm just letting you know how things 
stand. As far as the spec goes, I have to spec what will get implemented. 
If browser vendors feel a particular style of feature is too dangerous, 
there's no point me speccing it.

The Web pretty much is what you describe here, yes. The way it limits 
application developers to prevent them from doing things that are 
user-hostile is a huge part of the reason for its success.

</I>
That doesn't seem like a particularly compelling use case.

</I>&gt;<i> ultimately, I believe, better and more tailored user experience.
</I>
I think there's plenty of opportunity for experimentation and choice today 
already, with browsers written as native apps.


&gt;<i> I think such a recommendation as this also goes hand-in-hand with my 
</I>&gt;<i> earlier recommendation for the easy creation of shared databases which 
</I>&gt;<i> presumably unlike Shared Workers can persist outside of and be 
</I>&gt;<i> independent of the original application, and would allow extensibility 
</I>&gt;<i> for these browser-in-browsers (which we might call &quot;bibs&quot;)--as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> new life for &quot;Open Data&quot;.
</I>
You can share data today using an iframe and postMessage() to a common 
database provider.


&gt;<i> One could store the browsing history, for example, in such a shared 
</I>&gt;<i> database, which could in turn be accessed by other alternative bibs. 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially with experimentation on shared database formats, this could 
</I>&gt;<i> build confidence among users that the histories, bookmarks, cookies, 
</I>&gt;<i> data or documents saved for fast or aggregated local querying, or other 
</I>&gt;<i> personal data they are building would remain accessible to them on their 
</I>&gt;<i> machine even if they later chose another bib.
</I>
It's not clear to me that making any site be able to access my browsing 
history would be a win.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not talking about some module you have to build yourself in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; order to distribute a browser as an executable. I'm talking about 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; visiting a (secure/signed?) page on the web and being asked 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; permission to give it any or all powers including the ability to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; visit and display other non-cross-domain-enabled sites, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; long-term possibility of browsers becoming a mostly bare shell for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; installing full-featured browsers (utilizing the possibility for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; APIs for these &quot;browsers&quot; to themselves accept, integrate, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; offline-cache add-on code from other websites, emulating their own 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; add-on system).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do you help users who have no idea what that means and grant a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hostile Web site claiming to be a browser access to everything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you help users who are told &quot;Download this zip file and click 
</I>&gt;<i> this &quot;exe&quot; file&quot;?
</I>
iOS prevents it by preventing downloads altogether. ChromeOS and Android 
prevent it by preventing the user from executing arbitrary code. Mac OS 
and Windows display prominent warnings about the danger of such actions -- 
and that's not enough; witness the frequent malware attacks.


&gt;<i> Or, how do you help users who visit a site allowing malicious add-ons? 
</I>&gt;<i> No one has yet to explain the supposed difference to me in any 
</I>&gt;<i> satisfactory manner.
</I>
There is no difference, IMHO. You'll notice I haven't specified add-ons 
nor required that browsers implement the ability for the user to execute 
arbitrary code from the network with their user privileges.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I am not interested in the argument that &quot;It is just too dangerous&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Browsers already allow people to download executables with a couple

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is giving a dire warning only conceivable and potentially intelligible 
</I>&gt;<i> to users of web apps, yet not for this proposal?
</I>
The dire warning doesn't work. I'm just saying that's the direction that 
operating system vendors have been going in; that disallowing it in the 
browser case is not a different direction, it's consistent with the 
industry's direction as a whole.
