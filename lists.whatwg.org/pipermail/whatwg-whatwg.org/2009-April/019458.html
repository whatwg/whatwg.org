While this might have been better, I think that since IE8 and Opera have 
both implemented and shipped this, a change would have to be really 
compelling to be adopted. I'm not sure this is really compelling.

How is a fixed &quot;C:\fakepath\&quot; prefix not cross-platform and uniform?

</I>
We're forcing the specs to cover whatever is needed for an implementation 
to support legacy content.

In general I don't think we should be encouraging more use of IE's modes. 
They're a big enough mess as it is.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe someone from Opera could let us know which sites caused them 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to do this? Was it many, as with Microsoft?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What we apparently do not have here is cold, hard data. As you said on 
</I>&gt;<i> many other occasions, use cases need to be laid out clearly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since this (IMHO extremely confusing) inconsistent change will be 
</I>&gt;<i> enshrined for generations to come, I am against it - unless the number 
</I>&gt;<i> of (public !) sites is so big that we can't fix that problem otherwise.
</I>
I agree that better data would be great, but it's not clear how to find 
this data. File upload controls tend to be hidden behind password- 
protected pages and thus hard to discover.


&gt;<i> &gt; I followed their lead because I have found that speccing something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is already implemented is more effective than inventing new 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; syntaxes when it comes to getting implementations. In this particular 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case, it also seems that the &quot;./&quot; syntax wouldn't in fact fix the bugs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that were found.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fixing the buggy web pages would also fix stuff. Why can't this be part 
</I>&gt;<i> of IE compatibility mode?
</I>
I'd rather not have to spec additional modes as well.
