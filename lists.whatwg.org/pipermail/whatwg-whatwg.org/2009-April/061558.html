<PRE>Tab expressed my thoughts on this issue much better than I ever could. I did
want to follow up with a couple of notes.

I think the #1 goal for incognito mode has to be &quot;maximum compatibility&quot; -
let sites continue to work, which kills options #1 &amp; 2.
A secondary goal for incognito mode would be &quot;don't let sites know the user
is in incognito mode&quot; - this kills approach #1 and #5, and possibly #2
(depending on whether there are significant non-incognito use cases that
also have 0 local storage quota).

Given those goals, it seems like it leaves items #3 and #4 as the only
reasonable solutions. Yes, you can construct tortured scenarios where the
user enters data *while in incognito mode* which he expects to continue to
persist beyond incognito mode - I just don't see this as a serious problem.

</I>&gt;<i> assume their writes were successful.  #2 is probably the most
</I>&gt;<i> pernicious, as it will bite users hardest when the author is *just*
</I>&gt;<i> smart enough to do some basic error checking (such as testing for
</I>&gt;<i> quota size) before they start to use LocalStorage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those three, each in their own way, feel more technically correct than
</I>&gt;<i> #3 and #4, and so I perfectly understand why they seem attractive to
</I>&gt;<i> implementors.  But they *will* cause serious problems for users, and
</I>&gt;<i> they *will* prevent people from using private browsing on
</I>&gt;<i> badly-designed LocalStorage/Database-using sites (which will be a
</I>&gt;<i> large percentage of them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #3 and #4 are the realistic solutions here, both of which address the
</I>&gt;<i> problem while acknowledging the limitations of common author
</I>&gt;<i> abilities.  Which one is chosen is largely a matter of preference, and
</I>&gt;<i> aren't that significant.
