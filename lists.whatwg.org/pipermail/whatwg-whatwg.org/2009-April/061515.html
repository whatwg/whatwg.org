How are cookies handled right now?  Surely the issues should be pretty
much the same?

</I>&gt;<i> application thought was saved really wasn't.
</I>
I certainly can't think of how 3 could ever cause a problem.  It
should be the same as the user just logging in from a computer they
haven't used before, shouldn't it?

I'm not certain about 4.  What would be a concrete case where 4 would
break, but normal use from multiple computers would not?

I don't think 1, 2, or 5 are good ideas, since they make localStorage
semi-usable at best when privacy mode is enabled.
