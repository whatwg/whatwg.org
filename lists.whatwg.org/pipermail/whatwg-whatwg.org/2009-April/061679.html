</I>
SessionStorage doesn't ever close the session explicitly (though it 
commonly gets into situations where it can never be reached again, at 
which point the browser can &quot;reap&quot; it).

However, even if it did, that doesn't work -- there could well be other 
sessions (other windows entirely) that are logged into the same site.


&gt;<i> &gt; and false-negatives (a crash wouldn't log out the user).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think a responsible server implementation would use this *in addition* 
</I>&gt;<i> to session timeouts, not instead of them.
</I>
I think if we have as a use case making something that provides a better 
logout solution, it should fix the actual use case significantly better 
than existing solutions.


&gt;<i> &gt; Why do session cookies not address this already?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are still scenarios where it would be valuable for the 
</I>&gt;<i> server to know *exactly when* the user logged out. One example would be 
</I>&gt;<i> those &quot;XY is online&quot; badges you see in many internet forums today. 
</I>&gt;<i> Today, those have a margin of error of about 15 to 20 minutes at best.
</I>
In my own experience, closing the page is not a good indicator of when 
I've &quot;logged out&quot;. I often have tabs open that I'm not planning on 
returning to, and I often close tabs only to reopen them shortly after. I 
see the same behaviour with others. So it's not clear to me that this 
would really improve matters.


&gt;<i> With session cookies, if the client doesn't send more requests, the 
</I>&gt;<i> server after all has to guess if you logged out or if you're just taking 
</I>&gt;<i> your time. So you have to wait for a pretty long timeout period in any 
</I>&gt;<i> case. Even if a 15 minute timeout is not so much of a problem from a 
</I>&gt;<i> user perspective, it's still a lot of memory a (potentially buisy) has 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep around longer than really necessary.
</I>
It's not clear to me why keeping a user logged in should take significant 
memory, but maybe I don't understand the use case well enough. Could you 
elaborate? For most sites, a user would just be a row in a database, 
surely.


&gt;<i> You can't simply &quot;force-logout&quot; the user inside onunload either, because 
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;false positives&quot; above.
</I>
Depending on the situation, maybe a better solution would be for a shared 
worker to have a WebSocket connection to the server, and for the server to 
take the closing of the WebSocket connection as a logout. This addresses 
all the concerns like multiple tabs, timeouts, crashes, etc.

</I>&gt;<i> cookie, the logout would trigger immediately; if the client-side script 
</I>&gt;<i> knew the user is leaving the site, any cookie might be removed.
</I>
This seems like the better short-term solution, yes.


&gt;<i> But such wouldn't solve the server-side logout concern: to invalidate 
</I>&gt;<i> any login data, in the above scenario an expired cookie must be 
</I>&gt;<i> recieved, thus possibly giving a cookie thief a longer time to work. Of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, there are solutions to address that.
</I>
If there is a security concern, please use real encryption!
