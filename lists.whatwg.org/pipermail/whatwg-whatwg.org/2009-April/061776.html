<PRE>
I've taken note of the suggestions below in the source of the HTML5 spec, 
but not added them to the language yet. As we approach last call for the 
HTML5 spec, I am trying to reduce the number of new features added, so 
that we can stabilise the document and feature set and give implementors a 
fixed set of features to aim for.

 * Colours set by component
 * The equivalent of SVG's fill-rule
 * Line styles -- dashed and dotted lines
 * Points

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In that case, why not always return an array, like Philip Taylor 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; suggested? It would allow the user be able to read color values in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an easy way, and still keep compatibility with this kind of code :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;    var old = context.fillStyle;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;    context.fillStyle = 'green';
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;    context.fillRect(0,0,100,100);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;    context.fillStyle = old;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't see many reasons to return strings like #xxxxxx or rgba(...) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in the first place, but if needed, it's way easier for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; application to convert that array[4] to a rgba(...) or #xxxxxx 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; string than the other way around.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One reason to get back CSS values is that it makes it trivial to poke 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; values into CSS sheets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If CSS values are needed, it can still be converted quite easily:
</I>&gt;<i>    var col = context.fillStyle;              //get an array
</I>&gt;<i>    col.pop();                                //no alpha
</I>&gt;<i>    var css_col = &quot;rgb(&quot; + col.join(&quot;,&quot;) + &quot;)&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While parsing the current return values is way harder than that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But the real reason is that the attribute takes CSS in, so it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returning CSS colours is symmetric and unsurprising. (Surprises are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad in APIs.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can understand that, but if it can take an array in, returning an 
</I>&gt;<i> array is also symetric. BTW, behaving like an array would be more 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent with the way getImageData() and putImageData() work, 
</I>&gt;<i> returning an array of 4*w*h integer values between 0 and 255 (in that 
</I>&gt;<i> case, alpha could also be returned an integer).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My first attempt at using the element to support vector-based graphics 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produced by a program that dates back at least three decades was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually more difficult to implement in a &lt;canvas&gt; element that it was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on an HP pen plotter many years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even though I quickly became a fan of the HTML5 element because of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ease with which I could interface with standard HTML documents and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ECMAScript/JavaScript, I was surprised there was no built-in support 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for dashed lines, Hershey/vector fonts, even-odd polygon fill rules, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and points. And yet gradient fill patterns, opacity control, image 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manipulation, and complex clipping regions were all supported (which I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider more advanced graphic features than a dashed line!).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yet I found I could quickly create server-side applications or JavaScript
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functions that let me get around these problems. The document found at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html</A> shows some simple XY
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plots containing simple labels, dotted grids, and dashed lines. This was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; done with the help of a server-side library, but the functionality is all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very plausibly portable to JavaScript functions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But everyone does not have routines laying around to do sofware-based 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dash codes, ASCII text strings, and grids. However, it looks like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others have already raised these issues except for the topic of points 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (although I don't think anyone brought them up together, pointing out 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that they are all common elements of any simple XY-plot utility).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since the other topics have already been breached, I'll make my point 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about points!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is common practice in many graphic formats to represent a polyline 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; composed of a simple &quot;move2(x,y)&quot; or &quot;move2(x,y) draw2(x,y)&quot; as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point. Another common solution is to provide a marker(x,y,&quot;name&quot;,sz) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routine that can draw various markers at points.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is quite common for a technical plot to be a so-called &quot;scatter&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plot where the data is marked purely by marker symbols or points. It 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is also common to unpredictably have a polyline be just a single 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point. If dashed lines are going to be supported, it is important to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; note that almost all dash code models support points as part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dash-code pattern. Every graphing utility I can thing of supports 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dotted grids, and so on. Points are so common in technical plots that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I strongly prefer that a polyline that has no length is represented as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a filled circle with a diameter equal to the current line width or as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a square centered on the point with an edge length equal to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current line width.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Inconveniently, the current &lt;canvas&gt; standard says to ignore a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; polyline with no length. This means any code drawing simple curves has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to detect such lines and render them as circles or squares or give 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them a false non-zero length.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If others have reasons for not wanting to render lines with zero 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; length, perhaps the solution would be a new graphics state option that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would let you toggle between the two behaviors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other surprise was that there was no display list or object 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition capability. Simple plots usually don't make much use of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these, except to define a marker style, but I find them invaluable in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearly any nteractive program.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All that being said, I find the &lt;canvas&gt; element a welcome and overdue 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addition to the Web ( I actually liked VML better than either SVG or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PDF or CANVAS because there was a common editor, browser, and drawing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; utility immediately available that supported it, but I'm practical 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough to know VML is now destined to be a proprietary MS-centric 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; product).
