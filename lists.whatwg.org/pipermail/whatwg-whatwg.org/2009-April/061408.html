AFAIK every major browser has an implementation of localStorage close to
shipping. The only way I can imagine having a chance to put the brakes on
the feature now is for everyone who hasn't actually shipped it --- which I
think is currently everyone but IE, since we shipped the old &quot;globalStorage&quot;
which we're planning to rip out anyway --- to unite and disable it
immediately until we have a better API. Maybe we could even get IE to
disable it in an update.

Mozilla could probably get behind that, but I don't know who else is willing
to bite the bullet.

I suppose &quot;sessionStorage&quot; can stay?
