They are unspecified.  From this thread I have learned that Chrome and  
Firefox start with no cookies.  Safari starts with a snapshot of  
cookies at the point where the user entered private browsing mode.  I  
would not be surprised if Opera or IE8 were subtley different from  
either of these two approaches.

I strongly share Jonas' concern that we'd tell web applications that  
we're storing there data when we already know we're going to dump it  
later.  For 3 and 4 both, we're basically lying to the application and  
therefore the user.  Imagine a scenario where a user has no network  
connection and unknowingly left their browser in private browsing  
mode.  Email, documents, financial transactions, etc could all be  
&quot;saved&quot; locally then later thrown away before they've had a chance to  
sync to a server.

&gt;<i> I don't think 1, 2, or 5 are good ideas, since they make localStorage
</I>&gt;<i> semi-usable at best when privacy mode is enabled.
</I>
Apparently Firefox plans to implement #2, and so far I'm standing by  
WebKit choosing #5 for now.  Options 1, 2, and 5 all avoid the problem  
that 3 and 4 have which is that we're lying about saving data we have  
no intention to save.
