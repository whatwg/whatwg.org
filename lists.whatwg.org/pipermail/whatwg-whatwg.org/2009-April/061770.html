Done.


&gt;<i> I also suggest that speccing just serializability should be fine.
</I>
The problem is that this is specifying an &quot;anti-requirement&quot;, which 
doesn't really help in defining what the behaviour _should_ be like. It 
doesn't tell us what the order of events should be, for instance, just 
that some order should exist.


&gt;<i> It seems to me the current spec is proposing one implementation of

</I>&gt;<i> the black-box equivalence principle to enable other implementations. But 
</I>&gt;<i> specifying serializability is probably simpler and may allow

</I>
What kind of implementations are unintentionally ruled out that you think 
should not be ruled out?


&gt;<i> I think it's a lot like GC; we don't specify a GC algorithm, even though

</I>
It's explicit now, actually (see 2.9.8 Garbage collection, 5.3.5 Garbage 
collection and browsing contexts, 7.3.3.1 Ports and garbage collection, 
and similar sections in the Event Source, Workers, and Web Sockets specs).

It worked for as long as the HTTP override was around to override, but as 
soon as the user saves the file to disk, or some such, it fails.

It's massively simpler to not have to deal with the horrors of character 
encodings.


&gt;<i> Disregarding charset from HTTP headers is just a weird special case for

</I>&gt;<i> CSS, but keep appcache manifest going forward, it could maybe make

</I>
What's the advantage of introducing all the pain and suffering that 
encodings will inevitably bring with them to the cache manifest format?

IMHO RFC4329 is silly.

</I>
This API now exists.

I don't think it causes any particular serialization problems, the only 
issue seems to be what happens if a worker grabs the write lock to a 
database and then doesn't release it, but then all it will do is cause the 
browsing contexts that are waiting for that lock to just never call the 
relevant callback (and for the sync workers from that domain to block), so 
it doesn't seem like a huge deal. (It's still serialisable, it's just 
there's a big wait in there!)



&gt;<i> &gt; Re: cookies I suppose that network activity should also wait for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lock. I've made that happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like that would restrict parallelism between network loads and 
</I>&gt;<i> executing javascript, which seems like the wrong direction to go.
</I>
I agree that it's suboptimal, but given the desire for serializability, I 
don't know what to do about it.


&gt;<i> It feels like we are jumping through hoops to protect running script 
</I>&gt;<i> from having document.cookies modified out from underneath it, and now 
</I>&gt;<i> some of the ramifications may have real performance impacts. From a 
</I>&gt;<i> pragmatic point of view, I just want to remind people that many current 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers do not make these types of guarantees about document.cookies, 
</I>&gt;<i> and yet the tubes have not imploded.
</I>
...that we know of. As Robert pointed out, this is not a bug that will be 
reported, or if it is reported, not one that will mention the root cause.

I have had experiences with IE that have led me to not use IE as my main 
browser because of inexplicable annoyances and strange behavior which 
could well be some strange race conditions. I don't know.

That's what the (HTML5) spec requires now. (Well, it doesn't talk about 
reading, that's implicitly atomic.)

I've added a note to the spec that any calls into or out of a plugin also 
release the storage mutex.

Do you mean the phrasing in the spec should be changed?

</I>
Yeah, that might make sense. I'd rather get implementation experience from 
regular appcaches before adding more ways to invoke them though, lest we 
dig ourselves a hole too deep to climb back out of.
