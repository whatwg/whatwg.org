Having just converted a 200+ page document with a lot of in-lined code to 
HTML , I found myself
rather taxed by the limitations of &lt;code&gt; , so while I like your suggestion 
(which does seem
to appear in the draft spec [1]) , I need to offer some  observations of my 
own:

(disclaimer: I may well have been working on incorrect assumptions)
1. Having to type &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tagname&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; seemed a little bit 
silly to me:
is there a use case for *not* wanting &lt;pre&gt; when doing &lt;code&gt;? Could that 
not be handled as an attribute of the &lt;code&gt; if so?
2. having to escape &quot;&lt;&quot; as &amp;lt; in the middle of &lt;code&gt; seems like work for 
the author that could just as easily be handled by the browser. In the old 
days, &lt;xmp&gt; worked pretty well... why no replacement for its functionality??
3. trying to style a &lt;code&gt; so that it would have an indented margin, a 
border, a default font-style (monospaced), preserve within -line 
indentation, and work consistently across browsers seemed to defy my humble 
abilities with CSS. (see 
<A HREF="http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/cs427/StateOfArt-Dailey.html#test_file">http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/cs427/StateOfArt-Dailey.html#test_file</A> 
as an example of the very clumsy solution I ultimately opted for -- IE still 
doesn't preserve within-line indentation in this solution-- it used a styled 
table with a styled td and was particularly gross!.)
4. if we could just write
    &lt;code language=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;svg&gt;&lt;rect/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;,
it'd be nice to have the page render the HTML just as is.

5. Some of the good folks on either whatwg-irc or htmlwg-irc let me know 
that &lt;code&gt;&lt;p&gt;happy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was bad form, and that I should use 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; instead. It never would have dawned on me that the first was bad 
form, nor that the second would be good form. (maybe it should have dawned 
on me, but I speak html sorta like I speak english, more through habit than 
training, and not very formally at that). Second the introduction of &lt;p&gt; 
within &lt;code&gt; was actually generated by a robot that converted a bunch of MS 
Word to &lt;html&gt; so someone other than me must have thought it was a good idea 
to do it that way.

David
