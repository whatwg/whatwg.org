Everyone is free to implement their privacy mode as they see fit, but
if apps can trivially tell they are in incognito mode, as opposed to
running on a constrained environment (low quota, etc), then I think
that sort of defeats the purpose.  I don't want apps refusing to
operate because they detect incognito mode, incognito is about _me_
not trusting _them_, not them deciding that I can't be trusted because
I'm acting shifty.

When in incognito mode, well-behaved apps should already prompt you
before throwing huge amounts of data at you, just like they would if
you visited from a fresh browser install, so I think that's mostly a
non-issue.
