As far as I can tell, as specced, there isn't a race condition (other 
than the inherent network race condition).

<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#delay-the-load-event">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#delay-the-load-event</A>

In this case:

   &lt;body onload=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img onload=&quot;1; image = new Image(); image.src = 'test'; image.onload = 3&quot;&gt;

The main 'load' event is queued as soon as there is nothing left that 
depends on it -- which happens as soon as the &lt;img&gt; load event was queued 
up, but before it runs. So the handlers run in the order given (1, 2, 3).
