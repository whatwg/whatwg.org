getItem stability is helpful for read-only scripts but no help for
read-write scripts. For example, outside a transaction, two scripts doing
putItem('x', getItem('x') + 1) can race and lose an increment. Even for
read-only scripts, you have the problem that reading multiple values isn't
guaranteed to give you a consistent state. So this isn't much better than
doing nothing for the default case. (Note that you can provide hen read-only
scripts are easy to optimize for full parallelism using ) Forcing iteration
to be inside a transaction isn't compatible with existing localStorage
either.

Addressing the larger context ... More than anything else, I'm channeling my
experiences at IBM Research writing race detection tools for Java programs (
<A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=781528">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=781528</A> and others), and what I learned
there about programmers with a range of skill levels grappling with shared
memory (or in our case, shared storage) concurrency. I passionately,
violently believe that Web programmers cannot and should not have to deal
with it. It's simply a matter of implementing what programmers expect: that
by default, a chunk of sequential code will do what it says without
(occasional, random) interference from outside.

I realize that this creates major implementation difficulties for parallel
browsers, which I believe will be all browsers. &quot;Evil', &quot;troubling&quot; and
&quot;onerous&quot; are perhaps understatements... But it will be far better in the
long run to put those burdens on browser developers than to kick them
upstairs to Web developers. If it turns out that there is a compelling
performance boost that can *only* be achieved by relaxing serializability,
then I could be convinced ... but we are very far from proving that.
