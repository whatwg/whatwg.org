&gt;<i> OK... so if I am building an API, the consumer of my API might not realize

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. If sync XHR spins up a subsidiary event loop, the cookie lock is the
least of your worries, because event handlers may run and mutate arbitrary
script/DOM state. (We're actually tightening up what is allowed to run
during sync XHR in Gecko, but I don't know the details and I don't know what
other browsers do.)

APIs that can cause reentrancy, or block, or yield, need to be carefully
documented. That's why we want to minimize them...


&gt;<i> When deciding how to handle cookies in Chrome, we did not worry about the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem being debated here.  Our concerns were allayed by recognizing that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> IE does not try to solve it (and IE6 is multi-process just like Chrome with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a shared network stack), so clearly web developers must already have to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cope.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You mean IE8.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, IE6,7,8 (maybe older versions too?) ... you can launch multiple IE6
</I>&gt;<i> processes, and those share cookies.  You can also programmatically access
</I>&gt;<i> the same cookies via WinInet from any application.  It is not uncommon for a
</I>&gt;<i> separate application to be mucking around with cookies for intranet.com.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, that's interesting.


&gt;<i> How would Web developers cope? There's no way to synchronize. I doubt more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a handful of Web developers even know this problem could exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can synchronize through the origin server...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I meant was that they &quot;cope&quot; by not expecting document.cookie to
</I>&gt;<i> return the same results each time it is called.  I'd imagine it is not
</I>&gt;<i> uncommon for users to login to a site in multiple windows and perform
</I>&gt;<i> similar operations in each browser window.  That scenario seems like it
</I>&gt;<i> could trigger what we have here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Many sites, such as my bank, detect that and attempt to prohibit it by
refusing to let more than one window work. I wonder if they use a
race-vulnerable cookie protocol to detect it...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be best to specify that document.cookie returns a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> snapshot.  I think that is consistent with existing implementations
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> including IE, Firefox, and Chrome.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not at all. In Firefox, cookies don't change while a script is running, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long as it doesn't call the handful of blocking DOM APIs (such as alert() or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sync XHR); we satisfy the current spec.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why the sync XHR exception is taken so lightly.  As I
</I>&gt;<i> mention above, that is most frequently used as a
</I>&gt;<i> transparent-to-the-rest-of-the-application way of communicating with the
</I>&gt;<i> server (usually because some APIs cannot be easily changed or need to be
</I>&gt;<i> available during unload).  Yet, here we are saying that that cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> transparent because of this locking issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. Making sync-XHR &quot;transparent&quot; by reducing all consistency guarantees to
what we can provide around sync-XHR is the wrong direction to go IMHO.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The insidious part is that almost all the time, IE and Chrome will also be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> observed to obey the spec; when a quick cookie-read-modify-write script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runs, it is very unlikely cookies will change underneath it. (Is it possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people don't write such scripts?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure people write cookie-read-modify-write scripts and don't realize
</I>&gt;<i> the potential problems.  But I suspect the incidents of problems related to
</I>&gt;<i> two scripts doing so are extremely low as to not matter enough to
</I>&gt;<i> application developers.  They can just say:  opening our webmail program in
</I>&gt;<i> two browser tabs at the same time is not supported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If they're not aware of the problem, why would they say that?


&gt;<i> Maybe we need dynamic race detection for Web browsers. After a script reads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document.cookie, stall for a while to give network transactions or scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running in other threads a chance to change the cookies so the original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script carries on with wrong data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds interesting, but what happens when the script writes cookies?  Now
</I>&gt;<i> there is a merging problem :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Oh, dynamic race detection is only good for finding bugs more easily, not
fixing them :-).
