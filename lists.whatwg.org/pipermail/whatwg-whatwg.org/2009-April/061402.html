Double oops! Yes.

You mean throw an exception when it happens? Yeah, that doesn't really help,
you just replace one kind of random failure with another. A half-completed
read-write script is very likely to have corrupted data.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Addressing the larger context ... More than anything else, I'm channeling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my experiences at IBM Research writing race detection tools for Java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programs ( <A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=781528">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=781528</A> and others), and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what I learned there about programmers with a range of skill levels
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grappling with shared memory (or in our case, shared storage) concurrency. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passionately, violently believe that Web programmers cannot and should not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to deal with it. It's simply a matter of implementing what programmers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect: that by default, a chunk of sequential code will do what it says
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without (occasional, random) interference from outside.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I definitely see pro's and cons to providing a single threaded version of
</I>&gt;<i> the world to all developers (both advanced and beginner), but this really
</I>&gt;<i> isn't what we should be debating right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why not? I know of no better forum for debating the semantics of the Web
platform, and it's clearly a matter of some urgency.

What we should be debating is whether advanced, cross-event-loop APIs should
&gt;<i> be kept simple enough that any beginner web developer can use it (at the
</I>&gt;<i> expense of performance and simplicity within the browser) or if we should be
</I>&gt;<i> finding a compromise that can be kept fast, simple (causing less bugs!), and
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat harder to program for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone wants to cross the event loop (except in the document.cookie
</I>&gt;<i> case, which is a pretty special one), they should have to deal with more
</I>&gt;<i> complexity in some form.  Personally, I'd like to see a solution that does
</I>&gt;<i> not involve locks of any sort (software transactional memory?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree it would make sense for new APIs to impose much greater constraints
on consumers, such as requiring them to factor code into transactions,
declare up-front the entire scope of resources that will be accessed, and
enforce those restrictions, preferably syntactically --- Jonas' asynchronous
multi-resource-acquisition callback, for example. That is entirely
consistent with what I said above; I'm not saying all concurrency
abstractions are intractable. But the &quot;abstraction&quot; which takes sequential
code and adds races on shared storage everywhere certainly is.

Unfortunately we have to deal with cookies and localStorage, where the API
is already set.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I realize that this creates major implementation difficulties for parallel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsers, which I believe will be all browsers. &quot;Evil', &quot;troubling&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;onerous&quot; are perhaps understatements... But it will be far better in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long run to put those burdens on browser developers than to kick them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upstairs to Web developers. If it turns out that there is a compelling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performance boost that can *only* be achieved by relaxing serializability,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then I could be convinced ... but we are very far from proving that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, a LOT of research has been done on concurrency.  Basically, if
</I>&gt;<i> you're not really careful about how you construct your language and the
</I>&gt;<i> abstractions you have for concurrency, you can really easily back yourself
</I>&gt;<i> into a corner that you semantically can't get out of (no matter how good of
</I>&gt;<i> a programmer you are).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I know this, but I'm not sure exactly what point you're trying to make.
