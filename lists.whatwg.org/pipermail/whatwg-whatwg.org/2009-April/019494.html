</I>
Because it is indicative of a fundamental error. Calculations involving 
radii should never be able to go negative.


&gt;<i> Another example is:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you turn the molecule a bit, the circles disappear with a
</I>&gt;<i> INDEX_SIZE_ERR exception.
</I>
Why is this sometimes calculating negative radii?


&gt;<i> Isn't it better to just ignore the arc and go on with the drawing, like 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox does? And perhaps the same for arcTo?
</I>
There are three places where there are radii: gradients, arc(), and 
arcTo().

That's one option.

</I>
Well then why would there be a negative value?


&gt;<i> I'm just speaking of ignoring negative arcs instead of giving an

</I>
It's unclear why this would be better.

Generally most exceptions in the canvas API have been dropped; the only 
ones remaining are for cases where there really doesn't seem to be a good 
reason why you'd ever pass that value.


When faced with negative radii: Gecko throws an exception for arcTo(), 
ignores the call for arc(), and uses the magnitude of the radii for 
createRadialGradient(); Webkit throws for arcTo() and arc() and does 
something I couldn't understand for createRadialGradient(); and Opera 
throws an exception for all three.

I haven't changed the spec, which says to throw an exception for all 
three, since that's the change that results in the fewest changes to 
browser implementations.
