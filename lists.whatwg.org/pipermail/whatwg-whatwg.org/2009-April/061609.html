</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A difference with mobile phones is that when the phone=token you can

HTML5 is meant to specify every HTML feature that you need to  
implement a browser than can handle the real-world Web. At this point,  
anyone implementing a new browser engine would have to support  
&lt;keygen&gt;. However, none of this rules out the possibility of putting  
more advanced crypto functionality into browsers, either via HTML or a  
separate spec. So I would recommend that you focus on promoting your  
preferred solution rather than opposing &lt;keygen&gt;.

Maciej
