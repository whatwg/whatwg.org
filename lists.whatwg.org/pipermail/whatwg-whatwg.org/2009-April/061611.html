Microsoft would unlikely support something they already have a better (and by every CA product worth mentioning supported)  solution for.  This could IMO reduce the value of HTML5.

In addition to that, Mozilla's generateCRMFRequest () is superior to &lt;keygen&gt;; otherwise they wouldn't have added it, since Mozilla already had &lt;keygen&gt; through their Netscape heritage.

Anyway, the existing &lt;keygen&gt; will probably not survive so you end-up doing a major redesign.   One of the things that you MUST change is the GUI where *users* have to select key strength.  That's ridiculous, in the majority of cases it is the *issuer* that has a policy that it tries to enforce.   I doubt that &lt;keygen&gt; will come out as a simple solution if such considerations are taken in account.

OTOH, if the motivation is rather &quot;elevating&quot; Apple's *existing implementation* to full standard, then you are all set :-)

&gt;<i>However, none of this rules out the possibility of putting more advanced
</I>&gt;<i>crypto functionality into browsers, either via HTML or a separate spec. 
</I>
I'm happy about that :-)

&gt;<i>So I would recommend that you focus on promoting your preferred
</I>&gt;<i>solution rather than opposing &lt;keygen&gt;.
</I>
I just took my experience in this field and explained why *I* felt that &lt;keygen&gt; needed a successor.

If WHATWG took &lt;keygen&gt; to for example IETF-PKIX, a *real' standardization effort on this minor feature could easily take 2-3 years to complete!
