<PRE>That's interesting.  I'm not exactly clear what an &quot;incognito&quot; session  
starts out with.  Does it start without any cookies, for example?

</I>&gt;<i> A commonly added feature in browsers these days is &quot;private browsing  
</I>&gt;<i> mode&quot; where the intention is that the user's browsing session leaves  
</I>&gt;<i> no footprint on their machine.  Cookies, cache files, history, and  
</I>&gt;<i> other data that the browser would normally store to disk are not  
</I>&gt;<i> updated during these private browsing sessions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This concept is at odds with allowing pages to store data on the  
</I>&gt;<i> user's machine as allowed by LocalStorage and Databases.  Surly  
</I>&gt;<i> persistent changes during a private browsing session shouldn't be  
</I>&gt;<i> written to the user's disk as that would violate the intention of a  
</I>&gt;<i> private browsing session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's take the specific case of LocalStorage, which is what I am  
</I>&gt;<i> currently working on with WebKit.  In attempting to fix this bug I  
</I>&gt;<i> came up with a few possible solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - Disable LocalStorage completely when private browsing is on.   
</I>&gt;<i> Remove it from the DOM completely.
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - Disable LocalStorage mostly when private browsing is on.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> exists at window.localStorage, but is empty and has a 0-quota.
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - Slide a &quot;fake&quot; LocalStorage object in when private browsing is  
</I>&gt;<i> enabled.  It starts empty, changes to it are successful, but it is  
</I>&gt;<i> never written to disk.  When private browsing is disabled, all  
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the private browsing proxy are thrown out.
</I>&gt;<i> 4 - Cover the real LocalStorage object with a private browsing  
</I>&gt;<i> layer.  It starts with all previously stored contents.  Any changes  
</I>&gt;<i> to it are pretended to occur, but are never written to disk.  When  
</I>&gt;<i> private browsing is disabled, all items revert to the state they  
</I>&gt;<i> were in when private browsing was enabled and writing changes to  
</I>&gt;<i> disk is re-enabled.
</I>&gt;<i> 5 - Treat LocalStorage as read-only when private browsing is on.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> exists, and all previously stored contents can be retrieved.  Any  
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Option 1 is simple but painful for applications to get such  
</I>&gt;<i> different behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> Option 2 is only a little more complicated, but also seems  
</I>&gt;<i> unsatisfactory.
</I>&gt;<i> Option 3 is simple to implement and option 4 would difficult to  
</I>&gt;<i> implement efficiently.  Both would lead to bizarre behavior where  
</I>&gt;<i> data that the application thought was saved really wasn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For now we're going with option 5.  setItem() during private  
</I>&gt;<i> browsing will fail with the QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR the spec mentions.   
</I>&gt;<i> removeItem() and clear() will silently fail, since the spec assumes  
</I>&gt;<i> they always succeed and doesn't provide a failure mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems the same issues apply to all the storage mechanisms, be it  
</I>&gt;<i> LocalStorage, SessionStorage (with optional session resuming), and  
</I>&gt;<i> Databases.
</I>&gt;<i> I have a few questions I think it would be wise for the spec to  
</I>&gt;<i> address for all of these:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - What *should* the specified behavior be?
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - If read-only ends up being the specified behavior, should we  
</I>&gt;<i> have a mechanism for removeItem() and clear() to demonstrate that  
</I>&gt;<i> they failed?
</I>&gt;<i>
