</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 'timeOffset' instead?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I considered that, but it seems that in the streaming video
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (&quot;DVR-like&quot;) case, in the steady state where the data in the buffer is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; being thrown away at the same rate as the video is being played you'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; end up in a weird position of the currentTime not changing despite the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; video playing, which would likely be even more confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why should the &quot;start time&quot; change in this case? I assume you mean the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server is streaming video and does not support sending any data except
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the data for the current time, and the UA is caching a window of data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then I would expect the element to expose a fixed start time (the time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relative to the start of the resource, at which the UA first opened the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stream). As the stream plays, 'duration' would increase and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'seekable' and 'buffered' TimeRanges would change to reflect the data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the UA has in its buffer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, e.g., a TiVo-like interface, where the input is a TV tuner, or a
</I>&gt;<i> streaming video service that doesn't let you seek but where the UA is
</I>&gt;<i> buffering 15 minutes of content so that the user can seek within that. The
</I>&gt;<i> way this is supported in the spec now, the start time (the &quot;earliest
</I>&gt;<i> possible position&quot;) continually changes, so that the UI doesn't show an
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly long time frame, but instead only shows the last 30 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
To me, &quot;the earliest possible position&quot; seems redundant with the 'seekable'
TimeRanges. I think your use-case can be exposed perfectly adequately with
an indefinite 'duration' and 'seekable' and 'buffered' TimeRanges changing
over time (which will happen in many non-streaming cases too). There is no
need to have 'startTime' changing; that seems an unnecessary complication. I
think that dynamically changing the &quot;time coordinate system&quot; in which
'currentTime' is interpreted is a bad idea.
