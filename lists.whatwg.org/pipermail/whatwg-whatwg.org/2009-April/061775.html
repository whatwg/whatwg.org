Done.

I haven't done this yet but this does seem like the way to go long-term. 
I've added a &quot;v2&quot; note in the spec suggesting this.

Shadows used to be optional, but having optional features is generally not 
desired, and multiple browser vendors have said they're willing to 
implement the feature. This is basically the bar for adding features, so I 
haven't removed the feature from the spec.

I understand that it might be difficult to implement, however, 
haveingmultiple vendors willing to implement something is rare enough that 
we don't tend to ignore those opportunities.
