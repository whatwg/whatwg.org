According to the spec the storage mutex is dropped for blocking operations
like alert() and sync XHR, and as you know, that's effectively what we do.

But the general rule of DOM API design is that operations do not block and
we offer asynchronous APIs instead. alert() and sync XHR are exceptions to
this rule, but they're ugly stepchildren of DOM APIs and we don't want to
treat them as norms.

When deciding how to handle cookies in Chrome, we did not worry about the
&gt;<i> problem being debated here.  Our concerns were allayed by recognizing that
</I>&gt;<i> IE does not try to solve it (and IE6 is multi-process just like Chrome with
</I>&gt;<i> a shared network stack), so clearly web developers must already have to
</I>&gt;<i> cope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You mean IE8.

How would Web developers cope? There's no way to synchronize. I doubt more
than a handful of Web developers even know this problem could exist.

I think it would be best to specify that document.cookie returns a snapshot.
&gt;<i>  I think that is consistent with existing implementations including IE,
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox, and Chrome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not at all. In Firefox, cookies don't change while a script is running, as
long as it doesn't call the handful of blocking DOM APIs (such as alert() or
sync XHR); we satisfy the current spec.

The insidious part is that almost all the time, IE and Chrome will also be
observed to obey the spec; when a quick cookie-read-modify-write script
runs, it is very unlikely cookies will change underneath it. (Is it possible
people don't write such scripts?)

Maybe we need dynamic race detection for Web browsers. After a script reads
document.cookie, stall for a while to give network transactions or scripts
running in other threads a chance to change the cookies so the original
script carries on with wrong data.
