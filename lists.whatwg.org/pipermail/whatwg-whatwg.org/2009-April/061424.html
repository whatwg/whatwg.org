True serializability would imply that the HTTP request read and write are
atomic.  In other words, you'd have to keep a lock for the entirety of each
HTTP request and couldn't do multiple in parallel.  When I said there's no
way to guarantee serializability, I guess I meant to qualify it with &quot;in
practice&quot;.

After thinking about it for a bit, your suggestion of &quot;reading the cookies
to send with an HTTP request is an atomic operation, and writing them as a
result of an HTTP response is an atomic operation&quot; does seems like a pretty
sensible compromise.

The one thing I'd still be concerned about:  localStorage separates storage
space by origins.  In other words, www.google.com cannot access localStorage
values from google.com and visa versa.  Cookies, on the other hand, have a
much more complex scheme of access control.  Coming up with an efficient and
dead-lock-proof locking scheme might take some careful thought.


&gt;<i> The spec is written in such a way that you can't have more that one event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loop per browser window/worker, and everything is essentially tied to this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one event loop.  In other words, each window/worker can't run on more than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one CPU core at a time.  Thus, the only way for a web application to scale
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in todays world is going to be through additional windows and/or workers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depending on exactly what you mean by a &quot;Web application&quot;, that's not
</I>&gt;<i> really true. There are a variety of ways to exploit multicore parallelism
</I>&gt;<i> within a window with the current set of specs, at least in principle.
</I>

What else is there?  (I believe you, I'm just interested in knowing what's
out there.)

Jeremy

P.S. Please don't mistake me for an expert on document.cookie or even
window.localStorage.  I try to fact check myself as I go, but if I say
something that seems stupid, please do let me know.  :-)
