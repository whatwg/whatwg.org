<PRE>OK, here's a more focused question - let's imagine that one is implementing
SharedWorkers in a new browser. One seemingly reasonable way to proceed
would be to have a Worker stay alive as long as there are *any* reachable
entangled ports between any window and that worker. Does this cause some
kind of problem that's addressed by the more complex behavior described in
the spec?
The &quot;any reachable port&quot; implementation seems like it's more along the lines
of what people would expect, and doesn't require a new concept to be tracked
(the port's original creator). I just have the nagging feeling that I'm not
properly translating from &quot;spec language&quot; into actual behavior, and perhaps
the intended behavior is not as complex as the spec implies.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of quick questions about the lifecycle of workers - specifically

</I>&gt;<i> It seems like instead of just using the normal message port reachability
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm (once a worker's message ports are no longer reachable, it is

</I>&gt;<i> original port is still active.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[a worker is permissible if] at some point past or present a MessagePortowned by the worker was entangled with a
</I>&gt;<i> MessagePort *p* whose owner is a Window object whose active document is
</I>&gt;<i> the Document that was that browsing context's active document when *p* was
</I>&gt;<i> created, and that Document is fully active&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am I reading this correctly? It just seems wonky that if I create a shared
</I>&gt;<i> worker from window A, hand the port off to window B, then close window A,
</I>&gt;<i> that worker is now orphaned despite being reachable from window B. But if I
</I>&gt;<i> do the same thing, but before window A closes, window B creates a new port
</I>&gt;<i> and sends it to the worker via the port that window A gave it, the worker
</I>&gt;<i> won't be orphaned when window A closes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the intent here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, one other thing: I was previously under the impression that
</I>&gt;<i> SharedWorkers had a different lifecycle from dedicated Workers -
</I>&gt;<i> SharedWorkers would not exit as long as there were any windows open to that
</I>&gt;<i> domain. In retrospect, I'm pretty sure I just made that up - SharedWorkers
</I>&gt;<i> and dedicated Workers have identical lifecycles, correct?
