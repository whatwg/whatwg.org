Yes, I understand that analogy. But because video can be a very long
resource, media fragment URIs cannot be restriced to client-side
offsetting. Think e.g. about wanting the last 2 minutes out of a 5
hour discussion downloaded to your mobile phone.

The media fragment WG decided that fragment addressing should be done
with &quot;#&quot; and be able to just deliver the actual fragment. (BTW: this
is in contrast to the temporal URIs that were specified for Annodex,
where chopping happened in the UA for &quot;#&quot;  and on the server for &quot;?&quot;).

Cheers,
Silvia.
