<PRE>This is a resend, since my first message, though a reply to Ian,
apparently went into the bit bucket.

I apologize for replying to this thread so late.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type=&quot;pkcs10&quot; attribute in the keygen tag.
</I>
That's an interesting idea.  But PKCS#10 is like a self-signed certificate.
It has a full-blown X.500 Directory Name in it, just like a certificate,
and the KEYGEN tag doesn't provide the input for that.  I guess the browser
could prompt the user, perhaps using a form something like:

<A HREF="http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/main.html">http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/main.html</A>

But heaven help the user to fill that in! :-/

Also like a real certificate, a PKCS#10 certificate request may have
extensions.  This is the way that a cert requester requests that particular
extensions be put into his cert.  Again, the keygen tag has no way of
specifying these.  (But the browser could use a form like:

<A HREF="http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/stnd_ext_form.html">http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/stnd_ext_form.html</A>

There's one other problem with PKCS#10 (and SPKAC too) that I mentioned
before: it only works with public keys that can be used for signing.
If you have an &quot;encryption only&quot; key, you can't request a cert for it
with PKCS#10 because doing so requires generating a signature with it.

To solve these and other problems, an alternative protocol named CRMF
(the &quot;Certificate Request Message Format&quot;) was created.  Mozilla supports
that with the crypto.generateCRMFRequest method.  If we're really going to
standardize something like a keygen tag, we should design it to be able
to do the things that can be done with crypto.generateCRMFRequest, too.
That should not be difficult.  See

<A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/JavaScript_crypto/GenerateCRMFRequest">https://developer.mozilla.org/En/JavaScript_crypto/GenerateCRMFRequest</A>

&gt;<i> I haven't added support for PKCS10 since it doesn't seem to actually add 
</I>&gt;<i> anything to the feature set.
</I>
Well, it potentially allows the user to request specific cert extensions,
but this is generally handled by other means in the form that the user is
filling in.


&gt;&gt;<i>   - An algorithm preference list, specifiying the key algorithms 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferred by the server, in order of preference. In this case a keyword 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> registration process should also be defined. Initial keywords should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cover RSA, DSA and Elliptic Curves. As some methods may require 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters to be transferred to the client the syntax should cover such 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extensions, e.g &quot;alg1;param1=x;param2=y,alg2&quot;, name of parameters should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be selected by the specification for the algorithm, but two parameters 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be defined: Minimum length (e.g. &quot;min-len&quot;) and Maximum Length 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (&quot;max-len&quot;) of the key that can be used to guide the client in what 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keylength it should selects (These should be suggestions, not absolute 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limits, at least for the maximum; the minimum should probably be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered a lower limit)
</I>
Typically, a given CA only certifies certs with a single public key type.
If the user wants to choose a different key type, he probably needs to
choose a different CA (or at least a different CA page).

&gt;<i> I haven't added this, because right now the only browser I could find 
</I>&gt;<i> which supports more than one algorithm is Firefox, and it just has two 
</I>&gt;<i> (RSA and ECs, as far as I could tell).
</I>
And DSA.

&gt;&gt;<i> It is also conceivable that the server should be able to specify which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sites the certificate can be used for. A common usability problem with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client certificates in SSL/TLS is selection of certificate, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particularly when you have many certificates. A list of hostname:port 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pairs would probably be a good way to ease that (the SSL/TLS server can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also specify which CAs it prefers to the certificate was issued by, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nobody is currently using that capability). A list of such sites
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided at generation time might help the user in cases where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SSL/TLS server does not specify preferred CAs.
</I>
Sure, but this doesn't seem relevant to the keygen tag.  It's just more
info that the CA can put into the page that contains the form that contains
the keygen tag.

&gt;&gt;<i> In the future it is also conceivable that such requests is to be made 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for keys stored on smartcards, so a source selector might be an idea, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perhaps also with the capability to specify specific cards.
</I>
Yes, and I think FF UI has that.  It's a feature of the browser's UI, I
think, not of the keygen tag itself.

I apologize for not finishing that sooner. (I had been waiting for a reply
from Ian.)  I have just updated that page with all the presently relevant
details (AFAIK).  I'm thinking about adding some examples of its use to that
page.

&gt;<i> I haven't added ECs to HTML5 since I couldn't find any documentation on it 
</I>&gt;<i> (the above isn't updated yet). Also, I omitted DSA support which is

</I>&gt;<i> nobody actually supports it.
</I>
It's not popular in the commercial world, but I think a certain government
still likes it. :)

&gt;&gt;<i> However, having said that, there are a number of known shortcomings of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the keygen tag, which is why the Netscape and Mozilla browsers also 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support the generateCRMFRequest() method on the crypto object.  [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Among the shortcomings are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) SPKAC is non-standard, but is openly specified and has become a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> de facto standard and is now supported in numerous packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not non-standard any more, I guess!
</I>
Have you really made it a standard?  Or is it now merely some kind of draft?

&gt;&gt;<i> b) The tag has no way to specify whether the key is to be used for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signing-only, or whether it can also be used for data/key encryption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c) The SPKAC format requires that the key be usable for signing, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful for generating encryption-only keys.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> d) The tag has no provision for key escrow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't addressed these; I'm not sure how to for &lt;keygen&gt;. I suppose the 
</I>&gt;<i> methods on the &quot;crypto&quot; object are a better long term solution for this, 
</I>&gt;<i> if there is interest in formally specifying them (e.g. in the W3C Web Apps 
</I>&gt;<i> working group).
</I>
I think that the KEYGEN tag's attributes could be extended to accept all
the arguments that can be passed to crypto.generateCRMFRequest, quite easily.

Which is more likely to be adopted as a cross browser standard?
A new html tag? or a new JavaScript object/method?

If I knew the answer to that question, that would influence my suggestions
for a direction here.
