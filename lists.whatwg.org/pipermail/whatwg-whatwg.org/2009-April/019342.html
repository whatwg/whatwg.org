I don't know how I could be any more clear on this. A new browser  
engine that came out today would have to implement &lt;keygen&gt; to support  
existing Web content. That doesn't mean &lt;keygen&gt; is the world's best  
solution to its problem domain, or that no one will have proprietary  
alternatives. But it does mean that to have a spec you could use to  
build a browser, you have to specify how &lt;keygen&gt; works.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, if the motivation is rather &quot;elevating&quot; Apple's *existing  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation* to full standard, then you are all set :-)
</I>
We don't think &lt;keygen&gt; is awesome. We implemented it as a direct copy  
of what Mozilla had because certificate issuers asked for it. We  
didn't care whether &lt;keygen&gt; was a &quot;full standard&quot; then, and we don't  
really care now, except to the extent that it helps interoperability  
and competitiveness in the browser space to clearly specify it. And we  
think it is a crappy design which leads to ugly code in our engine,  
but regrettably it is needed for compatibility. So I'm really not sure  
what point you are trying to make.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;However, none of this rules out the possibility of putting more  
</I>&gt;<i> advanced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;crypto functionality into browsers, either via HTML or a separate  
</I>&gt;<i> spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy about that :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;So I would recommend that you focus on promoting your preferred
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;solution rather than opposing &lt;keygen&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> I just took my experience in this field and explained why *I* felt  
</I>&gt;<i> that &lt;keygen&gt; needed a successor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If WHATWG took &lt;keygen&gt; to for example IETF-PKIX, a *real'  
</I>&gt;<i> standardization effort on this minor feature could easily take 2-3  
</I>&gt;<i> years to complete!
</I>
Based on this it sounds to me like it would be worthwhile to start a  
separate standardization effort for a newer, better way to handle key  
generation and cert requests. We don't want to hold HTML5 2-3 years  
for a new feature. But nothing prevents working on it in parallel.

Maciej
