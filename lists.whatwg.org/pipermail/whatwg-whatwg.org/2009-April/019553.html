</I>&gt;<i> arcTo(100,0,  0,0, 10);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This should add a new, from p1 infinite far away, point to the subpath

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two questions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) If I add lineTo(50, 50); after arcTo(..). Wouldn't it draw a &quot;quasi 
</I>&gt;<i> parallel&quot; line to the line of arcTo? Because (Xx, Yx) (mentioned in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec) is infinite far away. That means, we will never reach this point 
</I>&gt;<i> in reality.

</I>&gt;<i> example above. Just make strokeStyle transparent, use arcTo from above 
</I>&gt;<i> and you're done. And moveTo(infinite, infinite); would be possible too.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe adding an infinite far away point is wrong and insteaed 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing should be drawn at all and I would like to explain my reason:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine 2 vectors. One from (x1, y1) to (x0, y0) and one from (x1, y1) 
</I>&gt;<i> to (x2, y2). For
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> moveTo(100, 0);
</I>&gt;<i> arcTo(150,0, 50, 0, 10);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the angle between the two vectors is 0. Now we want to calculate the two 
</I>&gt;<i> points on the tangents of the circle with the radius r. r is not null 
</I>&gt;<i> (first point of the specification for arcTo). Now put it to a system of 
</I>&gt;<i> equations and you won't get a solution. It's unresolveable. Why is 
</I>&gt;<i> something allowed, that is not calculateable?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The next reason is, that infinite or NaN values are not alowed for 
</I>&gt;<i> lineTo and moveTo , ... . But it's possible to get support for infinte 
</I>&gt;<i> indirectly with arcTo (see comment above). And how to deal with a 
</I>&gt;<i> infinite far away point? A lineTo would never reach this point, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> infinite far away. Instead we have to draw a line parallel to the 
</I>&gt;<i> infinite long line, created by arcTo (and it's infinite long too).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can moveTo(-1e+300, 0) and moveTo(1e+300, 2e+300), which are much
</I>&gt;<i> more similar to what arcTo is meant to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Considering the general case where the arcTo's points are not
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly horizontal, the idea is that the point is not simply a point
</I>&gt;<i> with coordinates (+/-Infinity, +/-Infinity) - it's really the
</I>&gt;<i> (theoretical) limit of a point with coordinates (x+dx*t, y+dy*t) as t
</I>&gt;<i> approaches infinity, where x,y,dx,dy represent the position/direction
</I>&gt;<i> of the (x1,y1)--(x2,y2) line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where the spec says &quot;(x&#8734;, y&#8734;) is the point that is infinitely far away
</I>&gt;<i> from (x1, y1), that lies on the same line as (x0, y0), (x1, y1), and
</I>&gt;<i> (x2, y2)&quot;, you could read it as &quot;...the point that is very very far
</I>&gt;<i> away from ...&quot;, e.g. take the (x1,y1)--(x2,y2) line and then move
</I>&gt;<i> 1e+100 units in that direction, and it would be good enough that
</I>&gt;<i> nobody would notice the tiny error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You already have to handle something very similar to this case, because 
</I>&gt;<i> (x2,y2) might be very very close to the line (x0,y0)--(x1,y1), which 
</I>&gt;<i> means the start/end tangent points will be very very far away in the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate direction. The special case where (x2,y2) is precisely on 
</I>&gt;<i> the line is not really special - the points are just even further 
</I>&gt;<i> (infinitely far) away in that direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a concrete example: see 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/arcto-inf.html">http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/arcto-inf.html</A>&gt;, which I believe 
</I>&gt;<i> should have output like 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/arcto-inf.png">http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/arcto-inf.png</A>&gt; (from Safari 3.0.4 
</I>&gt;<i> for Windows). As (x2,y2) gets closer to the line of the first two 
</I>&gt;<i> points, the start/end tangent points are pushed further over to the 
</I>&gt;<i> left. When y2=0.1 they're far enough away that the two straight lines 
</I>&gt;<i> are nearly horizontal; when y2=0 it's basically the same, except now 
</I>&gt;<i> they're precisely horizontal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the spec's behaviour makes sense from a theoretical 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, because it avoids any discontinuities in the output when 
</I>&gt;<i> the input variables are changed a tiny bit. And it made sense from a 
</I>&gt;<i> practical perspective, because it matched the behaviour of Safari 3.0 
</I>&gt;<i> (though apparently things have changed in 3.1).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't know if it makes sense from the perspective of someone who's 
</I>&gt;<i> got to write an independent implementation of it. Does the above 
</I>&gt;<i> explanation make more sense than the text in the spec? and if so, does 
</I>&gt;<i> it seem implementable? If so, it seems best to keep the spec's behaviour 
</I>&gt;<i> and try to clarify the spec's text. But this doesn't seem like an 
</I>&gt;<i> important case where users will be unhappy if e.g. the arcTo call draws 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing when all the points are on the same line, so if it's still a 
</I>&gt;<i> pain to implement the spec's behaviour then I would be happy with 
</I>&gt;<i> changing what the spec requires.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't checked this part of the spec insofar; looking at the image 
</I>&gt;<i> you posted it seems the 3 points are used as control points in a 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat algorithm to draw curve lines; personally, thinking to an API 
</I>&gt;<i> function to draw arcs, I prefer to have the specified points as being 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the arc itself (e.g., the two external ones are the extremes of 
</I>&gt;<i> a convex elliptical arc). Anyway, certainly what you say makes sense for 
</I>&gt;<i> an arc degenering to a line (that is, if all points lay on the same 
</I>&gt;<i> line). Assuming the angular coefficient and the start point of the line 
</I>&gt;<i> are known, it is easy to find the intersection between it and a clip 
</I>&gt;<i> region (through the mean-point algorithm) -- it should be the same with 
</I>&gt;<i> a (x2, y2) point very close with the (x0, y0)--(x1, y1) segment, that is 
</I>&gt;<i> if under a certain threshold one can't drow an arc and instead the 
</I>&gt;<i> result must be approximated to a half-infinite line (I think all an 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation needs is to remember an infinite line has been drawn and 
</I>&gt;<i> the last point in the subpath is infinitely far, so it can draw a 
</I>&gt;<i> parallel line when .lineTo() is invocked).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After some discussion on IRC, it seems this part of the spec is not a 
</I>&gt;<i> great idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, the low-level graphics APIs have limited coordinate 
</I>&gt;<i> range and rely on the &quot;User agents may impose implementation-specific 
</I>&gt;<i> limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of 
</I>&gt;<i> service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work 
</I>&gt;<i> around platform-specific limitations.&quot; clause (and common sense) to let 
</I>&gt;<i> them have undefined behaviour when people use really large coordinate 
</I>&gt;<i> values. The infinitely-distant point required by arcTo is a really large 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate value, but we don't want this case to be undefined behaviour 
</I>&gt;<i> (because it can occur with nice small integer input values and people 
</I>&gt;<i> might accidentally use it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing the behaviour currently in the spec (with the 
</I>&gt;<i> infinitely-distant point) is not trivial, because it requires code 
</I>&gt;<i> unique to that special case (rather than falling naturally out of an 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of the rest of arcTo's behaviour) and has to be careful 
</I>&gt;<i> to act enough like an infinitely-distance point while remaining within 
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation limits.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And it seems like a rare edge case where people disagree on whether the 
</I>&gt;<i> output is sensible, and nobody is really going to care what the output 
</I>&gt;<i> is (as long as it's well defined); so it doesn't seem worthwhile having 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone understand and implement the non-trivial behaviour that's in 
</I>&gt;<i> the spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, in the interest of having something that implementors are more 
</I>&gt;<i> likely to converge on, I'd suggest replacing the behaviour in that case 
</I>&gt;<i> (the &quot;the direction from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1) is the opposite of the 
</I>&gt;<i> direction from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)&quot; case) with simply drawing a 
</I>&gt;<i> straight line from (x0, y0) to (y1, y1), which is easy and apparently is 
</I>&gt;<i> what Safari on OS X already does. It's also the same as the other case 
</I>&gt;<i> in that paragraph, so the whole paragraph can be collapsed to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Otherwise, if the points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), and (x2, y2) all lie on 
</I>&gt;<i> a single straight line, then the method must add the point (x1, y1) to 
</I>&gt;<i> the subpath, and connect that point to the previous point (x0, y0) by a 
</I>&gt;<i> straight line.&quot;
</I>
So changed.
