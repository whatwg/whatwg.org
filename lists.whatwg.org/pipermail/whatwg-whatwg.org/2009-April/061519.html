<PRE>Yes. An incognito session starts with a blank profile, so no cookies, no
cache, ...

</I>&gt;<i> In Chrome/Chromium, &quot;incognito&quot; mode is basically a new profile that is in
</I>&gt;<i> memory (plus or minus... the cache will never get written out to disk,
</I>&gt;<i> although of course the memory pages could get swapped out and hit the disk
</I>&gt;<i> that way...). The implication is that, for many of these features, things
</I>&gt;<i> could just naturally get handled. That is, whilst the session is active,
</I>&gt;<i> pages can still use a database / local storage / ... / and at the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> session, when that profile is deleted, things will go away. I personally
</I>&gt;<i> like that approach, as there may be legitimate reasons to want to use a
</I>&gt;<i> database even for just a single session. (Perhaps someone wants to edit a
</I>&gt;<i> spreadsheet and the spreadsheet app wants to use a database on the client as
</I>&gt;<i> a backing store for fast edits, I don't know...). I just don't like the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of saying &quot;Sorry, incognito/private/... means a class of pages won't work&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> if there's no reason it has to be that way.
</I>&gt;<i> In short, I would prefer something closest to Option 3. It lets pages just
</I>&gt;<i> work, but respects the privacy wishes of the user. (AppCache / persistent
</I>&gt;<i> workers are the one exception where I think Option3 doesn't apply and we
</I>&gt;<i> need to figure something out.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A commonly added feature in browsers these days is &quot;private browsing mode&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where the intention is that the user's browsing session leaves no footprint
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on their machine.  Cookies, cache files, history, and other data that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser would normally store to disk are not updated during these private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsing sessions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This concept is at odds with allowing pages to store data on the user's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine as allowed by LocalStorage and Databases.  Surly persistent changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during a private browsing session shouldn't be written to the user's disk as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would violate the intention of a private browsing session.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's take the specific case of LocalStorage, which is what I am currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working on with WebKit.  In attempting to fix this bug I came up with a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible solutions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1 - Disable LocalStorage completely when private browsing is on.  Remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it from the DOM completely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 - Disable LocalStorage mostly when private browsing is on.  It exists at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window.localStorage, but is empty and has a 0-quota.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3 - Slide a &quot;fake&quot; LocalStorage object in when private browsing is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enabled.  It starts empty, changes to it are successful, but it is never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> written to disk.  When private browsing is disabled, all changes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> private browsing proxy are thrown out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 - Cover the real LocalStorage object with a private browsing layer.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> starts with all previously stored contents.  Any changes to it are pretended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to occur, but are never written to disk.  When private browsing is disabled,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all items revert to the state they were in when private browsing was enabled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and writing changes to disk is re-enabled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5 - Treat LocalStorage as read-only when private browsing is on.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exists, and all previously stored contents can be retrieved.  Any attempt to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() fail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Option 1 is simple but painful for applications to get such different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Option 2 is only a little more complicated, but also seems unsatisfactory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Option 3 is simple to implement and option 4 would difficult to implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efficiently.  Both would lead to bizarre behavior where data that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application thought was saved really wasn't.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For now we're going with option 5.  setItem() during private browsing will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail with the QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR the spec mentions.  removeItem() and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clear() will silently fail, since the spec assumes they always succeed and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't provide a failure mechanism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems the same issues apply to all the storage mechanisms, be it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LocalStorage, SessionStorage (with optional session resuming), and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Databases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a few questions I think it would be wise for the spec to address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for all of these:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1 - What *should* the specified behavior be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 - If read-only ends up being the specified behavior, should we have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism for removeItem() and clear() to demonstrate that they failed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ~Brady
