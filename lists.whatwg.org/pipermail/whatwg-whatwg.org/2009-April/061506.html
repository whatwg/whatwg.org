Ah, OK.  I agree that telling UAs what they should do, ought to be 
for the most part, out of scope.  But if there is material that the 
page author does NOT want to have shown, they probably need to know 
whether the # syntax will assure them that the user is restricted. 
(Always understanding that if they copy-paste the URL, neitehr # nor 
? syntax stops them from changing the selection range).  Think of 
presenting a K-12 class with a clip from a movie...

My mental analogy was HTML, where an acnhor takes you to that part of 
the page as a convenience, but nothing stops you from navigating 
away.  And in the case where the UA optimizes for showing that 
section (by suitable handshakes/translations with the server), again, 
it could present a UI which offers other times -- at the expense of 
more handshakes.
