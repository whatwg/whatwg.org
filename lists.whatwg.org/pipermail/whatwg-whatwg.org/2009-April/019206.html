<PRE>
I have now specified the &lt;keygen&gt; element in HTML5.

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-keygen-element">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-keygen-element</A>

I would appreciate review by people who know what this stuff means, as 
I'll be the first to admit not having any idea what I'm doing here.

I haven't added any new features to &lt;keygen&gt; at this time. I want to start 
by making sure the spec as written matches reality.

&quot;Very clear&quot; is not the terminology I would use. Hopefully the text of the 
HTML5 spec now shows the level of detail I was looking for. (Hopefully it 
is correct, too.)

</I>&gt;<i> installation dialog. It is also possible to import such certificate 
</I>&gt;<i> manually. The certificate is installed together with the previously 
</I>&gt;<i> stored private key.
</I>
I haven't specified this bit, since it seems out of scope for HTML5.


&gt;<i> Submission formats:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The default format, introduced by Netscape, is the SPKAC format, see the 
</I>&gt;<i> above link, and includes the public key and the Keygen challenge 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, and is signed by the private key.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The actual standardized format is PKCS #10, in form a more advanced and 
</I>&gt;<i> flexible version of SPKAC (it is the format used to request certificates 
</I>&gt;<i> for webservers), and I am not sure if this is now used by default in 
</I>&gt;<i> some clients. In Opera this format can be selected by using a 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;pkcs10&quot; attribute in the keygen tag.
</I>
I haven't added support for PKCS10 since it doesn't seem to actually add 
anything to the feature set.


&gt;<i> My suggestion for the keygen tag is to add some functionality, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> the format selector:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - A type attribute, or a better way to select the format. I think the 
</I>&gt;<i> specification should encourage PKCS10 as the default, but specifically 
</I>&gt;<i> require servers to accept SPKAC. Adding a format selector allows future 
</I>&gt;<i> enhancements with new formats in a backwards compatible fashion. I 
</I>&gt;<i> should think that a registration method should be defined for such 
</I>&gt;<i> formats (similar to IANA)
</I>
I think we should wait until we have some future enhancements before 
adding new formats here.


&gt;<i>   - An algorithm preference list, specifiying the key algorithms 
</I>&gt;<i> preferred by the server, in order of preference. In this case a keyword 
</I>&gt;<i> registration process should also be defined. Initial keywords should 
</I>&gt;<i> cover RSA, DSA and Elliptic Curves. As some methods may require 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters to be transferred to the client the syntax should cover such 
</I>&gt;<i> extensions, e.g &quot;alg1;param1=x;param2=y,alg2&quot;, name of parameters should 
</I>&gt;<i> be selected by the specification for the algorithm, but two parameters 
</I>&gt;<i> should be defined: Minimum length (e.g. &quot;min-len&quot;) and Maximum Length 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;max-len&quot;) of the key that can be used to guide the client in what 
</I>&gt;<i> keylength it should selects (These should be suggestions, not absolute 
</I>&gt;<i> limits, at least for the maximum; the minimum should probably be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered a lower limit)
</I>
I haven't added this, because right now the only browser I could find 
which supports more than one algorithm is Firefox, and it just has two 
(RSA and ECs, as far as I could tell).

Going forward maybe we should add this to the keytype=&quot;&quot; attribute, 
though, making it a space separated list instead of an enumerated 
attribute. For the parameters, maybe we can use different attributes for 
the different types? e.g. dsaparams=&quot;&quot; ecparams=&quot;&quot; etc? Netscape 4 used to 
have pqg=&quot;&quot; for DSA (PQG is what DSA's parameters are called) so there is 
some precedent there.


&gt;<i> It is also conceivable that the server should be able to specify which sites
</I>&gt;<i> the certificate can be used for. A common usability problem with client
</I>&gt;<i> certificates in SSL/TLS is selection of certificate, particularly when you
</I>&gt;<i> have many certificates. A list of hostname:port pairs would probably be a good
</I>&gt;<i> way to ease that (the SSL/TLS server can also specify which CAs it prefers to
</I>&gt;<i> the certificate was issued by, but nobody is currently using that capability).
</I>&gt;<i> A list of such sites provided at generation time might help the user in cases
</I>&gt;<i> where the SSL/TLS server does not specify preferred CAs.
</I>
It seems like we should encourage people to use the existing feature you 
mention rather than adding more features to do effectively the same thing.


&gt;<i> In the future it is also conceivable that such requests is to be made 
</I>&gt;<i> for keys stored on smartcards, so a source selector might be an idea, 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps also with the capability to specify specific cards.
</I>
I'd rather we didn't specify this before it was ready to be a reality.

That's possible, but I'm not sure what to do about it.

</I>
I haven't added ECs to HTML5 since I couldn't find any documentation on it 
(the above isn't updated yet). Also, I omitted DSA support which is 
claimed to be supported on the above page, because as far as I can tell 
nobody actually supports it.


&gt;<i> However, having said that, there are a number of known shortcomings of 
</I>&gt;<i> the keygen tag, which is why the Netscape and Mozilla browsers also 
</I>&gt;<i> support the generateCRMFRequest() method on the crypto object.  See 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/JavaScript_crypto/GenerateCRMFRequest">https://developer.mozilla.org/En/JavaScript_crypto/GenerateCRMFRequest</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> for documentation on that method.
</I>
I haven't specified this method. I would recommend specifying the entire 
&quot;crypto&quot; object in a separate working group, since it is orthogonal to the 
rest of HTML (unlike &lt;keygen&gt;, which fits into the parser and form 
submission and so on).


&gt;<i> Among the shortcomings are:
</I>&gt;<i> a) SPKAC is non-standard, but is openly specified and has become a
</I>&gt;<i> de facto standard and is now supported in numerous packages.
</I>
It's not non-standard any more, I guess!


&gt;<i> b) The tag has no way to specify whether the key is to be used for
</I>&gt;<i> signing-only, or whether it can also be used for data/key encryption.
</I>&gt;<i> c) The SPKAC format requires that the key be usable for signing, not
</I>&gt;<i> useful for generating encryption-only keys.
</I>&gt;<i> d) The tag has no provision for key escrow.
</I>
I haven't addressed these; I'm not sure how to for &lt;keygen&gt;. I suppose the 
methods on the &quot;crypto&quot; object are a better long term solution for this, 
if there is interest in formally specifying them (e.g. in the W3C Web Apps 
working group).
