Why should the &quot;start time&quot; change in this case? I assume you mean the
server is streaming video and does not support sending any data except the
data for the current time, and the UA is caching a window of data. Then I
would expect the element to expose a fixed start time (the time, relative to
the start of the resource, at which the UA first opened the stream). As the
stream plays, 'duration' would increase and the 'seekable' and 'buffered'
TimeRanges would change to reflect the data the UA has in its buffer.
