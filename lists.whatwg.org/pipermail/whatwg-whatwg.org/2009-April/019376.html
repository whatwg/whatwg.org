It's not really intended to be an introduction, so much as a complete list 
of use cases that people want the spec to cover.


&gt;<i> Ian, would it help if I continue to elaborate on the RDFa use cases on 
</I>&gt;<i> the RDFa wiki? Or perhaps, I could merge these use cases into the RDFa 
</I>&gt;<i> wiki and elaborate on the WHATWG micro-data use cases first? I'd like to 
</I>&gt;<i> focus my effort on something that will benefit /both/ WHATWG and the 
</I>&gt;<i> RDFa community. Thoughts?
</I>
&gt;<i>From the point of view of the HTML5 effort, what is needed is use cases, 
</I>scenarios, and requirements, that don't in any way imply a particular 
solution, as in the list I posted, so that solutions can be evaluated.

The rdfa.info wiki page was invaluable in the creation of the list I 
posted this morning -- I used that, as well as blog comments and about 
15,000 lines' worth of e-mails, in the creation of the list. I tried to 
make sure every use case mentioned was covered, so if anyone posted a use 
case to this mailing list, to the wiki, or to blogs on the subject in the 
past few months, that is not listed in that e-mail, I apologise -- please 
let me know so that I can add them. (It may be that I didn't understand 
the use case -- there's a couple I don't get, noted with &quot;(why?)&quot; in the 
e-mail sent this morning.)

The more concrete the use cases the better. Users do concrete things.
