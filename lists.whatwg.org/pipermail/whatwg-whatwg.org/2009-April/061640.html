</I>&gt;<i> A commonly added feature in browsers these days is &quot;private browsing

</I>&gt;<i> footprint on their machine.
</I>
Different &quot;private browsing modes&quot; have different philosophies and 
purposes, but yes, this feature does exist in different variations in 
different browsers.


&gt;<i> Cookies, cache files, history, and other data that the browser would 
</I>&gt;<i> normally store to disk are not updated during these private browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> sessions.
</I>
That is one implementation strategy, indeed.


&gt;<i> This concept is at odds with allowing pages to store data on the user's 
</I>&gt;<i> machine as allowed by LocalStorage and Databases.  Surly persistent 
</I>&gt;<i> changes during a private browsing session shouldn't be written to the 
</I>&gt;<i> user's disk as that would violate the intention of a private browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> session.
</I>
I think we can all agree that nothing should be written to disk, yes.


&gt;<i> Let's take the specific case of LocalStorage, which is what I am 
</I>&gt;<i> currently working on with WebKit.  In attempting to fix this bug I came 
</I>&gt;<i> up with a few possible solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - Disable LocalStorage completely when private browsing is on.  Remove it
</I>&gt;<i> from the DOM completely.
</I>
Not implementing a feature is an option, though it would cause sites that 
use that feature to not work.


&gt;<i> 2 - Disable LocalStorage mostly when private browsing is on.  It exists 
</I>&gt;<i> at window.localStorage, but is empty and has a 0-quota.
</I>
This doesn't seem to offer any advantages over the previous option, though 
it is more likely to run into trouble (e.g. sites that detect its support 
will assume it is functional instead of falling back on another feature).


&gt;<i> 3 - Slide a &quot;fake&quot; LocalStorage object in when private browsing is 
</I>&gt;<i> enabled. It starts empty, changes to it are successful, but it is never 
</I>&gt;<i> written to disk.  When private browsing is disabled, all changes to the 
</I>&gt;<i> private browsing proxy are thrown out.
</I>
That seems like a reasonable strategy; it would be equivalent to the 
browser being two user agents, one for the private mode and one for the 
regular mode.


&gt;<i> 4 - Cover the real LocalStorage object with a private browsing layer.  
</I>&gt;<i> It starts with all previously stored contents.  Any changes to it are 
</I>&gt;<i> pretended to occur, but are never written to disk.  When private 
</I>&gt;<i> browsing is disabled, all items revert to the state they were in when 
</I>&gt;<i> private browsing was enabled and writing changes to disk is re-enabled.
</I>
That is again a reasonable implementation strategy, similar to the 
previous one.


&gt;<i> 5 - Treat LocalStorage as read-only when private browsing is on.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> exists, and all previously stored contents can be retrieved.  Any 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() fail.
</I>
This would be equivalent to the user agent having hardware limitations 
preventing it from complying with the specification, as with an out-of- 
memory condition or some such. User agents are explicitly allowed to make 
arbitrary implementation choices for such cases.

Note though that this allows the sites to detect with some reliability 
when they are being visited in &quot;private&quot; mode. This can be a problem.


&gt;<i> For now we're going with option 5.  setItem() during private browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> will fail with the QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR the spec mentions.  removeItem() 
</I>&gt;<i> and clear() will silently fail, since the spec assumes they always 
</I>&gt;<i> succeed and doesn't provide a failure mechanism.
</I>
If the private browsing mode is documented as being intended to act in a 
manner that does not comply with the specification, that seems fine 
(though it leaks to the site the information that the user is using 
private browsing mode, which could be a problem). It is the equivalent of 
&quot;Small Screen Rendering&quot; mode in browsers like Opera, where the CSS 
specifications are intentionally not implemented correctly in order to 
achieve particular results the author didn't intend.


&gt;<i> 1 - What *should* the specified behavior be?
</I>
Since the answer depends on the philosophy of the browser feature, which 
can vary from implementation to implementation, there is no single answer 
to this. I don't think this is something that can or should be described 
in a formal user-agent-independent specification.


&gt;<i> 2 - If read-only ends up being the specified behavior, should we have a 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for removeItem() and clear() to demonstrate that they failed?
</I>
They can always fail with a user-agent-specific exception, as with &quot;out 
of memory&quot; conditions.

</I>
This is a reasonable implementation strategy, equivalent, as you describe, 
to the browser pretending to be two different user agents, and the 
configuration or user data for one of these user agents being deleted 
before the user can use it again.

</I>
This is no different to the normal case, where the hard disk might fail 
unexpectedly, or the user might wipe his profile, or uninstall the 
browser, or switch to another browser, or another computer. It's just that 
we know ahead of time (and theoretically, the user knows ahead of time) 
that the data will be lost. This could be addressed by some UI informing 
the user that the data is not permanently stored, e.g. an infobar when a 
change is detected that says:

   This site has attempted to store data locally. Because you are in 
   Private Browsing Mode, this data will be lost when you close this 
   window. (( More information ))

There could even be some interface to force the information to be stored, 
though care would have to be taken to implement this in a way that doesn't 
clobber information set in the regular-mode browsing contexts.

I think in practice they're more like files, where arbitrarily misplacing 
them is common.

Not currently.


&gt;<i> Because if we had an API which would let the browser tell an app &quot;my 
</I>&gt;<i> user has decided to reduce your available space to &lt;x&gt;&quot; and the user 
</I>&gt;<i> picks 0, then the app can choose to flush all of its pending data.
</I>
Since this might happen even when the Web page in question isn't open, or 
when the user is visiting one app (e.g. Mail) when that domain stores data 
for multiple other apps (e.g. Calendar and Contacts), I don't really see 
how we can do this.

I think this would also lead to sites depending on this, which they can't, 
for numerous reasons already listed (e.g. the user just moving to another 
computer without doing anything about his browser's local data).

I disagree that lying to the app is the same as lying to the user. Is 
blocking third-party cookies &quot;lying to the user&quot;?


&gt;<i> Imagine a scenario where a user has no network connection and

</I>
That would seem like a UI bug. Surely there should be no doubt in the 
user's mind as to which mode he is using.

Exposing this to plugins makes sense; I recommend raising this with the 
plugin-futures group working on the NPAPI.

From the specification's perspective, yes. Assuming you're implementing 
&quot;private browsing mode&quot; as a &quot;pretend to be on a readonly filesystem&quot; 
mode, then you've just enabled a mode in which the browser pretends to 
have a hardware limitation preventing it from writing to disk.
