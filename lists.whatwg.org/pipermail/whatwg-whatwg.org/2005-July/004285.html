   I don't. It's almost entirely useless, and no one really uses it anyways.

&gt;<i> Most common link types
</I>&gt;<i> out there are used with 'rel', but some 'rev' values can also be
</I>&gt;<i> useful. Here are some use cases:
</I>&gt;<i>    - rev=&quot;footnote&quot; for a link back from the footnote or endnote to
</I>&gt;<i>      the source anchor in the main text
</I>&gt;<i>    - rev=&quot;help&quot; for a link to the part of the site that the help
</I>&gt;<i>      text is about
</I>
   This is largely useless, as you are unlikely to start at a
help/footnote document and go to the document for which the help
document was written. The most common situation is that you clicked the
help/footnote like from the parent document, and therefore the
relationship is already established from the parent document.

&gt;<i>    - rev=&quot;author&quot; on a personal site or resume for links to documents
</I>&gt;<i>      s/he has written
</I>
   Here, you're using |rev| to replace missing metadata in the target
document. What happens when &lt;meta name=&quot;Author&quot;&gt; is defined in the
target documents? Does |rev| override? What would a UA do with the
information anyway? If there's a link, wouldn't there be text stating
that the creator of the personal site created the document the link is to?

&gt;<i> See also <A HREF="http://www.eastgate.com/HypertextNow/archives/Trigg.html">http://www.eastgate.com/HypertextNow/archives/Trigg.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> for a direction link types could go in which 'rev' would be useful.
</I>
   Well, I scanned over it, and I noticed one good point. People often
don't bother putting in relationship types for links. Therefore, |rev|
could establish what the relationship is when you reach the target
document. The problem is that the argument is mostly self-defeating. If
people fail to use |rel|, how is a reverse version of that same
attribute going to be used with any frequency.

   At least with |rel|, you could harvest hyperlinks and put them into a
link toolbar. With |rev|, you're describing the relationship type of the
current document. Therefore, I really don't see what user agents are
supposed to do with |rev| and how they can create a useful interface
that can exploit this attribute.

&gt;<i> Many of the link types suggested there would be easier to use with
</I>&gt;<i> rev for the reverse link than with a separate keyword that means
</I>&gt;<i> the inverse relationship.
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i>    rev=&quot;refutation&quot; to link to the article one is refuting
</I>
Counterexample:
|<i> &lt;meta name=&quot;refuting&quot; content=&quot;
</I>|<i>  Intelligent Design;
</I>|<i>  <A HREF="http://hemadeyou.org">http://hemadeyou.org</A>
</I>|<i> &quot;&gt;
</I>
   True, from a pure language standpoint, |rev| is more convenient.
However, if the author makes the hyperlink text &quot;Click here!&quot;, and the
link is broken, what does the user agent have left to work with? The
same kind of abuse is not likely to happen with &lt;meta&gt;.
