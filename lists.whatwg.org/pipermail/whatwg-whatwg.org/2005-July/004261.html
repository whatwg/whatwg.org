</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It's been said that no one will use these except people who write about 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this kind of thing on their weblogs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that people who write weblogs are an important part of our target 
</I>&gt;<i> market, by the way. A minority in the real world but still an important 
</I>&gt;<i> one, because they are often at the cutting edge. If bloggers use a 
</I>&gt;<i> technology a lot, then it is quite likely that it will cause others to use 
</I>&gt;<i> it as well. (RSS is an example of this.)
</I>
(Minor point here: they'll pick up a new technology, but they'll still 
be lazy in using it)

&gt;&gt;<i>I think this is for a very important reason: people are lazy, and they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>don't want to do any more than they have to to get the job done. In the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>case of a paragraph with a list inside of it, *the semantics are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>imparted by the natural language of the document*. If I write &quot;...an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>egg, flour, and butter...&quot;, I don't need to write &lt;ul&gt;, because it's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>already a list. And since I don't need to, I won't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely. I totally agree. The main use case is for marking up cases 
</I>&gt;<i> where one would have written:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;Bla bla bla:&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;li&gt;Bla,&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;li&gt;Bla, and&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;li&gt;Bla&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;...bla bla bla.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a structure I use a lot in e-mails, for instance. In this case, it 
</I>&gt;<i> is clear that the sentence spans more than one &lt;p&gt;, but the sentence is 
</I>&gt;<i> still just one semantic paragraph. Hence the list is in the paragraph, and 
</I>&gt;<i> thus the &lt;ul&gt; should be too.
</I>
Then what I said later applies: &lt;p&gt; isn't for marking up paragraphs. The 
natural language tells the reader that it's a paragraph, so the markup 
doesn't need to. The markup is for separating one block of text from the 
next.

&gt;&gt;<i>As much as we tell people that &quot;&lt;p&gt; doesn't mean 'line break', it means 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>'paragraph'!&quot;, that's not true. &lt;p&gt; doesn't mean &quot;paragraph&quot;, it means 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;a standalone block of text&quot;. This is true everywhere on the internet: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the w3c specs, the current work of the whatwg specs, my webpages, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I'm sure the webpages of everyone else here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current work of the WHATWG specs says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    A paragraph is typically a block of text with one or more sentences 
</I>&gt;<i>    that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can also be used 
</I>&gt;<i>    for more general thematic grouping. For instance, an address is also a 
</I>&gt;<i>    paragraph, as is a part of a form, a byline, or a stanza in a poem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...which seems clear enough to me. Incidentally, this is an example of one 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph, starting at &quot;The current work&quot; and ending at &quot;in the middle&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> including the blockquote in the middle.
</I>
Without the content model change, that quote is good[1]. If the content 
model is changed, though, it would seem to give &lt;p&gt; two meanings: a 
standalone piece of text, and a grammatical paragraph. Only the first is 
what it should be; the latter is unnecessary.


&gt;&gt;<i>P.S.: Sorry for being 3 months late to the discussion. I'm 600 mails 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>behind now, trying to catch up. Also sorry if this thread has come up 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>elsewhere, I didn't see it in the subjects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't worry. I will be returning to many of these topics once the WA1 spec 
</I>&gt;<i> is in more solid shape. At the moment I am attempting to flesh out first 
</I>&gt;<i> drafts for all the new features, so that I can get implementation feedback 
</I>&gt;<i> on those bits. As was requested by members of the list, I will only be 
</I>&gt;<i> returning to the more semantic sides of the discussion after the newer 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;applicationy&quot; bits are written.
</I>
That's fine, take as long as you need (I certainly did). :-)


[1] I would prefer:

A paragraph is typically a block of text with one or more sentences, as 
in grammar, but can also be any other self-contained block of text, such 
as a sentence fragment, byline, or address.

...or something else including the lines &quot;self-contained block of text&quot; 
or an equivelant.
