</I>&gt;<i> and given the all-clear.
</I>
   Of course he gave it the all clear. He's the one who wrote the
disputed portion of the spec in the first place.

&gt;<i> CSS3 UI is pretty clear about the fact that pretty much all elements match 
</I>&gt;<i> either :read-only or :read-write, for example is a document is loaded in 
</I>&gt;<i> an editor (say, Amaya), all elements become :read-write.
</I>
   And if it's changed later, say in a CSS3-UI Revision 1, you'll have
to change the language in WF2 to follow suit, because WF2 deliberately
reiterates parts of the current CSS3-UI.

&gt;&gt;<i>Second, why would I need :read-only on things like &lt;label&gt;, &lt;option&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and &lt;optgroup&gt;? Outside an HTML editor, how would I even edit something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>like that?!?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The HTML editor is a major use case, as is contentEditable.
</I>
   No, the latter has a use case, one that I have suggested an
alternative to (:editable). No one has properly explained why the former
is a use case, because you'd potentially want consistent styling with
regard to editor-specific presentation.

&gt;&gt;<i>I don't think WF2 should contain ANYTHING that is specifically in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>violation of the original XForms definition of :read-only and 
</I>&gt;&gt;:<i>read-write.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> XForms is irrelevant here. Its section is non-normative, and its working 
</I>&gt;<i> group has no authority over CSS (at best it can do what we're doing, 
</I>&gt;<i> namely, defining how CSS3 UI maps to XForms).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS3 UI is what matters, not XForms. (I'm a member of the CSS working 
</I>&gt;<i> group and we worked closely with the XForms working group as far as CSS3 
</I>&gt;<i> UI goes, for what it's worth.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What's the use case for editor-specific presentation (especially when 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there's no such media as &quot;editor&quot;, so far as I know)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> N|vu, e.g. (Why would it be a media? The media is &quot;screen&quot;, typically.)
</I>
   Some kind of pseudo-class would probably be better, since the editor
could potentially be using media. That doesn't explain why :read-only
and :read-write should be used for editor-specific presentation.

&gt;&gt;<i>My concern is that CSS3-UI has expanded the definitions of :read-only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and :read-write to the point where they serve no useful purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend sending your comments to www-style. As far as WHATWG goes, we 
</I>&gt;<i> have to take CSS3 UI as gospel and work from there.
</I>
   Even so, you could simply refer generally to CSS specifications
without restating their content. By restating content, you make the spec
potentially incompatible with future revisions of the CSS3-UI spec.

&gt;&gt;<i>Actually, they're mutually exclusive in markup. When are you ever going 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to have &lt;input readonly disabled&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the control which would otherwise be readonly is irrelevant. It could 
</I>&gt;<i> be readonly because it's being used much like an &lt;output&gt; field (but one 
</I>&gt;<i> that will submit). It would be disabled when its value is not relevant, 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. because that part of the form is not being used.
</I>
   In a script-free scenario, you might as well be using &lt;span&gt;. In a
scenario with script, when would you disable the &lt;input readonly&gt;
element specifically and in markup rather than disabling a parent
&lt;fieldset&gt;?

&gt;&gt;<i>Considering the fact that greater than 90% of browser users don't even 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have a browser that can edit otherwise static content
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just visit javascript:document.designMode=true to make any document 
</I>&gt;<i> editable in IE. (Untested, I might have the wrong syntax.)
</I>
:<i>editable.
</I>
