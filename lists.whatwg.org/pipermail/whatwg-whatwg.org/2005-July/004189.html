Cool. In that case I look forward to a Schematron HTML5 conformance 
checker.

Just out of interest, how would you do the second one above? Making sure 
that in any one document, there is only one &lt;dfn&gt; for each term defined? 

The relevant part of the spec being:

|<i> Defining term: If the dfn element has a title attribute, then the exact 
</I>|<i> value of that attribute is the term being defined. Otherwise, if it 
</I>|<i> contains exactly one element child node and no child text nodes, and 
</I>|<i> that child element is an abbr element with a title attribute, then the 
</I>|<i> exact value of that attribute is the term being defined. Otherwise, it 
</I>|<i> is the exact textContent of the dfn element that gives the term being 
</I>|<i> defined. [...]
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> There must only be one dfn element per document for each term defined 
</I>|<i> (i.e. there must not be any duplicate terms). 
</I>
It's simple to implement that in, e.g., a dedicated perl-based conformance 
checker, but I have no idea how you'd do that in Schematron.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Generic XML editors like XXE have support for using a schema to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; guide the editing process, but have no knowledge specific to a given 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; language like XHTML. These tools, and other generic XML tools, will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not be able to recognize the IDness of the 'id' attribute if it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not possible to express this in a schema.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As mentioned, that will be the least of their problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, fantasai is right, I can see this being a FAQ, for no obvious 
</I>&gt;<i> technical reason.
</I>
You seriously think that nested templates will be common enough for this 
to be a FAQ? Wow. A few months ago people were saying that this would be 
so rarely used that we should take it out!


&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't want to use &quot;:&quot; at all because of the way that character has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; special meaning for namespaces these days.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;These days&quot; being six years by now, striving and succesful, I think we 
</I>&gt;<i> just have to live with it :)
</I>
Oh I have nothing against it, I was just explaining why I didn't use &quot;:&quot;.
