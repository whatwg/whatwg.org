Amongst the tools that have been mentionned was Schematron. Out of the 
box Schematron can't check a media type, but with a very trivial to 
write extension function it could. All the rest that you mention seems 
very much doable. Schematron is built on XPath, which is a very useful 
and powerful little language.

&gt;<i> There are also things which will probably require warnings from 
</I>&gt;<i> conformance checkers, e.g. violations of SHOULD requirements, including 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. making sure the appropriate &lt;hx&gt; header is used in sections.
</I>
Schematron can warn. You could even define warning levels and optionally 
look for a lot of issues, even just provide some informative messages 
for what might be bad practices.

&gt;&gt;<i>Generic XML editors like XXE have support for using a schema to guide 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the editing process, but have no knowledge specific to a given language 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>like XHTML. These tools, and other generic XML tools, will not be able 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to recognize the IDness of the 'id' attribute if it's not possible to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>express this in a schema.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned, that will be the least of their problems.
</I>
No, fantasai is right, I can see this being a FAQ, for no obvious 
technical reason.

&gt;<i> Sigh. Can someone please explain why there is a completely ridiculous 
</I>&gt;<i> restriction on the values of IDs???
</I>
IDs are names. I don't like the restriction either but it's there and 
I'd much better handle it than ignore it. In fact, since it's a 
restriction inherited from SGML HTML-the-SGML-application has it as 
well, it just so happens that that's not the way most recent browsers 
have implemented it.

&gt;<i> Next I was going to use U+02AD .. U+02AC, but since these are new 
</I>&gt;<i> characters, they're only in XML 1.1, not XML 1.0. I presume _that_ is a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem for everyone as well?
</I>
I have no problem relying on XML 1.1 characters, I would say go ahead so 
long as they are name chars.

&gt;<i> I didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> want to use &quot;:&quot; at all because of the way that character has special 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning for namespaces these days.)
</I>
&quot;These days&quot; being six years by now, striving and succesful, I think we 
just have to live with it :)
