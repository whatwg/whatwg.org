XMLHTTP in IE is fully wired into the cache, and works appropriately,
I can't see how the behaviour will differ in different caching
scenarios in any case.  IE also returns the exact status code recieved
from the server.

It does if the cache is appropriately configured.

</I>
I don't see how hobbling smaller browsers helps them in any way.  I
also certianly don't see the point in writing a specification just for
smaller browsers, but we've discussed that before.

</I>
I've deployed a number of systems that rely on getting a 304 response
to the xmlhttp request object - Generally the client has been polling
a server for the state of a remote thing (the example most recently in
my mind was the temp of a freezer) and if it's not changed since the
last response, then I quite rightly send a 304, and test for it on the
client,  it was an embedded IE solution, and it worked fine in IE.

Cheers,

Jim.
