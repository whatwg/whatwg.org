Uh, yes, that's why I'm trying to resolve this... I still stand by my 
statement above that this won't affect most people.

Even if it does affect a lot of people.

You seem to be arguing against something I never said.


&gt;<i> &gt; Actually I expect most authors to never even remotely come close to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this problem, since you only hit it if you are doing _all_ of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  1. Using repetition blocks with the template name substitution feature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  2. Nesting such templates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  3. Using the XML serialisation of HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  4. Trying to use tools that are based on XML DTDs or XML Schemas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need 4 to be true, and not necessarily 3 either. Whenever I 
</I>&gt;<i> write small and silly Perl scripts to handle HTML documents on a box the 
</I>&gt;<i> way Joe Sysadmin would I tend to use whatever's best in that toolbox, 
</I>&gt;<i> and as it happens a lot of those tools are just XML parsers that happen 
</I>&gt;<i> to also know how to parse HTML
</I>
You do need 4 to be true. And 3.

You need 4 to be true because if you aren't validating, then it doesn't 
matter than the ID is not valid -- it's still well-formed and the UA will 
therefore handle it fine.

You need 3 to be true because if you are using an HTML5 UA, then it must 
handle these IDs. If it doesn't it's buggy.


&gt;<i> even though they might not be trying to be completely compliant (but 
</I>&gt;<i> they're &quot;on my box&quot; tools, so why should I care? I don't want them to be 
</I>&gt;<i> as complicated as browsers are).
</I>
Supporting all characters in IDs seems easier than supporting an arbitrary 
subset. So being compliant to HTML5 seems like it would reduce complexity.

But in any case, the argument &quot;but you can't do that, UAs might not be 
compliant&quot; seems somewhat strange in the context of making the spec.


&gt;<i> It's likely that arbitrary incompatibilities will make at least some of 
</I>&gt;<i> them unhappy, for reasons unobvious to their users.
</I>
Are you aware of any tools that actually have a problem dealing with IDs 
that contain [ ] characters?


&gt;<i> IMHO no matter how many syntaxes HTML 5 has, they should all be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> encode the same information. Otherwise people will be having to chose 
</I>&gt;<i> between them for the wrong reasons.
</I>
HTML5-as-XML can encode SVG.

HTML5-as-HTML can't.

I don't see any way to change that.
