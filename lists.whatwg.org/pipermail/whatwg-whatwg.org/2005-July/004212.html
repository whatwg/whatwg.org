And what about features that are not part of the spec? For example,
if an HTML5 document includes elements and attributes (such as &lt;blink&gt;
or &lt;meta scheme=&quot;..&quot;&gt;) that are not described in your specifications,
is it still conforming?

&gt;<i> People will be encouraged to write documents listing the differences 
</I>&gt;<i> between HTML5 and older versions of HTML, XHTML, and the HTML DOM when 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 is stable, but there's no way HTML5 can include this information as 
</I>&gt;<i> it would be a massive undertaking (only a small fraction of the hundreds 
</I>&gt;<i> of elements, attribute, properties, methods, and interfaces that could be 
</I>&gt;<i> included in the name of backwards-compatibility are being included).
</I>
Given that your spec claims to represent a later version of HTML and not
some unrelated language (and even uses XHTML 1.0's namespace), I think a
mention of any major changes from HTML 4.0 / XHTML 1.0 is nonetheless in
order. A full description of the changes and expansions is not necessary,
and would indeed be impractical, but you should call readers' attention
to changes that will affect migration from conforming HTML 4 Strict to
conforming HTML 5. For example, the requirement that &lt;meta http-equiv&gt;
only be used to express content encoding and only be placed as the first
element in &lt;head&gt; will make many conforming HTML 4 documents invalid
HTML 5.

Not having the time to compile such a list is no excuse for not having
one in the spec, as this is something that members of the discussion list
can certainly write /for/ you as an Appendix. (Such an exercise would
probably be best done at a more stable point in WA1's lifecycle, though.)
