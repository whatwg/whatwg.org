As fantasai said, RNG+Schematron will be much easier, but yeah they make 
for a great validation combo.

&gt;<i> Just out of interest, how would you do the second one above? Making sure 
</I>&gt;<i> that in any one document, there is only one &lt;dfn&gt; for each term defined? 
</I>
Completely untested and looking scary as a regex, but off the top of my 
head the following should do the trick. Inside a &lt;rule&gt; matching your 
&lt;dfn&gt;, you use &lt;let&gt; to set $title to:

@title |
.[not(@title) and count(./*|text()) == 1]/abbr/@title |
string(.[not(@title) and (not(abbr/@title) or count(./*|text()) != 1)])

which should make it contain the value of the string used for the 
current &lt;dfn&gt;. Then you put the following in an &lt;assert&gt; inside that rule:

preceding::dfn[@title] != $title and
preceding::dfn[
                not(@title) and abbr/@title and (count(./*|text()) == 1)
               ]/text() != $title and
string(preceding::dfn[
                      not(@title) and
                      (not(abbr/@title) or (count(./*|text()) != 1))
                     ]) != $title

&gt;<i> The relevant part of the spec being:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | Defining term: If the dfn element has a title attribute, then the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> | value of that attribute is the term being defined. Otherwise, if it 
</I>&gt;<i> | contains exactly one element child node and no child text nodes, and 
</I>&gt;<i> | that child element is an abbr element with a title attribute, then the 
</I>&gt;<i> | exact value of that attribute is the term being defined. Otherwise, it 
</I>&gt;<i> | is the exact textContent of the dfn element that gives the term being 
</I>&gt;<i> | defined. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | There must only be one dfn element per document for each term defined 
</I>&gt;<i> | (i.e. there must not be any duplicate terms). 
</I>
&gt;<i> It's simple to implement that in, e.g., a dedicated perl-based conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> checker, but I have no idea how you'd do that in Schematron.
</I>
In Perl, one would use some XPath :) Though in Perl one may be combining 
smaller XPath expressions with a hash to the same effect (I'm unsure 
that would be the clearest way of writing it though).

&gt;<i> You seriously think that nested templates will be common enough for this 
</I>&gt;<i> to be a FAQ? Wow. A few months ago people were saying that this would be 
</I>&gt;<i> so rarely used that we should take it out!
</I>
See fantasai's answer, I fully agree with her.
