I disagree.

It's been said that no one will use these except people who write about 
this kind of thing on their weblogs. I think this is for a very 
important reason: people are lazy, and they don't want to do any more 
than they have to to get the job done. In the case of a paragraph with a 
list inside of it, *the semantics are imparted by the natural language 
of the document*. If I write &quot;...an egg, flour, and butter...&quot;, I don't 
need to write &lt;ul&gt;, because it's already a list. And since I don't need 
to, I won't.

HTML should not attempt to describe language, because no one will use it.

&gt;<i>   * &lt;menu&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   * &lt;table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   * &lt;pre&gt; 
</I>
These I also disagree with, for a different reason having to do with the 
semantics of the &lt;p&gt; element.

As much as we tell people that &quot;&lt;p&gt; doesn't mean 'line break', it means 
'paragraph'!&quot;, that's not true. &lt;p&gt; doesn't mean &quot;paragraph&quot;, it means 
&quot;a standalone block of text&quot;. This is true everywhere on the internet: 
the w3c specs, the current work of the whatwg specs, my webpages, and 
I'm sure the webpages of everyone else here.

And this is better than having it mean &quot;paragraph&quot;. Like I said before, 
HTML should not attempt to describe language. Plus, a document 
description language like HTML needs a &quot;standalone block of text&quot; 
element. If &lt;p&gt; is reappropriated to actually mean paragraph, then HTML 
won't have one.

This is the case for &lt;blockquote&gt; in &lt;p&gt;, too. If a blockquote is in a 
paragraph, that's something that natural language describes, not HTML. I 
  don't think &lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; should be allowed.


P.S.: Sorry for being 3 months late to the discussion. I'm 600 mails 
behind now, trying to catch up. Also sorry if this thread has come up 
elsewhere, I didn't see it in the subjects.
