</I>
What would be more practical, and I think Henri will agree with this,
would be a RelaxNG schema with embedded Schematron to handle what the
RelaxNG grammar cannot. Schematron is very powerful, but this comes
at the cost of usability. A full Schematron schema for HTML 5 would
be, I suspect, an unecessarily painful project. It would also not be
useful for anything besides conformance-checking. (Schematron is a
rule-based schema language, as opposed to a grammar-based one. You
basically write a lot of asserts against XPath expressions.) Grammar-
based schemas like RelaxNG are easier to use for other things (like
guiding the editing process).

&gt;<i> Just out of interest, how would you do the second one above? Making sure 
</I>&gt;<i> that in any one document, there is only one &lt;dfn&gt; for each term defined? 
</I>
I'm no XPath expert, but basically, if you can write an XPath expression
that returns true when there's more than one &lt;dfn&gt; element with the same
term, then you can write a Schematron rule that checks for this.

&gt;<i> The relevant part of the spec being:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>...
&gt;<i> | There must only be one dfn element per document for each term defined 
</I>&gt;<i> | (i.e. there must not be any duplicate terms). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's simple to implement that in, e.g., a dedicated perl-based conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> checker, but I have no idea how you'd do that in Schematron.
</I>
Now my question is, what if you need to define the same term twice?
E.g.
   In CSS, a &lt;dfn&gt;property&lt;/dfn&gt; is ...
   However, in XXX, a &lt;dfn&gt;property&lt;/dfn&gt; is ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Generic XML editors like XXE have support for using a schema to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>guide the editing process, but have no knowledge specific to a given 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>language like XHTML. These tools, and other generic XML tools, will 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>not be able to recognize the IDness of the 'id' attribute if it's 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>not possible to express this in a schema.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>As mentioned, that will be the least of their problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>No, fantasai is right, I can see this being a FAQ, for no obvious 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>technical reason.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You seriously think that nested templates will be common enough for this 
</I>&gt;<i> to be a FAQ? Wow. A few months ago people were saying that this would be 
</I>&gt;<i> so rarely used that we should take it out!
</I>
No, Ian, the frequency of templating IDs is irrelevant here. What is
relevant is that if you don't have an ID-compliant syntax for templating
IDs, and the spec expects that such templating nonetheless be possible,
then you can't have a schema that types the 'id' attribute as ID. The FAQ
would be &quot;Why aren't id attributes typed as ID in the DTD/schema so that
XXX works properly?&quot; and the answer would be &quot;Because we need to allow
these non-ID chars in the 'id' attribute so that templating is validly
possible.&quot;
