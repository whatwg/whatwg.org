    Yeah, and I can't really see a way around that. If you can change 
the z-order so that the parent window is above the child, you've already 
violated one standard UI convention regarding modal windows. So even if 
the modal nature of the dialog only applied to the HTML viewing area, 
back/next buttons and the address bar (and bookmarks, et cetera), which 
violates UI conventions right there, you'd still have the z-order 
issues. So the simplest way to go is to have chromeless windows instead 
of modal ones.

    However, in the scenario where chromeless windows are permitted, we 
still have to deal with tricks involving simulated chrome designed to 
trick the user and other stuff. We definitely need to decide how to 
handle chromeless windows.

&gt;&gt;<i>If you want to do that in a

    Thank you. It's important to point out that users may not be using 
chrome by accident. This is what I meant by &quot;user hostile&quot; in previous 
messages. Modal dialogs block access to the UI that the user needs to 
control the browser. The whole point is to limit user control so that 
your application doesn't need to be as robust and doesn't have to deal 
with multiple input scenarios. If the user MUST do something a specific 
way, then you don't have to write code for any other way the user might 
try to accomplish the task. It's shifting part of the cost of 
development from the developer to the user.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to keep the two discussions chromeless windows and 
</I>&gt;<i> modal dialogs separate, please?
</I>
    If you're talking about modal dialogs, chromeless windows have to 
come up because modal dialogs must be chromeless. However, the modal 
conversation can be put on hold until we figure out whether chromeless 
windows are acceptable in one form or another.
