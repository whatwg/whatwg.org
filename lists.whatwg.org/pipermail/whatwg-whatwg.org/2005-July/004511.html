</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Note that the text above was reviewed by the editor of the CSS3 UI spec 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>and given the all-clear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Of course he gave it the all clear. He's the one who wrote the disputed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>portion of the spec in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which disupted section of which spec?
</I>
For CSS:
   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/#pseudo-ro-rw">http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/#pseudo-ro-rw</A>

For WF2:
   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#relation">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#relation</A>

&gt;<i> If there is a dispute about a CSS spec, this is the wrong forum.
</I>&gt;<i> Please move such discussions to www-style, 
</I>&gt;<i> where the discussions have a greater-than-zero chance of actually causing 
</I>&gt;<i> the CSS specs to change. :-)
</I>
   True, which is why I moved part of this discussion to www-style
already. However, what I'm trying to address is your recent revision of WF2.

&gt;<i> If the disputed section is the one I wrote (i.e. the one quoted above) 
</I>&gt;<i> then no, he didn't; I wrote it.
</I>
   I never said he wrote it. You altered WF2 to make it repeat aspects
of what he wrote (CSS3-UI). Obviously the person who wrote the sections
of the CSS3-UI spec you're drawing from is going to agree with
corrections that reinforce his own content.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I recommend sending your comments to www-style. As far as WHATWG goes, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>we have to take CSS3 UI as gospel and work from there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Even so, you could simply refer generally to CSS specifications 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>without restating their content. By restating content, you make the spec 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>potentially incompatible with future revisions of the CSS3-UI spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that CSS3 UI is not clear enough to lead to interoperable 
</I>&gt;<i> specifications in the context of WF2. Thus, it is my responsibility, as 
</I>&gt;<i> editor of WF2, to clarify how the specs interact. As editor, I also take 
</I>&gt;<i> on the responsibility of tracking future revisions of CSS3UI to ensure 
</I>&gt;<i> they do not break us, and that WF2 is updated to track CSS3UI changes. 
</I>&gt;<i> (The same applies to all WF2's dependencies.)
</I>
   What was wrong with the revision I suggested?...

|<i> Matches form control elements that have the readonly attribute set,
</I>|<i> and to which the readonly attribute applies (thus radio buttons will
</I>|<i> never match this, regardless of the value of the attribute), as well
</I>|<i> as other elements defined by this specification that are defined as
</I>|<i> read-only under the CSS3 Basic User Interface Module.
</I>
   There's no reason to rewrite parts of WF2 if it's written to avoid
such problems in the first place.

&gt;&gt;<i>In a scenario with script, when would you disable the &lt;input readonly&gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>element specifically and in markup rather than disabling a parent 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;fieldset&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There might not be a parent &lt;fieldset&gt;. In any case, what's the 
</I>&gt;<i> difference?
</I>
   So, when am I going to need to disable a single read-only control
independently of other controls? Not seeing a use case here.
