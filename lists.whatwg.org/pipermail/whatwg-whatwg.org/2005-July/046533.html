Note that people who write weblogs are an important part of our target 
market, by the way. A minority in the real world but still an important 
one, because they are often at the cutting edge. If bloggers use a 
technology a lot, then it is quite likely that it will cause others to use 
it as well. (RSS is an example of this.)


&gt;<i> I think this is for a very important reason: people are lazy, and they 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to do any more than they have to to get the job done. In the 
</I>&gt;<i> case of a paragraph with a list inside of it, *the semantics are 
</I>&gt;<i> imparted by the natural language of the document*. If I write &quot;...an 
</I>&gt;<i> egg, flour, and butter...&quot;, I don't need to write &lt;ul&gt;, because it's 
</I>&gt;<i> already a list. And since I don't need to, I won't.
</I>
Absolutely. I totally agree. The main use case is for marking up cases 
where one would have written:

   &lt;p&gt;Bla bla bla:&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bla,&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bla, and&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bla&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;...bla bla bla.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a structure I use a lot in e-mails, for instance. In this case, it 
is clear that the sentence spans more than one &lt;p&gt;, but the sentence is 
still just one semantic paragraph. Hence the list is in the paragraph, and 
thus the &lt;ul&gt; should be too.


&gt;<i> &gt;   * &lt;menu&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * &lt;table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * &lt;pre&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These I also disagree with, for a different reason having to do with the
</I>&gt;<i> semantics of the &lt;p&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As much as we tell people that &quot;&lt;p&gt; doesn't mean 'line break', it means 
</I>&gt;<i> 'paragraph'!&quot;, that's not true. &lt;p&gt; doesn't mean &quot;paragraph&quot;, it means 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a standalone block of text&quot;. This is true everywhere on the internet: 
</I>&gt;<i> the w3c specs, the current work of the whatwg specs, my webpages, and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure the webpages of everyone else here.
</I>
The current work of the WHATWG specs says:

   A paragraph is typically a block of text with one or more sentences 
   that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can also be used 
   for more general thematic grouping. For instance, an address is also a 
   paragraph, as is a part of a form, a byline, or a stanza in a poem.

...which seems clear enough to me. Incidentally, this is an example of one 
paragraph, starting at &quot;The current work&quot; and ending at &quot;in the middle&quot;, 
including the blockquote in the middle.


&gt;<i> P.S.: Sorry for being 3 months late to the discussion. I'm 600 mails 
</I>&gt;<i> behind now, trying to catch up. Also sorry if this thread has come up 
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere, I didn't see it in the subjects.
</I>
Don't worry. I will be returning to many of these topics once the WA1 spec 
is in more solid shape. At the moment I am attempting to flesh out first 
drafts for all the new features, so that I can get implementation feedback 
on those bits. As was requested by members of the list, I will only be 
returning to the more semantic sides of the discussion after the newer 
&quot;applicationy&quot; bits are written.
