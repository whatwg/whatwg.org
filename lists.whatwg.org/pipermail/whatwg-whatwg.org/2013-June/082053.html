I _think_ the issue is poorly-designed detection APIs that do the 
detection even if the consumer of the framework/library doesn't care 
about that particular feature.

That means that right now those frameworks are doing a getContext() call 
but then no one cares that they did.

</I>
I think the argument here is that the common case for getContext is in 
fact more and more the success case.  So the framework/library is 
wasting time successfully creating a context that no one actually cares 
about.

If the above is correct, I agree with Benoit: the right fix is to fix 
the libraries to do the getContext() lazily when someone actually asks 
whether WebGL is enabled.

If I'm wrong, then I'd like to understand what problem we _are_ trying 
to solve.  That is, what the cases are that want to check that they can 
create a context but not actually create one.
