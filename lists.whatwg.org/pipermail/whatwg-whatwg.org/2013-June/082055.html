This is missing the point.  You don't want to wait until it's actually
time to create the context.  Unless you torture your code flow, by the
time you're creating a context you should already know that the
context is supported.  The knowledge of which context to use is most
useful well before that, when you're first entering the app.

Plus, it doesn't matter how late you do the detection - if you do a
straight *detection* at all rather than an initialization (that is, if
you throw away the context you've just created for testing), you'll
still incur the start-up costs of spinning up a context.  Doing that
early or late doesn't matter too much - it's bad either way.

Like @supports, the supportsContext() method can be easy and reliable
with a very simple definition for &quot;supports&quot; - it returns true if
calling getContext() with the same arguments would return a context
rather than erroring, and false otherwise.  No capacity for lying
there without breaking sites.
