</I>&gt;<i> Yes. The use case begins with a markup generator that does not have a

</I>&gt;<i> alt attribute.^[1]
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> Without the required alt-attribute the generator's output is 
</I>&gt;<i> non-conforming or &quot;invalid&quot; markup.
</I>
More importantly, it's not accessible markup. That is why it's not 
conforming.


&gt;<i> It seems that (or at least markup generator creators seem to think that) 
</I>&gt;<i> a notable amount of users prefer generators that produce output which 
</I>&gt;<i> passes conformance checker tests over those which produce output that 
</I>&gt;<i> gets big red error marks. This can pressure markup generator creators to 
</I>&gt;<i> trick conformance checkers into thinking their output was conforming. 
</I>&gt;<i> Methods to achieve this include using bogus alt-texts or empty 
</I>&gt;<i> alt-texts, suggesting a purely presentational image when it's actually 
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>
Indeed. That's why we added the non-conforming but validator-silencing 
attribute &quot;generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt&quot;.


&gt;<i> These methods are in a way successful as conformance checkers today fall 
</I>&gt;<i> for the tricks. However, these tricks are considered harmful for 
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> (a) &quot;The img element has a title attribute with a value that is not the 
</I>&gt;<i> empty string (also as described above).&quot;^[3]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A title attribute text is usually not available to the light-weight 
</I>&gt;<i> markup converter I maintain. This applies to other markup generators as 
</I>&gt;<i> well: An OCR digitizer does not find something equivalent to the typical 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of the title attribute (i.e. a mouse-over text) in a book 
</I>&gt;<i> scan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While my markup generator usually has access to a caption for an image 
</I>&gt;<i> that is immediately visible to anyone and which could theoretically be 
</I>&gt;<i> included as title attribute, that would mean redundant text as in the 
</I>&gt;<i> following example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;tree.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Tree in Fantasia&quot;&gt; Tree in 
</I>&gt;<i> Fantasia&lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've actually seen captions re-used for title or alt attributes like 
</I>&gt;<i> this quite often in the wild. I do not consider this a desirable output. 
</I>&gt;<i> Why should visually impaired persons have to read everything twice?
</I>
Indeed, this would not be good usage. That's what &lt;figure&gt;/&lt;figcaption&gt; is 
intended to avoid.


&gt;<i> (b) &quot;The img element is in a figure element that &#8230;&quot;^[3] has a figcaption
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So now to the question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand why &lt;figure&gt; as defined in the WHATWG spec doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work for your case. What does the page look like?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem for markup generators is that they do not understand how the 
</I>&gt;<i> pages look like exactly. My light-weight markup converter has to use 
</I>&gt;<i> solutions that work in many cases, favorable and less favorable ones. 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this applies to other markup generators as well. They don't 
</I>&gt;<i> understand the semantics implied in the text they handle. I'll provide 
</I>&gt;<i> two examples in pseudo code -- the task for the markup generator is to 
</I>&gt;<i> translate it into HTML. Example 1:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | The funny finch is a well known bird of Fantasia.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | [fig src=&quot;funny-finch.jpg&quot;]Fig 1.: Funny finch on a fig twig[/fig]
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | It frolics freely in Fantasias famous forests.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | [fig src=&quot;feeding.jpg&quot;]Fig. 2.: Funny finch feeding a fledgling[/fig]
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | The funny finch feeds on fruits and flies (fig. 2). Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> | reforestation, the funny finch population has flourished in the past
</I>&gt;<i> | fourty years (fig. 3).
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | [fig src=&quot;demographics.png&quot;]Fig. 3: Finch population 1970--2010[/fig]
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | The funny finch is closely related to the freaky finches of Florida.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The figure element with a figcaption is perfectly suitable for the 
</I>&gt;<i> images in example 1.
</I>
Indeed, this, apart from the lacking alternative text, is a good structure 
to use for the Web.


&gt;<i> Let's look at example 2:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | The funny finch is a well known bird of Fantasia.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | [fig src=&quot;funny-finch.jpg&quot;]Funny finch on a fig twig[/fig]
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | It frolics freely in Fantasias famous forests.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | [fig src=&quot;feeding.jpg&quot;]Funny finch feeding a fledgling[/fig]
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | The funny finch feeds on fruits and flies, as shown in the photograph
</I>&gt;<i> | above. Thanks to reforestation, the funny finch population has
</I>&gt;<i> | flourished in the past fourty years, which the following diagram
</I>&gt;<i> | illustrates.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | [fig src=&quot;demographics.png&quot;]Finch population 1970--2010[/fig]
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | The funny finch is closely related to the freaky finches of Florida.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example 2 is conveying the same message as example 1. They almost look 
</I>&gt;<i> the same. However, while moving all the figures to the bottom of the 
</I>&gt;<i> page won't break example 1, example 2 will suffer badly from it. In 
</I>&gt;<i> example 2 figures are referenced by their location, whereas they are 
</I>&gt;<i> referenced by tokens in example 1.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> As I understand the WHATWG HTML spec, the figure element is not suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> in example 2. And hence it is not usable for any markup generators that 
</I>&gt;<i> do not understand human written texts well enough to differentiate 
</I>&gt;<i> between the two cases. Even some people coding HTML by hand will 
</I>&gt;<i> probably have difficulties to do it always right.
</I>
That's probably true, yes.


&gt;<i> The reason why I think example 2 does not conform with the spec is the 
</I>&gt;<i> following paragraph from WHATWG HTML spec 4.5.11:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, 
</I>&gt;<i> photos, code listings, etc, that are referred to from the main content 
</I>&gt;<i> of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the 
</I>&gt;<i> document, be moved away from that primary content, e.g. to the side of 
</I>&gt;<i> the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The paragraph starts with a &quot;can&quot;, indicating options. Then it continues 
</I>&gt;<i> with a &quot;but&quot; clause, which negates the optional character making the 
</I>&gt;<i> following words normative until &quot;e.g.&quot; again switches to listing 
</I>&gt;<i> options. The normative part is that figures must be movable away from 
</I>&gt;<i> the primary content without affecting the flow of the document. They 
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to be moved, hence the word &quot;could&quot;, but it must be possible 
</I>&gt;<i> without breaking anything. Did I understand that correctly?
</I>
Yes.

I've changed the spec to make &lt;figure&gt; applicable to your use case as 
well, and added more text to explain various use cases and whether they 
apply to &lt;figure&gt;. Let me know if the new text is still problematic for 
your use case. I agree that it would be overly restrictive to limit 
&lt;figure&gt; in the case you are presenting.


&gt;<i> (d) &quot;The img element has a (non-conforming) 
</I>&gt;<i> generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt attribute whose value is the 
</I>&gt;<i> empty string.&quot;^[3]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that is an option for any use case a markup generator runs into. 
</I>&gt;<i> But it seems unattractive in all its verbosity to me.
</I>
It's supposed to be a little unattractive, to discourage authors from 
using it to silent validators complaining about their hand-written pages 
(where they should just provide the fricking replacement text).


&gt;<i> Unfortunately -- although its verbosity is there to prevent any 
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding for its use -- it might leave the impression that a 
</I>&gt;<i> generator writing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is not as good as a generator writing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; alt=&quot;an image&quot;&gt;
</I>
Indeed. I don't know of a way to fix that. It's always going to be the 
case that a generator doing the wrong thing in a way that is 
machine-readably indistinguishable from the right thing is more likely to 
look correct at a quick glance than a generator that is doing the wrong 
thing in a machine-detectable way. I don't know what we can do about that.

I'm open to suggestions.


&gt;<i> &gt; If what you want is just an inline image followed by some text, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though, you don't need &lt;figure&gt; or title=&quot;&quot; -- you can just put in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; image and the text, as in:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;img src=&quot;the image&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- FIXME: replacement text is missing --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;p&gt;More text...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This causes big red error messages in conformance checkers which could 
</I>&gt;<i> in theory motivate users of some markup generators to learn HTML and add 
</I>&gt;<i> lots of alt-attributes to fix all these errors, but in practice leads to 
</I>&gt;<i> markup generators using inappropriate attributes to silence conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> checkers.
</I>
Yeah.


&gt;<i> In my case it is not applicable anyway: The converter generates markup 
</I>&gt;<i> for instant display -- the output is not saved to be edited.
</I>
Doesn't mean that it's not still bad that it's inaccessible, of course. :-)
