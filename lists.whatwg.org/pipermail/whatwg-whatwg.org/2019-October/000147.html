</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So on the whole, I don&#8217;t think Chrome engineers do as good a job as they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could of actively soliciting signals. Members of the WebKit team at Apple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are usually happy to provide an opinion if asked, or at least point to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone who can give an informed opinion. We also make sure to sync
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internally on things like this, to be able to give relatively official
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seconding Yoav's question - what would be the best way for us to write into
</I>&gt;<i> the Blink process to do this?  I think &quot;quote any member of the Webkit team
</I>&gt;<i> you can get to make a statement in public&quot; has multiple failure modes, so I
</I>&gt;<i> want to make sure we're pointing to (as you put it) relatively official
</I>&gt;<i> opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It&#8217;s possible that this is a Blink process problem, and that maybe &#8220;no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signals&#8221; should be accompanied by a record of the lack of signal and/or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempt to solicit one, to remind Blinkers to actively ask. Assuming that&#8217;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the intention of the signals section.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We just had a conversation on precisely this topic, and I expressed the
</I>&gt;<i> concern that embedding a record of our attempts to solicit opinions might
</I>&gt;<i> also be taken as shaming, which isn't our intent either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'm hearing:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   1. Blink needs to be more explicit about asking for signals.  It would
</I>&gt;<i>   be good to have those as repeatable channels at the various other platform
</I>&gt;<i>   implementation organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>   2. Blink needs to be more intentional about notifying when features are
</I>&gt;<i>   tracking to land, to put appropriate pressure on getting those signals
</I>&gt;<i>   (positive or negative).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It&#8217;s especially concerning that WICG does not require either multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation experience (like W3C WGs do) or multiple implementor support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like WHATWG does). As a result, single-implementation specifications with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no track to multi-engine implementation look exactly the same as incubation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects with multi-implementor support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to disagree with your concern, at least as an entry point.  The
</I>&gt;<i> whole point of starting incubations is that they may not have multiple
</I>&gt;<i> implementers interested in prototyping -but an incubation is not the end
</I>&gt;<i> point.  Certainly, as specs graduate from WICG incubations into an
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate WG (or the WHATWG) - their exit point from incubation - I would
</I>&gt;<i> expect multiple implementers to support and to be working on
</I>&gt;<i> implementations.
</I>
What&#8217;s lacking here is the clear indication between the two. For example, how does one supposed to figure out this intent to ship email was based on a feature not being reviewed by Mozilla or Apple? There should have been a clear indication that this is a single vendor feature in the spec itself.

I get that there needs to be some avenue to share ideas. But that avenue can&#8217;t be simultaneously something browser vendors use to claim that it&#8217;s a well accepted standard API.

&gt;<i> &quot;No track to multi-engine implementation&quot; can be only a matter of time and
</I>&gt;<i> priority, also.  I'm not against declaring more directly/publicly what
</I>&gt;<i> implementers are &quot;supporting&quot; (in quotes because there's not a precise
</I>&gt;<i> definition here) any given incubation, if we can come up with a way to do
</I>&gt;<i> so; would that help?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes we end up with specs using the WICG &#8220;Community Group Draft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Report&#8221; logo while in an individual&#8217;s personal repo rather than in WICG.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As Yoav said, I think this is a bug - much like putting the W3C editor
</I>&gt;<i> draft logo on a spec in a personal repo.  Misleading, at best.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think these are process problems with WICG.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am strongly against making a higher bar than &quot;multiple independent
</I>&gt;<i> parties are interested&quot; in order to start an incubation - because a bar
</I>&gt;<i> such as &quot;must have multiple implementers supporting&quot; would mean the vast
</I>&gt;<i> majority of incubations would be done effectively outside the community, in
</I>&gt;<i> personal or corporate repos, with no early contribution IP commitment or
</I>&gt;<i> outside engagement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I'm happy to talk about process improvements we can do in the
</I>&gt;<i> WICG - for example, I proposed above that we enable implementers to tag
</I>&gt;<i> their support in WICG repos.  Would that help?  Is there something else we
</I>&gt;<i> should change?
