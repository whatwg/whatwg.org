It's widespread _today_, such that UAs today can't change their behaviour. 
Thus we can't change the spec today.

If you reduced the volume of such usage, then it would be worth 
revisiting, but unless that happens, we're merely talking hypotheticals.

Personally I wouldn't be optimistic about the ability to change the legacy 
data; historically it has not been possible. I don't really know of any 
successful attempt, to the point where browsers historically have even 
tried using different processing modes -- the whole quirks mode thing -- 
to get around legacy content incompatible with the specifications.


&gt;<i> Are you able to analyze what proportion of those pages are hosted by the 
</I>&gt;<i> top, say, 10 hosters?
</I>
Not from my current data set, no.
