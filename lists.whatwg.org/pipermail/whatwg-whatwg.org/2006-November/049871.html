<PRE>Le 31 oct. 2006 &#224; 16:26, Henri Sivonen a &#233;crit :

&gt;&gt;<i> I know it has already been discussed, but I'd suggest this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What benefits do consumers of HTML get from knowing that something  
</I>&gt;<i> is a dialog?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What tangible benefits can authors see from marking up dialogs as  
</I>&gt;<i> dialogs? That is, what is the incentive to bother?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If most authors are not incentivized to mark up their dialogs as  
</I>&gt;<i> such, is there still enough value for consumers of markup if only  
</I>&gt;<i> relatively few dialogs are marked up as dialogs?
</I>
Those are legitimate questions.

People have asked how to markup dialogs for a long time, but many are  
reluctant to use &lt;dl&gt; because it is named &quot;definition list&quot; and a  
dialog has absolutely nothing to do with a definition list (basically  
a dialog does not define anything, and it isn't a list more than a  
couple of adjacent paragraphs form a list).

Well, if it comes that &lt;dl&gt; can be used for dialogs, fine. But I  
believe that introducing a &lt;dialog&gt; element will makes things  
clearer, as HTML4 has explicitly proposed the use of &lt;dl&gt; for dialogs  
and many people still find that dumb.

Is there a value in knowing something is a dialog? Not always, that's  
certain. But in certain contexts it is important for styling as  
there's no punctuation to tell what is a dialog and what is not.  
That's when &lt;dl&gt; was used.


&gt;<i> Why not just use punctuation for the quotations?
</I>
Indeed. I rarely use &lt;q&gt; myself. But I know other people who do. Why  
is there a &lt;q&gt; element in the first place? Sometimes I wonder.  
Picking up a different voice in screen readers could be one reason.

But now that I reread the spec, &lt;q&gt; is possibly inappropriate for  
dialogs: &quot;The &lt;q&gt; element represents a part of a paragraph quoted  
from another source&quot;. Does fictional  dialog speech qualifies for a  
quote from another source? I don't know. So maybe I should have used  
quotes characters instead of &lt;q&gt;.

And, for the same reasons, I'm not sure anymore that &lt;cite&gt; is  
appropriate in a dialog. Maybe it could be said that &lt;cite&gt; has a  
special meaning inside a &lt;dialog&gt; element.


&gt;<i> If printed text in French (and other languages) works with the  
</I>&gt;<i> dialog dash style
</I>&gt;<i> without visual hints where you put the &lt;q&gt; and &lt;/q&gt; tags, why would  
</I>&gt;<i> an author
</I>&gt;<i> want to go though the trouble of tagging the dialog like that and  
</I>&gt;<i> then making sure
</I>&gt;<i> that any styling on the &lt;q&gt; element is suppressed?
</I>
As &#216;istein suggested, text could be italicised (as some newspapers  
do), or as I suggested above it could be used to speak the text in  
another voice (which could be useful even in a novel). The &lt;q&gt;  
element may be inappropriate for dialogs however, both semantically  
(refers to another source?) and visually (automatically-inserted  
quotation marks). And thus these were my two points:

1.  there is no way to distinguish quoted text in a quotation from  
unquoted
     material inserted within the quotation marks;

2.  there is no way to identify a dialog, and to identify inside a  
dialog what
     is spoken text and what comes from the narrator (I made some  
mockups
     using &lt;q&gt; inside &lt;dialog&gt; in my first post, but my conclusion is  
that
     &lt;q&gt; doesn't seem appropriate for this, because of the quotes and  
possibly
     because of the semantics of &lt;q&gt;).

I'm not sure yet what could be proposed for this, but it'd be nice if  
a similar markup can be used for quotations and other spoken text.  
(And it'd be nice if such markup can work in Internet Explorer  
without ugly hacks. [1])

&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mary:&lt;/cite&gt; So where do you want to go tomorrow? I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can tell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        you already have something in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Mark:&lt;/cite&gt; What makes you think that?&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;/dialog&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is that better than &lt;dl&gt;?
</I>
And why is &lt;dl&gt; better than that?

If you don't care about semantics, they're probably equivalent: both  
have decent default styles. If you care about semantics, using &lt;dl&gt;  
for dialog removes every bit of meaning left in &lt;dl&gt; as &quot;an unordered  
list of associations&quot;.
