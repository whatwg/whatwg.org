</I>
Has it actually been checked how many people use an XHTML doctype and  
forget to use the trailing slashes on one or more elements?


&gt;<i> It is fair to conclude that that 33% (i.e., 50-17) of those that (in this
</I>&gt;<i> case incorrectly) assume that they are producing HTML use trailing  
</I>&gt;<i> slashes. In Ian's terminology, these people are confused.
</I>
Same here: do those documents use them occasionally or throughout?


&gt;<i> The first question I think we can answer fairly conclusively: of those  
</I>&gt;<i> 33%, how many will become &quot;un-confused&quot; if HTML5 does not permit trailing
</I>&gt;<i> slashes?  Hint: the version of HTML they are currently using already  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't permit trailing slashes.
</I>
The current version of HTML actually does, because it is in part based on  
SGML (and at the same time isn't according to some people). The meaning of  
a trailing slash there is, however, very different. Of course,  
validator.w3.org (most widely used validator I reckon), doesn't really  
tell you that.



&gt;<i> Path 1: HTML5 permits two authoring syntaxes, and the question as to  
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not trailing slashes are allowed is forever &quot;it depends&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I continue  to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain that most people don't understand DOCTYPEs, and will point to  
</I>&gt;<i> the 50% number above as being consistent with that contention.
</I>
It has to allow two authoring syntaxes. One HTML and one XML. I thought we  
were past that discussion?


&gt;<i> Path 2: HTML5 permits only one authoring syntax, and permits &quot;XML-style&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> notation only to the extent that such syntax wouldn't be interpreted in a
</I>&gt;<i> different manner by consumers that only understand HTML.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation
</I>&gt;<i> for HTML5 would contain examples of such cases, and any conformance  
</I>&gt;<i> checker would only point out such examples.
</I>
That only understand HTML??


&gt;<i> [...] For example, technically &apos; would fall on the wrong side the
</I>&gt;<i> argument, but as I can see from the current draft of HTML5, the right
</I>&gt;<i> decision was already made in that case.
</I>
The sole reason for that is that a couple of user agents support in HTML.
