All true, which is why properly written such systems should not spew out 
such apparent nonsense. It is easy to take the input from regular 
end-users who are not markup geeks or string theorists and transform it 
into proper, well-formed, even valid XHTML before republishing it. I was 
doing this years ago. It is trivial compared to some of the things 
WordPress is already doing.

Doing this does require a certain amount of markup-savvy in the part of 
implementers of content management and publishing systems. However, it 
is not unreasonable to expect these implementers to be markup geeks, or 
at the very least to be able to use excellent libraries like Tidy and 
TagSoup for this task.

Remember, almost all of the major systems are already refusing to accept 
arbitrary user input and raw HTML. Instead they:

1. Convert things like markdown to HTML.
2. Strip the HTML of potentially dangerous markup such as scripts.

I'm just suggesting that a third operation be added in which the HTML is 
passed through Tidy or TagSoup or equivalent. It's not like this is 
hard. Steps 1 and 2 are actually much more complicated and error prone.
