I wouldn't call that a very good metric for the purposes of this
discussion though, because I expect that the bulk of those pages are
produced by a handful of blog hosting services.  If we can shrink
&quot;100s of millions&quot; by 4 or 5 (or more) orders of magnitude with a
handful of persuasively written emails, then the situation is not what
I would call &quot;widespread&quot;.

Are you able to analyze what proportion of those pages are hosted by
the top, say, 10 hosters?

We'd also have to consider the aggregators too of course, which
consume that data.  That should also be manageable, although I expect
more work than for the data publishers.

Mark.
