0%. Allowing or disallowing something is completely orthogonal to how it 
is parsed.


&gt;<i> The basis for my question is the observation that the web browsers that

</I>&gt;<i> usage seems to have crept into quite a number of diverse places
</I>
Browsers don't do any sort of conformance reporting for HTML parsing, so 
they can't actually be said to be allowing it or disallowing it. As far as 
parsing goes, all browsers, as well as the HTML5 parsing specification, 
handle bogus trailing / characters in tags by ignoring them.


&gt;<i> As a side benefit of this change, I believe that I could modify my weblog to
</I>&gt;<i> be simultaneously both HTML5 and XHTML5 compliant
</I>
Since the namespace declaration is required in XML and disallowed in HTML, 
this is not possible. In addition, while you may be right that a tiny 
subset of XML might be equivalent to a tiny subset of HTML, it is not, and 
will never be, generally true that you can take an arbitrary HTML5 
document and treat it as XML. HTML5 has very detailed parsing rules (at 
least as detailed as XML, and arguably more detailed, since the HTML 
parsing rules define the tree you obtain from parsing, whereas XML parsing 
rules only state what a conformant document looks like and how to detect 
conformance errors, not how to turn a conformant document into a tree).

I'm not sure I really understand the value of having a single common 
syntax subset, either. Now that there is an unambiguous way of parsing 
HTML, converting HTML to XML and back again in a lossless manner is easy. 
(Though not trivial -- there are things that can be represented in one 
syntax and not the other, like namespaces in XML, and the &lt;noscript&gt; 
element in HTML.)


Regarding your original suggestion: based on the arguments presented by 
the various people taking part in this discussion, I've now updated the 
specification to allow &quot;/&quot; characters at the end of void elements.


There were many e-mails on this thread. I have replied to the salient 
points below. Since much the discussion focused not on specific HTML5 
proposals but on the pros and cons of XML, WordPress, and other 
technologies, I've not replied to all the e-mails. If you feel I have 
failed to reply to an e-mail that I should have replied to, please bring 
it to my attention.

I strongly agree with this.

</I>
This is already what we have -- the Web Apps 1.0 specification defines a 
single format, HTML5, with its syntax rules and parsing rules (including 
error handling). Serialisation to other formats is allowed, but not 
formally described by the Web Apps 1.0 specification. Due to its high 
profile, the serialisation that uses the XML syntax is explicitly 
addressed in the specification, and termed &quot;XHTML5&quot;.


&gt;<i> But before they do, this work group certainly can anticipate that 
</I>&gt;<i> question. What is the cost of accepting trailing slashes on elements 
</I>&gt;<i> which are always defined with a content model of empty, except when 
</I>&gt;<i> found in &quot;Attribute value (unquoted) state&quot;?  What sites would be parsed

</I>&gt;<i> how existing browsers actually behave, or at odds with this behavior?
</I>
Again, these questions seem to betray a misunderstanding as to how the 
specification works. Trailing slashes were always ignored, and this has 
not changed. The only change is in whether such slashes are reported as 
errors in the validator or not. Whether something is an error has no 
effect on how it is parsed.

I couldn't find this page, but are you saying browsers handle this case

We have no choice as to how it is handled -- &lt;select/&gt; has to be handled 
like &lt;select&gt;. It is an error. Parsers will ignore the &quot;/&quot;.


&gt;<i> Now this, '&lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;' -- which is what I thought this discussion

This is now true.

Well, &lt;div/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; is treated exactly the same as &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; (the / is 
ignored). And &lt;img/&gt; is treated exactly the same as &lt;img&gt; (again, the / is 
ignored). So the harm is that it doesn't do anything, and this would 
confuse authors.


&gt;<i> An example of something that is NOT implemented interoperably is

As far as I can tell, &lt;script/&gt; is handled by all browsers the same way as

Please do this all the time:

   &lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/b&gt;

About 50% have a trailing slash somewhere. It will be interesting to see 
what the statistics become with the modified tokenising requirements.

The above is _not_ allowed. Parsing rules for it are defined, just like 
they have always been for trailing / characters, but it is _not_ allowed.

This seems like a bad idea. If you have HTML, parse it as HTML. If you 
have XML, parse it as XML. Don't try to use an XML parser to parse HTML or 
vice versa. The syntaxes, although superficially similar to the extent 
that it is possible to make a single document that is parsable using 
either processor, are not similar enough to be treated equivalently.

A page authored as HTML4 will validate if it contains &lt;br /&gt;, since that 
means something qutie different, as you say, and what it means is valid.

In HTML5, and in the real world, &lt;br /&gt; is the same as &lt;br&gt;.

Yeah, application/xhtml+xml is about 0.0044% according to my studies.

Indeed; that's one of the reason HTML5 drops the HTML version number.

With the overwhelming majority of existing content, and with legacy 
browsers.


&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really understand this argument. Those who use XHTML1 because

Both, hopefully, will be true.

They're just differently serialisations. One is for text/html, the other

I don't really understand you logic, but for what it's worth, sending 
XHTML5 as text/html is non-conformant. You must send it as an XML MIME 
type. Of course, if you _do_ send XHTML5 as text/html, then it'll be 
treated as any other HTML, and all the various errors (like it being sent 
with the wrong MIME type) will be handled using the graceful error 
recovery rules of HTML5.
