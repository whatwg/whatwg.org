My idea was to allow custom elements only in contexts where such problems do not occur.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> non-XML characters [should not be allowed in HTML5]
</I>&gt;<i>For example, \0, form feed and U+FFFF
</I>
Right, I did not even dream of allowing such characters in names.

HTML 4.01 and XML 1.0 both disallow the surrogate characters U+D800&#226;&#128;&#147;U+DFFF,
as well as control characters &lt; 32 (except \t, \n and \r). Additionally, HTML 4.01
disallow the range U+7F&#226;&#128;&#147;U+9F, and XML 1.0 the characters U+FFFE and U+FFFF.

I was therefore surprised to realise that the current HTML5 draft seems to allow any
character except \0. Unless I have missed something, the character repertoire
should probably be restricted somewhat, possibly to the common subset allowed
in both HTML 4.01 and XML 1.0'.

&gt;<i> Actually, I should have said that the minimum condition that I think is 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for a name of a custom attribute or element to be reasonable is that
</I>&gt;<i> the name matches the NCName production from Namespaces in XML 1.0
</I>
I agree with the intention that names should be restricted to (mostly) letters and
digits, and this is probably the only usable definition we will get any time soon.

&gt;<i> and only contains characters from the Basic Latin (ASCII) block.
</I>
Is this because of case-folding issues? Unless there are other problems, an
alternative would be to let non-7-bit characters be case-sensitive (with a strong
warning against using names that only differ in case).

&gt;&gt;<i> I [...] find it unfortunate that custom attributes are not allowed in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conforming HTML5 document.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not necessarily follow that custom attributes have to be conforming.
</I>
Well, no, not *necessarily*, but features that are useful universally implemented
already and do not involve particular problems, should probably have a chance
to make their way into HTML5.
