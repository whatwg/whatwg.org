Let the page screw up. The author will notice it and fix it. That's like 
saying some people mistype table as tabel and therefore we shoudl accept 
both spellings.

Can you elaborate on the specifics? If it's their custom office 
namespaces, I'm not too surprised.

</I>

I'm sorry. Those reasons are *TRIVIAL*. They are easily handled, and 
easily fixed. This isn't even close to some of the other things that 
have been successfully introduced to th Web in the last 10 years like 
JavaScript, CSS, tables, or frames. This is like being scared of a 
mouse, while ignoring the ravenous tiger behind your back.

We need namespaces. XML tools just don't work without them, and XML 
tools are about the only thing most developers not working for browser 
vendors have that can process this stuff. In fact, I think developers 
have voted with their feet to adopt the XML toolchain as the sensible 
way to process HTML. We must not throw the entire community of people 
who want to write code to generate and process Web pages over the side 
just to make life a teeny bit easier for people who hand author HTML in 
text editors.
