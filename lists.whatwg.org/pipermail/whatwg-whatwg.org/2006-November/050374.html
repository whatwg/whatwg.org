I tentatively support the idea that trailing slashes on &quot;singleton&quot;[1] 
elements should not be a parse error. I don't think it has any actual 
technical merit but I think it will be helpful in getting developer 
mindshare; a lot of people have drunk the &quot;Zeldman Koolaid&quot; and have the 
ideas of XHTML, clean markup, CSS, and conformance to standards in 
general all mushed together in their brain[2]. For these people (who I 
think represent the upper quartile of web developers in terms of 
commitment to good markup) the trailing slash in empty elements is the 
syntax of a new generation - it is a symbol that represents everything 
that has changed in web design since 1996 - as intrinsically useless as 
a fashionable designer label but just as seductive.

[1] I find that name quite confusing as it suggests there should only be 
one in the entire document.

[2] c.f. the &quot;code is poetry&quot; comment in the Wordpress bug report 
despite the fact that most here would argue HTML 4 as text/html is 
considerably more poetic than XHTML as text/html.
