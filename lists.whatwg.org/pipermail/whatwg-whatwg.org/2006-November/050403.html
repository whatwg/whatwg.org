So far, the proposal is to have two syntaxes:

1) HTML5 - Backwards-compatible text/html syntax that allows trailing
slashes on always-empty elements.
2) XHTML5 - Full XML syntax with the proper mime type.

I am not sure where extensibility and namespaces would fit into that.
Perhaps they should be proposed independently of this.


Again, early adopters of CSS, validation, and semantic mark-up were
told a story. That story said that maintainability=&gt;no formatting in
HTML=&gt;CSS=&gt;XHTML=&gt;trailing backslashes on empty elements. That's not
true, but quibbling nets few converts. If we make trailing backslashes
invalid, then every bug report we file will say:
- Remove trailing backslashes. You can't serve XHTML like this.

That will invariably be rejected.

If we keep them valid on always-empty elements, then it'll be much nicer:
- HTML5 is the new hot thing. You shouldn't be serving XHTML as
text/html anyways. Switch doctypes, revalidate, and iteratively
improve markup

It's much easier to gain acceptance, agreement, buy-in, consensus on
the latter. The validation errors they'll see will actually help them
with browser compatibility.
