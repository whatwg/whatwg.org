Please keep your tone moderated and maintain a positive attitude when 
posting to the WHATWG mailing list. Being sarcastic or abrasive in the 
context of this community should not be tolerated.

Focussing on the issue at hand, I would recommend those taking part in the 
part of this discussion that relates to Math markup to suggest 
constructive solutions for how to move forward in a text/html world, 
preferably with proof-of-concepts or experimental implementations. It is 
clear that not everyone will be pleased with whatever solution we end up 
using, since the requirements put forward by the various contributors so 
far are at best quite different and at worst contradictory. However, if we 
have actual implementations to play with, we can at least try to base our 
decisions on experience rather than guesses and opinions.

Cheers,
