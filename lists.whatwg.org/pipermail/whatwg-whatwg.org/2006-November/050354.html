It is intentional, as a way of grandfathering widespread legacy practice.

I agree that it is suboptimal. I'm not sure how to cater to both the 
existing content and, moving forward, to allow Atom to be used with 
rel=alternate to mean &quot;alternate representation that isn't a feed&quot;.


&gt;<i> But it isn't a feed, and it isn't something you'd want syndication tools

</I>
Putting a real feed first would get around this, but you're right that in 
the case you described (and assuming no feed), there'd not really be a way 
to get around this other than simply not including the type=&quot;&quot; attribute.


&gt;<i> In addition, the media type on link is non-authoritative, meaning that 
</I>&gt;<i> feed-semantics would be inferred before it was even ascertained that the 
</I>&gt;<i> would-be representation was actually an Atom or RSS document.
</I>
Yeah. I think the spec is clear that the real MIME type overrides it once 
the file has been fetched; but again, existing practice constrains what we 
can do here.


In conclusion, I'm not sure we can do anything here. We're stuck between a 
rock and a hard place, as it were.
