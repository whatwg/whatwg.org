</I>
We can't do much about that, as far as I can see, regardless of whether we 
require it or not.


&gt;<i> The problem with allowing omission of alt depends on the meaning of 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt; without alt. If &lt;img&gt; without alt is defined to mean the same as 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt; with alt=&quot;&quot;, then the problem is that all cases when people omit 
</I>&gt;<i> the alt attribute because they don't care will end up with mangled 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> If &lt;img&gt; without alt is defined to mean that the image is semantically 
</I>&gt;<i> valuable but without an alternative text, then the problem is that we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to distinguish between empty and omitted alt in DOM somehow.
</I>
That's easy enough; the real problem is that we end up saying that 
literally billions of &lt;img&gt; tags are semantically valuable when in all 
likelihood they're just decorative images.

The number of &lt;img&gt; tags with a alt=&quot;&quot; attribute is about half the number 
of &lt;img&gt; tags with a src=&quot;&quot; attribute.

</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> In this case, height and width are inherent properties of the document 
</I>&gt;<i> if we consider the linked image as part of the document, much alike the 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;&quot; attribute on a link. Sure, we could use style=&quot;width: 32; 
</I>&gt;<i> height: 32&quot; instead of width=&quot;32&quot; height=&quot;32&quot;, but most of the time the 
</I>&gt;<i> size of an image isn't a matter of style, it's a matter of what the 
</I>&gt;<i> image is.
</I>
Right. However, height/width take %s as well, and can be set to values 
that don't match the image height/width. What do we do in those cases? How 
do we justify them?

</I>
Sure, but what about the jiggling? Do you really want people to set IDs on 
all their images and then have the stylesheet list all their images and 
give the height and width properties that way?
