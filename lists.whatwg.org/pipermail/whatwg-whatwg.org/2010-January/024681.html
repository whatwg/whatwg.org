<PRE>It sounds tempting to say that the postMessage should be queued until the
newly opened window is loaded, but what point in time is that exactly?  Is
that after the load event is dispatched on the newly opened window?

Note: a newly opened window can begin communicating with its opener much
earlier (via inline script execution).

However, if we try to dispatch the postMessage events before the load event
then the newly opened window may not have registered its event handlers yet.
 (A future &lt;script&gt; tag may define the event handler.)  So, I think we would
have to delay until the load event for the semantics to be sane.

There is perhaps a more critical issue that we should consider.  What
happens if the named window already exists?

Consider this case:

window.open(&quot;<A HREF="http://a/">http://a/</A>&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;);
...
var w = window.open(&quot;<A HREF="http://b/">http://b/</A>&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;);
w.postMessage(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);

I suspect the postMessage would be dispatched in this case, but the event
dispatch would probably go to the document at <A HREF="http://a/">http://a/</A> instead of <A HREF="http://b/.">http://b/.</A>
 This is because the browser has no way of knowing if <A HREF="http://b/">http://b/</A> will
actually be displayable content.  It could be of a mime type that should
just be downloaded (in which case the indicated window is not navigated).

So, queuing is probably not a good idea.  Workers do not have this issue
since they cannot be &quot;navigated&quot; like a window.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In the course of testing something today, I attempted to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; window and immediately post a message to it, and was surprised that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; didn't seem to work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; E.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; var w = window.open(&quot;<A HREF="http://x">http://x</A>&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; w.postMessage(&quot;hello, world&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; w never got the message - this seemed to be consistent across Safari,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Chrome, and FF (all I had installed on my Mac at the time, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; apologies to Opera, IE, and anyone else I've left out).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is this supposed to work? If not, is there a reliable way for the the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; source to know when it is safe to send a message to the target? The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; only way I can think of is for the target to send a message back to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the source, which only works if the target can get a reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; source using window.opener, which may or may not be possible or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; desirable ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If this isn't supposed to work, can we state this explicitly in the
</I>&gt;<i> spec?
