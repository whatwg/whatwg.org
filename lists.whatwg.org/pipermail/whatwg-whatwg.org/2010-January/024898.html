This one seems kind of weird.  Does the spec currently distinguish
significantly between a user-initiated click and a script-initiated
one?

&gt;<i> * disallow&#160;enterFullscreen() from a frame or iframe
</I>
Makes sense, though consider its interaction with sandboxed iframes
(that is, you may actually *want* the ability to turn on
fullscreen-ability for an iframe).

&gt;<i> * show an animation as the window enters fullscreen so the user can see the
</I>&gt;<i> transition taking place
</I>
How would this interact with an author hooking CSS Transitions to the
element keyed on the :fullscreen pseudoclass?  If we implement the
actual fullscreen effect essentially purely in CSS, I'd prefer the
minimum amount of magic here.

&gt;<i> * show an hard-to-spoof overlay with some text that tells the user that they
</I>&gt;<i> can use the Escape key to exit fullscreen, and prevent the page from
</I>&gt;<i> capturing this keypress.
</I>&gt;<i> * show an affordance to allow the user to exit fullscreen (e.g. a close
</I>&gt;<i> button) when the user moves the mouse
</I>
Both of these make a lot of sense to me, and match the way fullscreen
effects work today, so users will understand it.

&gt;<i> * make the location field available to the user so that they can see the URL
</I>&gt;<i> even when in fullscreen
</I>
This partially defeats the purpose of fullscreen.  ^_^  Though, it may
be worthwhile to do so anyway, as it would be a major indicator that
something is being spoofed.

&gt;<i> * drop out of fullscreen if navigating to another page
</I>
Sounds very reasonable.

&gt;<i> * if focussed on an element, drop out of fullscreen if that element is
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the DOM
</I>
Definitely a good idea.

&gt;<i> * limit arbitrary keyboard input unless 'enableKeys' is true
</I>
Already has some history, so would probably be a decent idea.

&gt;<i> * disallow window.open etc. while in fullscreen
</I>
I don't fully understand this restriction's justification.
