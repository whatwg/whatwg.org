Yes, replaceState solves bullets two and three above.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following would be a suitable chain of events:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - /a statedeactivated event
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - /a unload event
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - /a browser saves form fields, scrollpos, and history state obj

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; About &quot;pageStorage&quot; naming:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Scope               Storage area / identifier

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If anticipating there could be a future storage area per

</I>
I'll keep this short as there is more recent discussion:
1) The additional event is discussed later in this mail.
2) The pageStorage object is one incarnation of [a key
   value store] solving the dependency problem that appears
   when different components want to save data to the single
   session history state object

And the later part is more about general properties of
API design:
3) If a key-value store is desired, then using the same API 
   as the other key-value stores is a strength and not an over-
   generalisation. The web doesn't need yet another API.
4) Thinking about possible future additions when choosing
   names is one part (of many) of a successful design.

Right, missed that. Good, it seems correct that browser

This is about the current API forcing cooperation upon
different components that want to store state, and having
to carry an extra copy of the current state data.

Let's say that we have two components, A and B, that are
not aware of each other but both want to save state to the
history state.

The author could make an app-global save function that
connects to all update notifications from all components
and does:
  function saveItAll() {
    History.replaceState({
      A: A.serializeState(),
      B: B.serializeState()
    });
  }

The above has two drawbacks:
- the global function has to be maintained when components
  are added or removed
- even if only one component's data is updated (triggering
  the save function), all component serialization has to
  be executed even if not changed

Trying to fix this, we would want to set each part of the
state separately so each component can handle its own
updates:

  A.saveMe: function() {...}
  ...
  B.saveMe: function() {...}

and no global coordination would be needed. But the problem
is that when A.saveMe wants to store its latest data, it
must also have all other data, and to be able to have the
latest state we need a getter:

  A.saveMe: function() {
    var data = History.getState();
    data.A = A.serializeState();
    History.replaceState(data);
  }

With this solution components can have a loose cooperation
by just agreeing on a general data format (f ex map).
Without the getter, components can no longer use the History
API directly, but instead have to call through a wrapper
that caches the latest state in a variable:

  A.saveMe: function() {
    var data = MyHistoryWrapper.getState();
    data.A = A.serializeState();
    MyHistoryWrapper.replaceState(data);
  };
  MyHistoryWrapper.replaceState = function(data) {
    this.cache = data;
    History.replaceState(data);
  };

Now components not only have to cooperate on a data format,
but also on a non-standard API.

Of course this use case had been better served by a key-
value store like pageStorage mentioned above. But having a 
getter takes us at least halfway there.

The point here is that there are several frameworks for this,
and there will always be. This means that components that are
compatible with one framework and not the others, and there
is no longer a notion of a self-contained component that only
relies on standardized APIs. IMHO adding a getter, or making
the history state into a key-value store, is a cheap price to
pay API-wise to get self-contained components without any
strings attached.

This is because you mixed up the sequence of replies, it is
about *leaving* history entry below:

Text from above: &quot;My point is that this is not always practical, 
imagine f ex serializing a large tree or rich-text editor on every 
update event.&quot;
Performance is key here; if you will be storing state that takes
a performance hit to prepare for storage, then you don't want to
save it on every user keystroke or similar, you want to know when
it is time to save and do it once.

Compare f ex with step 4 in History Traversal:
|<i> update the current entry in the browsing context's Document 
</I>|<i> object's History object to reflect any state that the user agent 
</I>|<i> wishes to persist. [...] For example, some user agents might want 
</I>|<i> to persist the scroll position, or the values of form controls.
</I>
Ie, this data is persisted on demand at a certain point in the
history entry's life cycle, just as I am suggesting for the 
pushState state.
With the same reasoning as for current pushState, the spec would
instead suggest that scroll position and form control values were
persisted immediately when changed, instead of at the &quot;leave
history entry&quot; event.
