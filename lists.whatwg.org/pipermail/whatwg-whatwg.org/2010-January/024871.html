I've tried to spec this. There is a high risk of compatibility issues, so 
I would very much welcome feedback from implementors who try to implement 
this.

The main goal of the change here is to make it possible to implement this 
(if not completely sanely, but it's the Web, there's only so much I can 
do) in a situation with each browsing context having its own process, as 
seen to some extent in IE and Chrome, and as is being examined by other 
browser vendors also.


While I was at it I made 'hashchange' and 'popstate' fire completely 
async, and gave 'hashchange' context information to get around the problem 
with it firing async (where it could e.g. fire twice for the same URL, 
because the navigations get processed before it fires).

</I>
Per spec now, any code along the lines of:

   history.back();
   location.hash = &quot;foo&quot;;

...will cause the back() to be a no-op. This is definitely incompatible 
with legacy implementations; the question is whether there are pages 
depending on it.

If we can't do this asynchronously, it's going to really suck for 
multiprocess UAs, so I think it's worth trying to find a solution here, 
even if there is a back-compat risk. In practice I don't think the risk 
is as high as it could be, because interop is pretty poor in this area 
already; in particular, Chrome does things that are quite drastic when 
given code like the above, and Chrome developers aren't aware of having 
received bugs about it.

Again, please send feedback on this. The diff is:
