As said in the whatwg wiki &quot;The point to all this is that you shouldn&#8217;t 
place too much weight on the status of the specification as a whole. You 
need to consider the stability and maturity level of each section 
individually. &quot;.
However, I think I understand the underlying idea which is that if we 
keep adding things, the HTML5 spec will never reach the recommendation 
status (even for 2022).
The &lt;device&gt; element offers a very interesting potential. However, I 
have the impression that it will require years of work before having a 
first good &quot;working draft&quot; because of diversity of devices sorts and 
even devices serving the same purpose.
In my humble opinion, it would be wiser if the device element had its 
own separate specification and wasn't lost within an already almost one 
million pixels height spec.

While reading the whatwg wiki section &quot;When will HTML5 be finished? &quot;, I 
realized that it is currently hard for web authors to answer the 
question &quot;what sections of the spec are at the 'Implemented and widely 
deployed' status ?&quot;
It might be a good idea for communication around the HTML5 spec to keep 
an updated list of sections and subsections sorted by level of maturity. 
Another (complementary ?) idea would be to provide this information in 
the table of content by putting titles of sections/subsections in 
different colors (and/or background color). It would be a good way for 
people who are discovering HTML5 to understand what they are somehow 
&quot;allowed&quot; to use today.

Thanks,

David
