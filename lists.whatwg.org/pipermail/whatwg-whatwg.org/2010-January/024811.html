That's fair, and I completely agree in principle.

The reality of the situation of course is that implementation challenges
matter a lot.  If implementation costs are high and the benefits of
modifying the code are relatively low, then we are likely to end up with
browsers having inconsistent behavior for some time.



&gt;<i> You are correct that consistency is good. However, whether a navigation to
</I>&gt;<i> a different document is asynchronous can barely be observed - it's not like
</I>&gt;<i> any code from the current document will run after the navigation anyway. For
</I>&gt;<i> within-document navigations, I could imagine synchronous behavior might make
</I>&gt;<i> some things easier to code - you could call history.back() to pop the state
</I>&gt;<i> stack, and your code running afterwards could assume you'd successfully
</I>&gt;<i> traversed to the new state. On the other hand, I could also imagine it's
</I>&gt;<i> harder. And history.back is probably not used all that much in modern Web
</I>&gt;<i> apps anyway. That's why I don't have a very good picture of which approach
</I>&gt;<i> is better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Isn't this what popstate and hashchange notifications are for?  Afterall,
the user could also press the back button, and the developer would probably
be concerned with that case too.
