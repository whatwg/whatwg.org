&lt;span sandbox&gt;$something&lt;/sandbox&gt; was meant to be more or less the
same as &lt;iframe sandbox srcdoc=&quot;$something&quot;&gt;.  The latter achieves the
same effect but is cleaner and makes more sense.  I must not have
known about the doc=&quot;&quot; proposal at that point, but I can't remember
what I was thinking more than a month ago.

DNS prefetching doesn't tell you anything except that someone viewed
the link, right?  And maybe what their ISP is, in a typical case.
Including an image tells you their IP address, User-Agent, and so on.

How can you get any data out of a link with no DNS prefetching?  Some
users will click the link, but not all.  Maybe quite a lot if you
allow arbitrary CSS, of course . . . you could easily make the whole
post a link.  But &quot;everyone who clicks on a given post for some
reason&quot; is still a lot less than &quot;all viewers&quot;, which is what image
inclusions will do.
