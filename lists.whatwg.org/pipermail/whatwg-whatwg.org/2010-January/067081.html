<PRE>My 2c (as of talking to myself trying to figure out how to do a prototype of
this)...

I'm not sure where such service would belong, but it would suffer the same
problem that early VoIP systems suffered behind a firewall... While one
would be able to open a socket and serve data, there would have to be some
kind of uPnP or NAT integration to make it visible to the web (or a
tunneling solution as those old http-tunnel stuff).

Apart from that, I think it would be something like embedding a webserver
(or better yet embedding node.js [<A HREF="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</A>]) in the same level as
the javascript API is implemented and allow pure or pre-arranged sockets to
be open.

AFAIK, using websockets, the browser initiates a connection with the server,
which will proceed upgrading the connection type and opening a two way
communication with the server and from now on the application defines the
line protocol. At least is what I gathered when doing this:
<A HREF="http://github.com/gleicon/txwebsockets">http://github.com/gleicon/txwebsockets</A>

That way, apart from the browser doing this 2-way connection, it could open
a standard tcp socket, or better, a kind of special server and register
itself on a DHT or tracker (that I think would need to be an obligatory
step).

The p2p like mesh network is a great idea, but I think it would take some
security heads thinking around on what socket/server models it would be safe
to let a browser start, a framework for the tracker registering and a
sandbox akin to crossdomain.xml to protect it from turning to a giant
botnet.

I think this kind of thinking would be great with w3c behind it (and a wide
open discussion on security issues), as I think the node.js approach could
be &quot;quicker&quot; to implement browser-wise...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As your Google friend noted, I'm wondering why you'd want to implement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this on the HTML5 level, not on the browser (C++) level. Implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; such a protocol within the browser would probably be faster, more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; secure and a better design choice since the functionality is basically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the same for every web application. I'm guessing the reason is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you do not want to achieve this by changing/extending the browser but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rather by using new HTML5 technologies instead. Am I right?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While I realize that this is best implemented at the browser level, my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concern is if it will be an idea that would be broadly adopted by all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser vendors if it is implemented at that level. It's an idea that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really has value once you've reached critical mass. For example, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be an extremely potent idea if the two most popular browsers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have implemented this by 2014 to 2015 or so. HTML5 is a web technology
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec. I imagine that putting it in the spec would greatly increase the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chances of browsers supporting this functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I am not familiar with the politics that govern whether or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not browser product managers implement these features at the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Being pragmatic, do you think it's possible to get widespread adoption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quickly for a feature like this as the browser level or do you agree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that this would be more likely to be adopted quickly if it was part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a W3C spec?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there are two separate issues here. First, if this idea is to
</I>&gt;<i> be widely adopted and implemented - I believe there must be an open
</I>&gt;<i> specification of it. And there are basically two ways of doing this -
</I>&gt;<i> by having it proposed by a specific browser vendor or by having it
</I>&gt;<i> proposed by a standardization organisation like the W3C or IETF. And
</I>&gt;<i> yes, you're right - having something proposed by W3C versus a specific
</I>&gt;<i> browser vendor - I'd say it's more likely to catch on if the W3C puts
</I>&gt;<i> it foot behind it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, there is a difference between a) implementing the idea in the
</I>&gt;<i> browser engine versus b) implementing it as a part of the application
</I>&gt;<i> executing on the browser engine. The same functionality can be
</I>&gt;<i> achieved by defining a protocol which browsers would implement as a
</I>&gt;<i> part their engine (e.g. using some other available protocol instead of
</I>&gt;<i> WebSockets (e.g. plan old HTTP or SPDY) and threads instead of
</I>&gt;<i> WebWorkers) or by creating web applications where each application
</I>&gt;<i> would implement this protocol itself using application level
</I>&gt;<i> technologies (i.e. the proposed WebSockets and WebWorkers tech). In
</I>&gt;<i> essence, it doesn't matter which technology you use to implement it as
</I>&gt;<i> long as it implements the protocol you define. So, since technologies
</I>&gt;<i> used for implementation are open and available, why would the W3C
</I>&gt;<i> wan't this implemented at the application level versus the browser
</I>&gt;<i> level? Both scenarios require changes to both the server of an
</I>&gt;<i> application and the browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If so, then a major problem is that the browser is not a network
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; server, rather only a client. In order for a browser A to connect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; using WebSockets to a browser B which executes some process, browser B
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; must expose a network accessible end-point to which that process is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; tied i.e. the browser must expose TCP/IP end-point. I guess that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; NAT traversal problem Melvin mentioned basically covers this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Assuming that this idea really only sees adoption within a few years,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't IPv6 resolve the issue of NAT traversal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with NAT traversal or what other novelties IPv6
</I>&gt;<i> introduces other than a broader address space, so I may be wrong when
</I>&gt;<i> saying this but - only by switching from IPv4 to IPv6 will not solve
</I>&gt;<i> this problem. The browser would still be a client initiating
</I>&gt;<i> connections to other network entities, not a server accepting
</I>&gt;<i> connections from those clients. Or as Mike put it: &quot;WebSockets doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> let you open arbitrary ports and listen on them&quot;. I'm not getting into
</I>&gt;<i> how hard this is to do, I'm just saying that it's something which is
</I>&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In a broader context of connecting both servers and client devices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; into a large network for scalable execution of applications, your idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reminds me of a recent blog article I read:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/12/16/building-super-scalable-systems-blade-runner-meets-autonomic.html">http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/12/16/building-super-scalable-systems-blade-runner-meets-autonomic.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Definitely have a look at it - it's a bit on the visionary side and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; longish, but worth it. I believe a planet-wide execution platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; consisting of every network device will eventually happen and that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; why I think we should all be contributing in that direction, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; your idea definitely is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I took a brief look. This article looks very interesting. I'm going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a gander at it tomorrow. Maybe I'll shoot the HighScalability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people an email and see if they want to comment on this idea on their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blog.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe Todd from HighScalability will like the idea. It's a
</I>&gt;<i> direction in which lots of people see the Internet/WWW going. I hope
</I>&gt;<i> you didn't get me wrong with my comments - I like your idea of
</I>&gt;<i> distributing the load towards clients.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Ivan
