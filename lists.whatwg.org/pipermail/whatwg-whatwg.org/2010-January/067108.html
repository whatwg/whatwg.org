<PRE>&gt;<i> I've introduced srcdoc=&quot;&quot; to largely handle this. There is an example in
</I>&gt;<i> the spec showing how it can be used.
</I>
Yup, sounds good.

&gt;<i> This has been proposed before. The concern is that many authors would be
</I>&gt;<i> likely to make mistakes in their selection of &quot;random&quot; tokens that would
</I>&gt;<i> lead to significant flaws in the deployment of the feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> srcdoc=&quot;&quot; is less prone to errors. Only &quot; and &amp; characters need to be
</I>&gt;<i> escaped. If the &quot; character is not escaped, then a single &quot; character in
</I>&gt;<i> the input will cause the comment to break.
</I>
My counterargument, as stated later in the thread, is quite simple:
the former *forces* you to implement a security mechanism, else the
functionality will break. You can still use a bad token, but you are
required to make the effort.

In that regard, the comparison to XSRF is probably not valid; a vast
majority of XSRF bugs occurs not because people pick poor tokens (in
fact, that's really a majority), but because they don't use them at
all. From that perspectiv, srcdoc=&quot;...&quot; is very similar to XSRF -
people will mess it up simply by not thinking about the correct
escaping.

That said, I am not really arguing against srcdoc=&quot;...&quot;; I think it's
an OK feature. My point is simply that I would love to see less
fragmentation when it comes to XSS defenses and the granularity of
security controls. The initial proposal of &lt;iframe&gt; sandboxes solved a
very narrow use case, and other, unrelated designs started to spring
up elsewhere. This wouldn't be bad by itself, but while the security
controls on &lt;iframes&gt; were pretty great (with some tweaks, such as
text/html-sandboxed), they would not be reflected in other APIs, which
I thought is unfortunate.

If we extend sandboxed iframes with srcdoc, seamless frames,
text/html-sandboxed, and &lt;iframe&gt; rendering performance improvements,
it actually becomes close to a comprehensive solution, and I am happy
with this (other than a vague feeling that we just repurposed &lt;iframe&gt;
to be some sort of a &lt;span&gt; ;-).

&gt;<i> I've introduced text/html-sandboxed for this purpose.
</I>
Yup, I noticed. Looks great. It does make me wonder about two things, though:

1) Some other security mechanisms (CORS, anti-clickjacking controls,
XSS filter controls) rely on separate HTTP headers instead. Is there a
compelling reason not to follow that lead - or better yet, to unify
all security headers to conserve space?

2) People may conceivably want to sandbox other document types (e.g.,
SVG, RSS, or other XML-based formats rendered natively, and offering
scripting capabilities). Do we want to create &quot;-sandboxed&quot; MIME types
for each? The header approach would fix this, too.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2.1) The ability to disable loading of external resources (images,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts, etc) in the sandboxed document. The common usage scenario is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you do not want the displayed document to &quot;phone home&quot; for privacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons, for example in a web mail system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good point. Should we make sandbox=&quot;&quot; disable off-origin network requests?
</I>
That would be great. I think Adam proposed we have a separate
sandbox=&quot;...&quot; toggle for this. Whether it's on or off by default
probably doesn't matter much.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2.2) The ability to disable HTML parsing. On IFRAMEs, this can actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be approximated with the excommunicated &lt;plaintext&gt; tag, or with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Content-Type: text/plain / data:text/plain,. On token-guarded SPANs or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DIVs, however, it would be pretty damn useful for displaying text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content without the need to escape &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, etc. &quot;Pure&quot; security benefit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is limited, but as a phishing prevention and display correctness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measure, it makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really understand the use case here; could you elaborate?
</I>
One use case is a web forum or a web mail interface where you want to
display a message, but specifically don't want HTML formatting. Or,
performance permitting, the same could be used for any text-only entry
fields displayed on a page. These are common XSS vectors, and they are
not readily addressed by sandboxed &lt;iframe&gt; + srcdoc=&quot;...&quot;, because
this will not render as expected:

User's favorite smiley face is: &lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&lt;O&gt;_&lt;O&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Having a drop-in solution for this would be pretty nice, and very easy
to implement, too: just force text/plain, do not sniff.

&gt;<i> Do people get CSRF right more often than simply escaping characters? It
</I>&gt;<i> seems implausible that authors get complex cryptographic properties right
</I>&gt;<i> more often than a simple set of substitutions, but I suppose stranger
</I>&gt;<i> things are true on the Web.
</I>
Keep in mind that pretty much every web application already needs to
safely generate unique, unpredictable tokens - for session identifiers
that guard authenticated sessions. If they can't get it right, they
are hosed anyway - but problems here are not horribly common, in my
experience at least, and web app frameworks do a decent job of helping
developers by providing token-generating facilities.

As noted earlier, the vast majority of issues with XSS and XSRF
defenses is that you explicitly need to think about them, and a
failure to do so has no obvious side effects. From that perspective,
any solution that requires a security mechanism to be used is far
better.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, a single token on a returned page, as long as it's unpredictable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> across user sessions, should not be a significant issue.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just worried that some people would just a constant string.
</I>
Sure; but there's a difference between the near certainty of
forgetting to escape something, somewhere, in a complex web app (in
fact, I did so on several occasions in my code, despite making a
living by pointing these issues to others on a daily basis) - and
willingly sabotaging your app. Browser vendors / standards bodies are
partly at fault for the former, but have no obligation to prevent the
latter.

&gt;&gt;<i> I was merely suggesting that we *expand* the same logic, and the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> excellent security control granularity, to span and div; this seems like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would not increase the implementation complexity in any significant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the proposal then. What is the problem it is solving,
</I>&gt;<i> and how does it solve it?
</I>
It makes it possible to conveniently sandbox small, inline snippets of
user input on HTML pages, without a significant performance penalty.
As noted, if &lt;iframe&gt; rendering speed is improved instead, and srcdoc
and seamless rendering is implemented, the two proposals become
roughly equivalent, though (spare for the argument over srcdoc=&quot;...&quot;
versus guard tokens). It does feel a bit odd to turn an &lt;iframe&gt; into
something that looks like &lt;span&gt;, swims like &lt;span&gt;, and quacks like
&lt;span&gt; - but that's mostly an aesthetic objection that shouldn't
matter much (a labored argument could be made that it will not be
obvious you can and should use &lt;iframe&gt; this way, so some people may
not fully utilize the security benefits it offers - but...)

&gt;<i> I don't understand what you mean by &quot;does not enforce a security control&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> or how a guarded closing tag does &quot;enforce a security control&quot;.
</I>
If you have the intent to display user-controlled input, you have three options:

&lt;span&gt;[server-sanitized string]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;[server-escaped string]&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;span guard=[token]&gt;[any string]&lt;/span guard=[token]&gt;

The first two options will not immediately fail if you forget about or
mess up escaping or sanitization - and people to, all the time. The
last option just works, unless you purposefully sabotage your code by
using &quot;1234&quot;, or can't generate a random number / session token on
server side (in which case, you are hosed already - session cookies
can be guessed, too). The last option strikes me as a bit less
error-prone.
