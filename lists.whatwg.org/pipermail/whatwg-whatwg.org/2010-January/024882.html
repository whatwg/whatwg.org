I have seen some arguments why it is perhaps  hard to implement, but
not possible at all?

</I>

How should UA handle this case? User presses back (which hopefully
does pretty much the same as history.back()) but web page has some
loop like script which sets location.hash all the time.
Depending on the script state, back might not succeed?
Or does location.hash = &quot;foo&quot;; not clear the history tasks if
back()/forward() was caused by the UA/user.

I know there is &quot;When the user navigates through a browsing context, 
e.g. using a browser's back and forward buttons, the user agent must 
traverse the history by a delta equivalent to the action specified by 
the user.&quot; but that doesn't quite clarify the situation, I think.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we can't do this asynchronously, it's going to really suck for
</I>&gt;<i> multiprocess UAs,
</I>Depends for example on whether UA wants to put different domains in
same tab to different processes. And even if it does do, synchronous
back()/forward() should be possible. Maybe just not as easy.
So I'm not sure that &quot;suck for multiprocess UAs&quot; is a really good
argument here.


  so I think it's worth trying to find a solution here,
&gt;<i> even if there is a back-compat risk. In practice I don't think the risk
</I>&gt;<i> is as high as it could be, because interop is pretty poor in this area
</I>&gt;<i> already; in particular, Chrome does things that are quite drastic when
</I>&gt;<i> given code like the above, and Chrome developers aren't aware of having

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, please send feedback on this. The diff is:

Uh, changing hashchange again to async. We must stop changing that all 
the time. Though in this case I like the change. I never really
understood the sync hashchange, or the reasoning why it was changed to 
be sync.


So history.back(); history.back(); would queue 2 tasks?
And first one document is loaded (maybe from bfcache), and it could
synchronously do something like dispatch pageshow or whatever which
could do things like alert() and then second document was loaded at 
somepoint. Kind of strange way to handle history.back().
