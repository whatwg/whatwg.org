<PRE>Back around Oct 15, Ian summarized his objections to letting &lt;cite&gt;
refer to the primary source of the information, rather than being an
oddly named synoymy for &lt;i class=title&gt;.

&gt;&gt;<i> Similarly, you are welcome to say that the academic habit of crediting

</I>
...
&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; -- particularly when restyled to not be visually apparent -- may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be one of the few aspects of HTML which is more important to other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> classes of products.
</I>
&gt;<i> Like what? Are there examples I could look at? That would be very helpful
</I>&gt;<i> in terms of finding purposes for &lt;cite&gt; other than just italics.
</I>
I was thinking of business-rule-validators that ensure claims are
&quot;justified&quot;, or academic-influence measures that track citation
graphs.

That said, I suspect any tool that can assume cooperative authors will
be custom, and could therefore be written to look for &lt;span
class=&quot;citetool-pay-attention&quot;&gt;.  So this use case may be about cruft
rather than needs.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is there as much semantic value in pointing to the primary source of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; statement as there is in knowing that the word &quot;earth&quot; refers to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; planet and not the dirt, for example? If so, what is that extra value?
</I>
When quotes are attributed to Winston Churchill (or Oscar Wilde), that
attribution is important -- generally more important than which
specific speech it came from.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dialogues and transcripts and credits and theatrical scripts are all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; arguably too fine-grained for a &quot;citation&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;label&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or &quot;attribution&quot;, but they are certainly real use cases where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; attribution is important.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Why? This is not a rhetorical question, I'm trying to get to the use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; case that means that there is an actual benefit to what you are asking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> They are all cases where &quot;who said it&quot; or &quot;who did it&quot; is important --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes far more important than what they actually said or did.
</I>
&gt;<i> Sure, but &lt;cite&gt; doesn't help determine that. English helps determine
</I>&gt;<i> that. (Or whatever natural language is used.) What is &lt;cite&gt; doing?
</I>
    Evil Lawyer:  So, when did you stop beating your wife?
    Defendant:  Never!

&quot;Evil Lawyer&quot; and &quot;Defendant&quot; aren't pronounced.  Their meanings (and
silence) are deduced from English conventions about punctuation.  I
would prefer a semantic tag.  (I'll freely agree that &lt;cite&gt; isn't the
perfect name, but it seems bizarre to forbid this related meaning,
while allowing generic Title Of Work.)

&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt; and &lt;q&gt; are both useful because of their default styling, as is
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt;, when used for something that works with its default styling. But
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't apply to people's names -- they are almost never made
</I>&gt;<i> italics.
</I>
I actually have read scripts that used italics to indicate the
speaker's name.  I didn't find them the most readable of scripts, but
I have seen them.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'll agree that it seems odd to have that many &lt;cite&gt; elements in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; such close proximity, but it is the closest match I can find in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; spec, and it doesn't seem to be actually wrong. ?Searching for lines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; by a particular character is a fairly common use case.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Doesn't &quot;find in page&quot; handle that fine?
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Not in my opinion.
</I>
&gt;<i> What are you expecting Web browsers to do that would make &lt;cite&gt; a better
</I>&gt;<i> solution? Has a browser vendor expressed an interest in some UI feature
</I>&gt;<i> for searching by citation name or some such?
</I>
Initially, nothing except Javascript or CSS hacks.

I'm expecting those to do something like increase the font size or
change the background for lines *I* have to memorize for *my*
character, or for cue lines that I have to recognize.


&gt;&gt;<i> Because we don't have an &lt;attrib&gt; or even a &lt;credit&gt; element, and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; is the closest match.
</I>
&gt;<i> You're still not saying why you want this element. What would &lt;attrib&gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> good for? What UI would it trigger? How would users or authors benefit?
</I>

I wouldn't expect the main use to be in normal browsing.

I would expect it to be used in License checkers that some
organizations would deploy to ensure they aren't violating copyright.
I would expect it to be used by some scrapers looking for stock
photos.  I would expect it to be used with custom CSS for some users,
who are really looking for a model or photographer rather than an
existing photograph.

&gt;&gt;<i> Defining it as a synonym for &lt;i class=&quot;title&quot;&gt; seems wrong in both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directions -- both promoting something that shouldn't be an element,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *and* preventing sensible use of an appropriately named element.
</I>
&gt;<i> Why would it be wrong to have an element to style titles?
</I>
Turning around your favorite question, what is the semantic value?

I can recommend Orson Scott Card's novel Enchantment.
I can recommend Orson Scott Card's novel &quot;Enchantment&quot;.
I can recommend Orson Scott Card's novel &lt;i class=title&gt;Enchantment&lt;/i&gt;.
I can recommend Orson Scott Card's novel &lt;cite&gt;Enchantment&lt;/cite&gt;.

Is the extra value of the 4th spelling really that great?

And if the semantics are being changed anyhow, why not just move the
entire element from the &quot;valid markup&quot; section to the &quot;user agents
must process&quot; section?
