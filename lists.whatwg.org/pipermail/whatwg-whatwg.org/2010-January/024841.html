Sorry I'm late to this discussion. Would like to add my objection to
using attribute string escaping as a security &quot;feature&quot; in any way. I
strongly prefer required nonces attached to opening and closing of
sections.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Renderers suck dealing with IFRAMEs, and will probably continue to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do so for time being. This means that a typical, moderately complex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application (say, as a discussion forum or a social site), where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hundreds of user-controlled strings may need to be present to display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user content - the mechanism would have an unacceptable load time and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory footprint. In fact, people are already coming up with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightweight alternatives with a significant functionality overlap (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different security controls). Microsoft has toStaticHTML(), while a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standardized implementation is being discussed here right now in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that we should investigate other options too (&lt;iframe&gt; boxes
</I>&gt;<i> aren't suitable for everything), but I don't think that current
</I>&gt;<i> implementation problems with &lt;iframe&gt; should necessarily prevent us from
</I>&gt;<i> investigating sandboxed iframes too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In certain contexts, e.g. reddit comments, it may be the case that instead
</I>&gt;<i> of one sandboxed &lt;iframe&gt; per comment, the best way to do things is
</I>&gt;<i> instead one sandboxed iframe for all the comments, with scripts disabled
</I>&gt;<i> and allow-same-origin enabled, so that scripts can poke into the page and
</I>&gt;<i> set event handlers on all the relevant links.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't the benefit of keeping the design slightly simpler (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realistically, limited to relatively few usage scenarios) negated by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact that alternative solutions to other narrow problems would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emerge elsewhere? The browser coming with several different script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sanitizers with completely different APIs and security controls does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strike me as a desirable outcome (all the flavors of SOP are a testament
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to this). If the anser is not a strong &quot;no&quot;, maybe the token-guarded DIV
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> / SPAN approach is a better alternative?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree in principle that fewer features are better than more features,
</I>&gt;<i> but we have to take into account that many of the people deploying these
</I>&gt;<i> features know nothing about security. We have to ensure that the security
</I>&gt;<i> aspects of features like this (like what to escape, what security tokens
</I>&gt;<i> need to be generated) are aligned with the practical aspects of features
</I>&gt;<i> like this (like what results in the page appearing to work, regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> the state of security).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, that aside - on a more pragmatic level, I have two extra comments:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) The utility of the SOP sandboxing behavior outlined in the spec is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> diminished if we have no way to actually *enforce* that the IFRAMEd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource would only be rendered in such a context. If I am serving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user-supplied, unsanitized HTML, it is obviously safe to do &lt;iframe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sandbox src=&quot;show.cgi?id=1234&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; - but where do we prevent the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacker from calling <A HREF="http://my_site/show.cgi?id=1234">http://my_site/show.cgi?id=1234</A> directly, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bypassing the filter?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've introduced text/html-sandboxed for this purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.1) The ability to disable loading of external resources (images,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts, etc) in the sandboxed document. The common usage scenario is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you do not want the displayed document to &quot;phone home&quot; for privacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons, for example in a web mail system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good point. Should we make sandbox=&quot;&quot; disable off-origin network requests?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.2) The ability to disable HTML parsing. On IFRAMEs, this can actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be approximated with the excommunicated &lt;plaintext&gt; tag, or with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Content-Type: text/plain / data:text/plain,. On token-guarded SPANs or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DIVs, however, it would be pretty damn useful for displaying text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content without the need to escape &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, etc. &quot;Pure&quot; security benefit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is limited, but as a phishing prevention and display correctness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measure, it makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really understand the use case here; could you elaborate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Sun, 13 Dec 2009, Michal Zalewski replied to Tab:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I believe that the @doc attribute, discussed in the original threads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; about @sandbox, will be introduced to deal with that. &#160;It'll take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; plain html as a string, avoiding the opaqueness and larger escaping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; requirements of a <A HREF="data://">data://</A> url, as the only thing you'll have to escape
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is whichever quote you're using to surround the value.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That doesn't strike me as a robust way to prevent XSS - the primary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason why we need sandboxing to begin with is that people have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficulty properly parsing, serializing, or escaping HTML; so replacing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this with a mechanism that still requires escaping is perhaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suboptimal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a world of difference between &quot;properly parsing, serializing, or
</I>&gt;<i> escaping HTML&quot; and &quot;escaping quotes and ampersands&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;More importantly, though, it puts a significant burden on authors to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; generate unpredictable tokens. &#160;Is this difficult? &#160;No, of course not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But people *will* do it badly, copypasting a single token in all their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;iframe&gt;s or similar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People already need to do this well for XSRF defenses to work, and I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wager it's a much simpler and better-defined problem than real-world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML parsing and escaping could realistically be. It is also very easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to delegate this task to existing functions in common web frameworks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do people get CSRF right more often than simply escaping characters? It
</I>&gt;<i> seems implausible that authors get complex cryptographic properties right
</I>&gt;<i> more often than a simple set of substitutions, but I suppose stranger
</I>&gt;<i> things are true on the Web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, a single token on a returned page, as long as it's unpredictable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> across user sessions, should not be a significant issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just worried that some people would just a constant string.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; That seems like a backwards way of proceeding. &#160;Do you have a proposal

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only fundamental objection I have heard against it is the trouble

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it also doesn't really solve all the problems. For example, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't solve the &quot;embedding external content safely&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The other option is to simply require a traditional CDATA-esque behavior
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or a tag parameter - which would place the burden on the author to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filter out / escape a single exact string or a quote, but would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's similar to what srcdoc=&quot;&quot; does when used with sandbox=&quot;&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's obviously less secure - because while the token-based approach
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually requires the user to explicitly come up with a token, however
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poor it might be; whereas here, there is no way to enforce escaping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The token-based approach could lead an author to just coming up with a
</I>&gt;<i> constant token, which is just as useless as not enforcing escaping, except
</I>&gt;<i> that the author had to wonder how to get security to use it, and thus the
</I>&gt;<i> author will have a false sense of security whose only likely failure mode
</I>&gt;<i> is an actual attack. Compare this to srcdoc=&quot;&quot;, where the failure mode is
</I>&gt;<i> the use of a quote mark, and is thus likely to happen much earlier than an
</I>&gt;<i> attack. It's also easier to understand the failure mode. &quot;The token has to
</I>&gt;<i> be unguessable&quot; is harder to explain than &quot;quotes have to be escaped&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From Tab's response, looks like it's being considered, too - @doc +
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> @seamless. What's strikes me as a bit ironic is that this way, we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overloading IFRAME to become something else entirely, and after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rejecting token-guards, settling for an option that is definitely not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perfect, and in practice, I think, is bound to be less secure.
