My debate with Darin has so far primarily been about how one reads the spec, and this is most certainly how I've read it.

&gt;<i> &lt;long rant about why state objects should survive document unload, and that state objects are pointless if they don't&gt;
</I>
I think you're totally right.  As I've been discussing the spec with Darin in email and the webkit.org bug I've basically come to the same conclusion.

That said...

&gt;<i> Where the spec needs to be clarified to support this, I think it
</I>&gt;<i> should be.  But let's first agree that this is the right thing to do.
</I>
The discussion between Darin and I was about my interpretation of the spec, what I implemented based on that interpretation, and how his interpretation was different.  

I think we're now in agreement on what it *should* be, I think the spec should be explicit about it, and I think the ambiguity between &quot;state,&quot; &quot;state object,&quot;, and &quot;persisted user state&quot; is what might've led us all to misread the other's positions. 

&quot;Entry with persisted user state&quot; is already used quite explicitly in two places, but needs application in key place at the end of 6.11.1.

2 - If the navigation was initiated for entry update of an entry:
	1 - Replace the entry being updated with a new entry representing the new resource and its Document object and related state. The user agent may propagate state from the old entry to the new entry (e.g. scroll position).

might read:

2 - If the navigation was initiated for entry update of an entry:
	1 - Replace the entry being updated with a new entry representing the new resource and its Document object.  If the entry being updated is a state object entry the user agent must propagate the state object to the new entry.  The user agent may propagate persisted user state from the old entry to the new entry (e.g. scroll position).

Thoughts?

PS:  On a related note...

&gt;<i> If I'm understanding the bug correctly, Brady is suggesting not that a
</I>&gt;<i> popstate event isn't fired when we navigate back to a document which
</I>&gt;<i> has been unloaded from memory, but that the state object in that
</I>&gt;<i> popstate event is null.
</I>
My argument was actually indeed, that the event is not fired at all.  But as I hit up the spec to present my reasoning why, I discovered that 6.11.9 step 10 basically says that popstate events are fired for *ANY* history traversal except for fragment scrolls between non-state-object entries.

So my argument shifts to what you say - the state object in that event is null.  This was just sloppy reading on my part.

That we don't currently fire the popstate event in such cases is a WebKit bug that I have filed as <A HREF="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33571">https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33571</A>
