It doesn't seem useful to hit that element. It's not the (SVG) document 
title, after all.

I ended up going with:

 - if it's an SVG document, use the first <title> child of the root 
   element

 - if it's an HTML document, use the first <title> element in tree order
   (that's what it used to be)

For setting it uses the same element, unless there isn't one, in which 
case:

 - if it's an SVG document, append an SVG <title> to the root element

 - if it's an HTML document, append a <title> to the <head>

Hopefully that's compatible enough. Let me know if you need something 
different.

This seems to not quite match the SVG semantics, unfortunately.

You can certainly imagine a compound document format containing entire 
HTML subdocuments, <html>, <head>, <title>, and all. I'm not sure that's 
possible with just SVG and HTML currently though. (Maybe MathML, indeed.)

As a general rule I would recommend against using Accept headers to do 
anything. You're better off making the JSON data its own resource, IMHO.

Having said that, as you noted in a later e-mail, the MIME type suggested 
by the HTML spec is "application/microdata+json".

There's not any way currently to make for controls map to microdata. It's 
not clear exactly what it would mean.

Does it break existing content? If not, why not ask the SVG spec to be
changed? The thread was started by one of the SVG spec editors after
all.

Dirk and heycam's replies to your original e-mail here suggest that this 
is not really viable. I mean, it'd be like changing document.title in 
HTML to point to the first title="" attribute in the document if it came 
before the first <title>.

Anyway, what the spec ended up saying is in some ways even simpler, since 
it only looks one level deep for SVG rather than doing a deep tree search.

(Is this the kind of change that you would have liked pre-flighted? I can 
revert the change and put out an announcement if you like. I'm not yet 
sure I exactly understand what kinds of changes fall into this category.)
