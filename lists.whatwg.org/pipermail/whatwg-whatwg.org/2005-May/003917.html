The canonical approach is making one form that encloses everything on 
the page. That way, you can sprinkle submit buttons wherever you like.

If there are noticeable side effects (ie. something written in a log on 
the server does not count), GET is inappropriate.

I don't think it follows that POST links are needed but that submit 
buttons need an alternative appearance that makes them more suitable to 
be packed in a table representing Web mail messages, etc. (I am not 
suggesting that form widgets be arbitrarily stylable. That doesn't work 
nicely with UI themes developed after Windows 3.1. I am suggesting a 
style property like button-type: grid-item; for selecting for a 
predefined list of button styles.)

What you are suggesting degrades to something unsafe. Styling submit 
buttons would degrade to something safe but perhaps ugly.

&gt;<i> I'm just trying to explain why this &quot;incorrect&quot; practice is so common.
</I>
I can think of the following reasons:
1) A very large number of people doing Web stuff are clueless and 
incompetent.
2) Many people haven't gotten in the habit of making page-wide forms.
3) A link is less verbose to type than a submit button.
4) Many people find submit buttons bulky and the buttons cannot be 
universally styled to be less bulky.

I think the last one is a big deal when the graphics deezyner overrides 
RFC 2616. But things that please them belong in CSS.
