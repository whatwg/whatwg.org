OBJECT is not by definition a plug-in, and Opera/Mozilla/Safari/IE all
currently use native renderers to render OBJECT elements, there is no
reason why this should not continue.

&quot;Creating a 3D markup language is somewhat outside the purview of this

</I>
I've never made any comments about plug-ins, OBJECT does not imply
plugin.  The problem though is the very nature of creating javascript
API's to create scenes, rather than a 3D rendering language, if you
choose a 3D declaration language then the canvas API approach is not
appropriate either and a simple &lt;img src=&quot;something.what3D&quot;&gt; (or maybe
object) is the appropriate method of creating a scene.

&lt;canvas3d id=&quot;chicken&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas3d&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/ecmascript&quot;&gt;
var context=document.getElementById('chicken').get3ddrawingcontext();
context.loadExternalModel('something.what3D');
&lt;/script&gt;

Is simply bad, there's no rationale for all that extra indirection,
can I also remind you once again that the WHAT-WG individual has
stated:
&quot;Creating a 3D markup language is somewhat outside the purview of this 
working group, though.&quot;
&lt;URL: <A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/whatwg-whatwg.org@lists.whatwg.org/msg00726.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/whatwg-whatwg.org@lists.whatwg.org/msg00726.html</A>

your explanation of loading these external files, would require you to
create just such a markup language.  This is the problem I have,
without external files of any sort, then a 3D api is pretty useless,
the fact it's been trivial in IE since 1997, yet hasn't been used, I
think makes that clear.

&gt;<i>    If by declarative you mean like X3D, then WHATWG clearly shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> add such markup to HTML because it would duplicate the work of another
</I>&gt;<i> group unnecessarily.
</I>
Just like it's not necessary to embed jpeg's inside HTML documents to
get images in them, it's not necessary to embed 3D markup inside HTML
documents to get 3D images.

&gt;<i>    If I'm reading this right, you're saying that no one uses
</I>&gt;<i> DirectAnimation, and perhaps 3D in general, so why introduce a
</I>&gt;<i> potentially competing standard when there's no real demand for the
</I>&gt;<i> original? 
</I>
I'm asking for you to justify your use cases, for example implement a
mock one in some pseudo code, you will see very rapidly that for any
of them to work they require externally defined 3D models, defining a
3D model language is &quot;somewhat outside the purview of this working
group&quot;. If you discover that you don't, then I will gladly concede
that your use-cases are practical.

As to the DirectAnimation, one of the &quot;fundamental principles&quot; of the
WHAT-WG is &quot;features should be implementable using behaviors,
scripting, and style sheets in IE6 today&quot; the only way to do that with
3D is to use a DirectAnimation layer, because of that, it makes
complete sense to just take the DirectAnimation API as a whole.

Jim.
