I don't really see a case outside the datagrid dragging (which is handled 
elsewhere) where there would be a need to specify an element as draggable or 
as a drag target without scripting in drag behavior. In light of this, I 
don't see any reason to pollute the HTML namespace with more attributes 
(contentDraggable) when this will necessarily be a scripted event anyway. 
Please feel free to point out cases where another HTML attribute would have 
an advantage over a DOM property that could be set directly via script.

As for the dragging event model for a single DOM element, I think the events 
outlined in the current draft of the spec are a good start. In addition, 
however, it would be nice to add some presentational niceties via CSS 
pseudo-classes.

:<i>draggable = DOM element that has .draggable=true (or whatever is decided 
</I>on)
:<i>dragging = DOM element that is being dragged (perhaps opacity: 0.5)
</I>:<i>dragging:droppable = DOM element that is being dragged and can be dropped 
</I>over its current location
:<i>dragtarget / ? = container that allows for the current dragging element to 
</I>be dropped upon it (border: 2px dotted red)
:<i>dragged = the original DOM element that was dragged, in its original 
</I>position (it would be up to script to determine whether or not to remove it 
or whatever else)

I think something along these lines is invaluable to a rich GUI interface.

Drag groups could be specified by a simple NodeList that would be defined at 
dragstart.

e.g.
var elDrag = document.getElementById(&quot;mydragelement&quot;);
var myNodeList = [];
myNodeList.push(document.getElementById(&quot;dragfriend1&quot;));
myNodeList.push(document.getElementById(&quot;dragfriend2&quot;));
// or just as easily: var myNodeList = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;LI&quot;);
elDrag.addEventListener(&quot;dragstart&quot;, function(e) { 
e.dragNodes.appendChildren(myNodeList); return true; }, false);

For the droppable model, it makes sense to have the drag target element 
specify either Elements or NodeLists that are droppable.

e.g.
var elDragTarget = document.getElementById(&quot;mydragtarget&quot;);
elDragTarget.addDroppable(elDrag);
elDragTarget.addDroppable(myNodeList);

Then the question comes about dragging a group of elements to a drag target 
which only has *some* of the dragged elements in its droppable list. Without 
thinking about it too much, I think this could be handled when the elements 
are dropped as such:

elDrag.addEventListener(&quot;dragend&quot;, function(e) {
// go through each dropped element and check if it's droppable on the drag 
target
for (var i=0; i &lt; e.dragNodes.length; i++)
if ( !dragTarget.isDroppable(e.dragNodes[i]) ) alert(&quot;Unabled to drag 
&quot;+e.dragNodes[i].id+&quot; to &quot;+dragTarget.id);
// of course something more graceful than an alert could be done

return true;
}, false);

Anyway, most of it is food for thought.
