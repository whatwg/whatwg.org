I don't see anything wrong with a Web application using custom attributes 
(preferably clearly prefixed or in a custom namespace) to store 
information like this. But I don't see the value in making the attribute 
for such a case standard. It would restrict what you could do with it, for 
one -- say the Web app wanted to store just a number for the help. Or just 
a URI. Or two URIs. Or an IDREF. Or a string. If we had an attribute, we'd 
have to define what it was, thus either blocking innovation, or using up 
an attribute for no good reason.


&gt;<i> [...reasons why the things I listed might work sometimes...]
</I>
Yes, all the things I listed are plausible solutions, that's why I listed 
them. But they're not good _enough_, IMHO.


&gt;<i> I think that a help attribute is useful in the realm of web 
</I>&gt;<i> applications. Applications tend to be more complex than web documents. A 
</I>&gt;<i> good application is sometimes only as good as its help system. Even if 
</I>&gt;<i> UAs make nothing of it, web developers would have a standard attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> to hook their own help systems from.
</I>
I don't see the advantage of having a standard way of doing something 
non-standard. It wouldn't improve interoperability.
