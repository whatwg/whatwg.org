 &gt;
 &gt; Unless someone can come up with a way to make discoverability
 &gt; practical and usable, there is no point us having this feature.

It is not all about user agents. I once had to build a web application
with extensive context sensitive help. The app even recalled common
entries for data fields. To make it work we invented an attribute called
&quot;helpID&quot;. If the &quot;help&quot; attribute were defined we would have used that
instead.

 &gt; Context-sensitive help is well established in modern GUIs, yes. But
 &gt; the mechanisms by which it is made available are not available or
 &gt; discoverable to the end user in a Web scenario.
 &gt;
 &gt; For example:
 &gt;
 &gt; * A cursor doesn't help, since it requires the user to hover over the
 &gt;  element in order to discover there is help needed.
 &gt;

This provides some feedback at least. But Windows apps don't tend to
provide this form of feedback anyway.

 &gt; * A hot key is not useful since there is no way for the user to know
 &gt; when it would work (and since in the overwhelming majority of cases
 &gt; it would do nothing, there is no reason for the user to think to try
 &gt; it).
 &gt;

An application is something that might be used often. People can
discover F1 for themselves. The UA could at least let the user know that
help is available by enabling the &quot;help&quot; point and click icon.

 &gt; * A menu item has the same problem as a hot key.
 &gt;

The help menu could be updated with page specific help items.

 &gt; * An icon that appears next to controls with help is unworkable since
 &gt;  the icons would interfere with the page layout and thus need to be
 &gt; stylable to satisfy authors. (Furthermore, such help is already
 &gt; possible in a backwards-compatible way simply using hyperlinks.)
 &gt;

A web developer might want to indicate that help is available though:

[help]::after {
   content: url(help-icon.png);
}

I think that a help attribute is useful in the realm of web
applications. Applications tend to be more complex than web documents. A
good application is sometimes only as good as its help system. Even if
UAs make nothing of it, web developers would have a standard attribute
to hook their own help systems from.
