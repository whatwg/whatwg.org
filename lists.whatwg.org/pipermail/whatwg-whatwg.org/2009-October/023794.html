17.10.2009, &#1074; 3:20, Ian Hickson &#1085;&#1072;&#1087;&#1080;&#1089;&#1072;&#1083;(&#1072;):

&gt;<i> I'm not really sure what else to say to be honest. Should I just  
</I>&gt;<i> leave it
</I>&gt;<i> at cookies and nothing else? Really I just want to support Basic  
</I>&gt;<i> (and I
</I>&gt;<i> guess Digest) authentication (primarily for over-TLS connections),  
</I>&gt;<i> so that
</I>&gt;<i> sites that use Basic auth, like, say, porn sites, or the W3C, can  
</I>&gt;<i> also use
</I>&gt;<i> it for their Web Socket connections. I could just limit it that way;  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> that work?
</I>
Formally limiting support for Basic auth would be workable, I guess.  
Implementation of Digest authentication is already non-trivial enough  
for me to wish that we don't implement it at first.

Or perhaps authentication should be limited to cookies in v1 indeed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If /code/, interpreted as ASCII, is &quot;401&quot;, then let /mode/ be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> _authenticate_. Otherwise, fail the Web Socket connection and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> abort these steps.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 407 (proxy authenticate) also likely needs to be supported.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Proxies wouldn't work with WebSockets in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you please elaborate? I thought there was a setup that could  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with most deployed HTTPS proxies - one could run WebSockets server on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port 443.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I see what you're saying. Proxy authentication of this nature is
</I>&gt;<i> covered by step 2 of the handshake algorithm, as part of &quot;connect to  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> proxy and ask it to open a TCP/IP connection to the host given by / 
</I>&gt;<i> host/
</I>&gt;<i> and the port given by /port/&quot;. There's even an example showing auth
</I>&gt;<i> headers being sent to the proxy. By the time we get down to parsing  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> response, we're long past the point where we might be authenticating  
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> proxy. Is that a problem?
</I>
Hmm, I actually don't know for sure. Step 2 only covers the case when  
the user agent is configured to use a proxy - but an organization may  
have a transparent proxy intercepting requests. But I do not know if  
such a proxy can practically request authentication by returning a 407  
response (blurring the meaning of &quot;transparent&quot; a bit, but anyway).

&gt;<i> I could add support for 407 here and just say
</I>&gt;<i> that you jump back to step 2 and include the authentication this time,
</I>&gt;<i> would that work?
</I>
If the answer to my above concern is yes, then it should work, as long  
as the text doesn't require double TLS handshake or something like that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some authentication schemes (e.g. NTLM) work on connection basis,  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think that closing the connection right after receiving a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> challenge can work with them.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, that's quite possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this something you plan to correct in the spec?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there much to correct? I don't understand what would need to change
</I>&gt;<i> here. Does NTLM not work with HTTP without pipelining?
</I>
You probably meant HTTP persistent connections here, not pipelining.  
Yes, since NTLM authentication works on connections and not individual  
requests, closing the connection after receiving a challenge will make  
it inoperable, as far as I know.

&gt;<i> Or do you mean that
</I>&gt;<i> you would rather have authentication be a first-class primitive  
</I>&gt;<i> operation
</I>&gt;<i> in Web Socket, instead of relying on the HTTP features? We could do  
</I>&gt;<i> that:
</I>&gt;<i> instead of faking an HTTP communication, we could have a header in the
</I>&gt;<i> handshake that means &quot;after this, the client must send one more  
</I>&gt;<i> handshake
</I>&gt;<i> consisting of an authentication token&quot;, and if the UA fails to send  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> right extra bit, then fail. I think if we did this, we'd want to punt
</I>&gt;<i> until version 2, though.
</I>

Yes, I think that relying on HTTP specs to define authentication to  
Web Sockets takes the &quot;fake HTTP handshake&quot; concept too far.
