<PRE>Edouard,

 &gt;1) Your example with phpMyAdmin (PMA for short) is slightly wrong (and
 &gt;I'm speaking with several years of experience using it): I just did a
 &gt;bit of testing on my PMA 2.11.9.4 installation and bookmarking works
 &gt;fine down to a reasonable degree: of course, I can't bookmark a &quot;row&quot;
 &gt;itself (wouldn't make much sense, as rows can appear and disappear
 &gt;quite often), but I can bookmark most (almost all) of the &quot;screens&quot; of
 &gt;PMA, such as &quot;list of tables in db X&quot;, &quot;insert new row on table Y&quot;,

In a treeview, node=row, detail page=row. It must be possible to block 
bookmarking of individual rows and columns.

 &gt;3) Finally, this may sound a bit too theoretical, but I think it's
 &gt;worth pointing out: your idea of breaking bookmarking and similar
 &gt;features, as described on your last mail, is not an actual
 &gt;requirement: it seems to be your try at addressing the security
 &gt;requirement.

With all due respect, the client decides what the requirements are &amp; 
aren't. This use case includes the requirement that the user be able to 
drop into and out of tree maintenance as if it were a black box. There 
are three main reasons for that: non-tree webnav convenience, 
restriction of node access mechanisms to those implemented by the 
webapp, avoidance of shortcut webnav access to specific rows.

 &gt;Finally, you don't need to bother too much about how the HTML5 spec
 &gt;will impact on browser support for deprecated and non-updated
 &gt;features: it simply won't. It's a matter of offer and demand: as long
 &gt;as there are &lt;frameset&gt; or &lt;font&gt; tags out there, browsers will be
 &gt;able to handle them, regardless of what the spec may say (currently,
 &gt;the spec just tries to make the different UAs agree on how to handle
 &gt;these and worse things).

In discussion of this issue elsewhere, absence of an HTML5 frameset spec 
is being touted as nailing the case for &quot;framesets are evil, get rid of 
them&quot;. Obviously, absence of an HTML5 frameset spec enables that agenda. 
I do need to bother.

Can I take your non-response to &quot;You are not the first to claim that 
tables &amp; iframes can meet this spec ... if it does I ought to have been 
able to find a working instance in the past six years or so, don't you 
think?&quot; as agreement that there are serious reasons for preferring 
framesets to tables &amp; iframes for this problem?

</I>&gt;<i> Still, I think that matters on the server, but how much does it matter
</I>&gt;<i> on the client? How does this affect the requirements for the
</I>&gt;<i> client-side part of the application? Even if it really matters, which
</I>&gt;<i> requirements for the use-case will be derived from this aspect?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (ii) the data it maintains is in the form of a tree, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> I think that was quite covered by the description &quot;displaying
</I>&gt;<i> tree-based content (editable or not)&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (iii) the objects of database maintenance (rows in the database tables which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instantiate the tree) usually should not be bookmarkable for the same reason
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other database webapps (eg phpMyAdmin) do not bookmark database data---a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bookmark belongs to a browser, but a row of database table data belongs not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a browser but to users who may CRUD it, and access to such objects must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be shortcutted. That is, database maintenance in a webapp depends at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least partly on protecting data from some popular web mechanisms. If that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offends HTML purists, or if this use case conflicts with an &quot;original&quot; idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the web, so be it. For this context, HTML is just a device for getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful things done on the web while enforcing the rules of database
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintenance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> There are too many assumptions here, and I think they should be
</I>&gt;<i> addressed separately:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Your example with phpMyAdmin (PMA for short) is slightly wrong (and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm speaking with several years of experience using it): I just did a

</I>&gt;<i> PMA, such as &quot;list of tables in db X&quot;, &quot;insert new row on table Y&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;table Z's view for rows N to M&quot;, and so on. I heavily use these
</I>&gt;<i> features to manage my online databases (for example, I have a shortcut
</I>&gt;<i> to add contents to my main site by inserting the rows with the new
</I>&gt;<i> contents on the DB), so I consider this a quite desirable feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This is quite serious: you seem to be arguing that bookmarking and
</I>&gt;<i> other features should break in order to protect data. This fails in
</I>&gt;<i> both directions:
</I>&gt;<i> a) Breaking bookmarking and other features doesn't really protect the data, and
</I>&gt;<i> b) protecting the data doesn't require any of these features to break.
</I>&gt;<i> Let me go back to the PMA examples: if, after closing session on my
</I>&gt;<i> browser, I reopen the browser and try to reach my &quot;content addition
</I>&gt;<i> bookmark&quot;, the PMA scripts will ask me for my user and password again:
</I>&gt;<i> if I enter them correctly, I'll be in and will be able to go straight
</I>&gt;<i> away into inserting my contents; otherwise I'd simply get an error
</I>&gt;<i> message.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that security and access control is a serious concern,
</I>&gt;<i> but you need to realize that this approach to it is flawed: if you
</I>&gt;<i> want content to be actually protected, then you must make sure, from
</I>&gt;<i> the server scripts, that the content is *never* sent to an
</I>&gt;<i> unauthorized client. If it's sent, then there is no point in trying to
</I>&gt;<i> hide it on the page: a malicious user can reach it from the page
</I>&gt;<i> source, and (depending on how your application is designed) may even
</I>&gt;<i> be able to trigger an update.
</I>&gt;<i> You may think of it this way: on the client side, the client has the
</I>&gt;<i> power to override anything you try (view source, grease-monkey
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, customized browsers... there are plenty of ways): the client
</I>&gt;<i> has control over what runs on the client's machine. It's only on the
</I>&gt;<i> server side where you have full control; and thus anything that relies
</I>&gt;<i> on such control (such as managing permissions) should be handled
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Finally, this may sound a bit too theoretical, but I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> worth pointing out: your idea of breaking bookmarking and similar
</I>&gt;<i> features, as described on your last mail, is not an actual
</I>&gt;<i> requirement: it seems to be your try at addressing the security
</I>&gt;<i> requirement. For example, would you be happy with a solution that
</I>&gt;<i> allowed these features (to some reasonable degree, maybe comparable to
</I>&gt;<i> PMA) if it fulfilled all of the other requirements (including being
</I>&gt;<i> 100% secure)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First, let's look at what the currently existing solutions are: I may
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be missing some, but I hope the range is descriptive enough:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A) &lt;table&gt;+&lt;iframe&gt;: This meets requirements 1, 2, and 5 out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> box. Requirement 3 could be achieved with some javascript.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> B) CSS position:fixed + overflow:auto: Again, this meets requirements
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1, 2, and 5. Requirement 3 would also be achievable with a bit of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scripting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> C) Insane &lt;div&gt;s + CSS + Scripting: This essentially meets all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> requirements (maybe excluding 4, depending on what the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> requirement is); although at a high development cost. (This would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;MSDN style&quot; approach.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> D) HTML4 Frameset + HTML5 documents for frame contents: this meets
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> requirements 1, 2, 3, and 5 out of the box, it's an almost trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> upgrade from any HTML4 web-app that takes a similar approach, and is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> relatively easy to implement.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Seems to me many developers would regard B &amp; C as hacks. At they very least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they'd be more awkward than framesets. I think I've already touched on why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the MSDN approach is undesirable. You are not the first to claim that A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (tables &amp; iframes) can meet this spec. I'm not an HTML expert (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apparently frustrates you) but if A meets the spec, I ought to have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to find a working instance in the past six years or so, don't you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think? Or do you claim it's entirely fortuitous that the only publicly well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> known solutions for this spec use framesets?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> C) is definitely a hack. Even worse, it's a Microsoft hack.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than a hack, it's quite re-inventing the wheel: it takes a
</I>&gt;<i> purely structural element with no specific semantics or behavior
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;div&gt;) and uses other tools to define the appearance (CSS) and
</I>&gt;<i> behavior (scripting). So, of course, it's a heavy and probably
</I>&gt;<i> overkill application. Basically, it's been quite like migrating MS's
</I>&gt;<i> Document Explorer from the Windows platform to the web platform: it
</I>&gt;<i> works on the web, but it doesn't reuse too much of what web
</I>&gt;<i> technologies already provide.
</I>&gt;<i> B), on the other hand, is *not* a hack at all: using CSS this way for
</I>&gt;<i> these cases is exactly what these CSS properties were made for. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, the CSS approach fails on the resizing task; and that's were a
</I>&gt;<i> scripting-based hack can come into play; but CSS on itself is a
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate solution for a wide range of use cases, rather than a hack.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that your use case is not within this range, so the CSS
</I>&gt;<i> solution doesn't work for you; but that's legitimate: this is why we
</I>&gt;<i> are having this discussion, and my hopes are that it will led to the
</I>&gt;<i> best possible solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Re D), reasons for opposing removing framesets from HTML5 include: (i)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removal of a feature from a standard is often followed by further
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> degradation of support for it, which would undermine the functionality I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want HTML to support since framesets are commonly used, for good reasons, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meet this use case, (ii) there could be HTML5 features one would want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combine with framesets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apropos the strange claims made here that removal of framesets should make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no difference to present or future frameset use: if removal makes no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference whatever, there is no rationale for removing them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't claimed that the removal should make no difference. What I
</I>&gt;<i> have stated is that there is no such removal: Transitional/Strict
</I>&gt;<i> doctypes from HTML4 are being updated and combined into a single spec,
</I>&gt;<i> thus the &quot;version&quot; number is increased, leading to the &quot;HTML5&quot; term.
</I>&gt;<i> The Frameset document type stays untouched. The only reason there
</I>&gt;<i> isn't an &quot;HTML5 Frameset&quot; type is because it would be 100% identical
</I>&gt;<i> to the &quot;HTML4 Frameset&quot; one. There is no point in having two
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;versions&quot; of a spec that are actually the same.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, you don't need to bother too much about how the HTML5 spec
</I>&gt;<i> will impact on browser support for deprecated and non-updated
</I>&gt;<i> features: it simply won't. It's a matter of offer and demand: as long
</I>&gt;<i> as there are &lt;frameset&gt; or &lt;font&gt; tags out there, browsers will be
</I>&gt;<i> able to handle them, regardless of what the spec may say (currently,
</I>&gt;<i> the spec just tries to make the different UAs agree on how to handle
</I>&gt;<i> these and worse things).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your point on combining HTML5 features with framesets may be
</I>&gt;<i> interesting; but what prevents you from doing so now? The document
</I>&gt;<i> shown on each frame can perfectly be a HTML5 document. Using HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> features inside &lt;noframes&gt; would be quite unadvisable: if a UA can't
</I>&gt;<i> handle frames, would you really expect it to handle stuff like &lt;video&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> or &lt;gauge&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> That covers frame content, and no-frame content. Is there any other
</I>&gt;<i> place where you might want to use these features? If so, please,
</I>&gt;<i> elaborate (describe which features you'd need, where you'd need to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use them, and why).
