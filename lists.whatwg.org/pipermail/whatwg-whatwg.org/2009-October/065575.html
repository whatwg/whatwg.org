As far as I can tell, this is an IE bug; treating &quot;`&quot; as an attribute 
quoting character is non-conforming in any version of HTML so far, it 
seems. I'm certainly not going to make it non-conforming to stumble into 
any IE bug or difference in parsing between IE and previous specs or other 
browsers; we'd just end up with an asanine set of conformance 
requirements. For example, should this be non-conforming?

   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;form&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Search: &lt;input type=text&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=submit&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;

This perfectly innocent piece of HTML content (HTML2-compliant except for 
the DOCTYPE) results in a non-tree DOM in IE8. Should we make it 
non-conforming?

Similarly, IE conditional comments make it trivial to trigger scripts in 
IE but not another UA; indeed people do this on purpose. Should we make 
those non-conforming also?


As I understand it, the attack here is a site that allows the user to 
input text that is used verbatim in two attributes, such that the user can 
set the first attribute's value to:

   `

...and the second to:

   ` onload='...payload...' end=x

...with the assumption that the site is going to not quote the first one, 
and quote the second one with double quotes:

   &lt;body title=` class=&quot;` onload='...payload...' end=x&quot;&gt;

...which in IE, for some reason, gets treated as:

   &lt;body title=' class=&quot;'
         onload='...payload...'
         end='x&quot;'&gt;


I've disallowed ` in unquoted attribute values for now, but I think we 
should revert this once IE has fixed this bug for a few years.
