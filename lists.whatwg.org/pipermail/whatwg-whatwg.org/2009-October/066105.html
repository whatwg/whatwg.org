The connection might get closed at any point, e.g. between the script
checking if the connection might be closed and the script calling the 
send() method. Because of this, if we raised an exception when the 
connection was closed, we'd run the risk of the script randomly throwing 
an exception in a way that the author likely did not check for.

This isn't a problem for the CONNECTING case, since there is an event that 
fires before the script can use the send() method, and thus the author is 
unlikely to accidentally run into that exception in a way that wouldn't 
be quickly caught in testing.
