</I>
Usability of *HyperText* Markup Language involves being able to *link
to* the frameset as it is presented (which also means bookmarking).
Most users don't understand the concept of frames and don't understand
that when they bookmark a frameset (after having navigated within the
frames), what is bookmarked is not the &quot;page&quot; they were looking at
when they clicked the &quot;bookmark this page&quot; button.
While this can be made to work with JavaScript and (ab)using the #hash
part of the URL (&#224; la AJAX applications' browser history
handling/management), it however is a usability issue with frames to
begin with.

&gt;<i> I've not seen a counterexample. Have you?
</I>
I find MSDN as it is now much more usable than when it used frames,
even if that means that the treeview state (which subtree is
opened/closed) isn't preserves when navigating (but trees are not
&quot;first class citizen&quot; of web pages, they always involve JavaScript,
and in this case, localStorage or sessionStorage (or cookies, etc.)
could preserve the treeview state between pages; for the record,
&lt;datagrid&gt; was an attempt to make data grids, and trees, become
first-class citizens, but it wasn't &quot;stable&quot; enough and has been
removed for Last Call).
For example, compare:
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.generic.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.generic.aspx</A>
with
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/?../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/?../technotes/guides/collections/index.html</A>
(and note that this URL cannot be find in *any* link anywhere in the
JavaDoc, and requires JavaScript to display the &quot;The Collections
Framework&quot; page; while the MSDN page, even without JavaScript,
correctly displays the &quot;main content&quot; and can still be navigated,
though with highly degraded usability).

See also <A HREF="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/?flash/accessibility/AccessibilityProperties.html&amp;flash/accessibility/class-list.html">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/?flash/accessibility/AccessibilityProperties.html&amp;flash/accessibility/class-list.html</A>
(frames, same issue as JavaDoc, with the added possibility to control
the &quot;classList&quot; frame's content; only discoverable if you read the
JavaScript code in the frameset source)


&gt;&gt;<i>So this is all about assuming that the bit of pain will be enough of an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inconvenience
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for authors that they will either address the use case in some way not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involving iframes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>at all (and which presumably has a lower pain threshild; what is this way?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As above, no-one seems able to point to a non-frameset solution.
</I>
It depends if you consider the MSDN a non-frameset solution to your
&quot;problem&quot;; but I guess you're very attached to the &quot;doesn't affect
treeview state and scroll position&quot; thing (which isn't impossible to
solve; see above)

IMO, your mysqlquerytree example would be better solved using AJAX
(and innerHTML to inject the retrieved &quot;web parts&quot;): no need for
sessions on the server-side &#8211;at least for the treeview state storage&#8211;,
which means a more &quot;RESTful&quot; approach, with caching made possible
(even if it is only Vary:Cookie/Cache-Control:private, it's still
better than server state), scalability improvements (less data &#8211;state&#8211;
kept on the server, less requests to the server &#8211;caching *and* the
fact that it's a one-page thing: once you've loaded a subtree, even if
you collapse and re-open it, you don't have to reload it&#8211;)
... just like the Google Document Reader (here showing the GWT 1.5 doc):
