I don't know if there are pages that do this (and I sure hope none are 
using &lt;table&gt; for it!), but the lack of an existence proof is not proof of 
the lack of existence.

However, in the interests of moving this on, I made an example here in 
about ten minutes:

It doesn't do the resizing, and I didn't test it in IE so it probably 
needs some hacks to work around some bugs there, but it works fine for me 
in Safari. Resizing in a single page in general is a solved problem, you 
can probably slap a little JS on there and it would be supported too. (It 
should be easier to do, mind you; that's a CSS problem though, and affects 
more than just frames.)

</I>
Framesets don't block bookmarking of such rows. They just make it harder. 
(A user can always right-click a frame and get the URL to bookmark it.)

AJAX can block bookmarking of such rows, though.

That's fair enough, but framesets don't provide that possibility. They 
only make bookmarking significantly harder; they don't make it impossible. 
Indeed there have been a number of browsers over the years who have 
implemented various hacks whereby the user can bookmark the entire state 
of a frameset. The usability of such hacks has been poor, but the point is 
that if the requirement is that bookmarking not work, frames don't 
actually fulfill that need.
