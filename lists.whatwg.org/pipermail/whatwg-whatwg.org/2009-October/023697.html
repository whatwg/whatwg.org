I agree to that. I click a link on a page with an URI, and after 
clicking I get a new page with another URI - so if I hit the back 
button, I expect getting back the page I had seen before clicking the 
link. (Of course with the browser-specific peculiarities - Firefox e.g. 
remembers the scroll position, others may not...) The user experience 
when using the back button should not differ whether a browser supports 
@onlyreplace or not.

I admit I don't fully understand load events either. If I get it 
correctly, this is about functions called on load, that access elements 
in the replaceable parts of the page. A common use case for this is 
setting the focus on the first input element of a form. I don't think 
that this can be solved at the UA side, some authoring will be 
necessary; some possible workarounds are:
- Put page-specific scripts into a separate &lt;script&gt; element with an id, 
and include it in the @onlyreplace list;
- make one script that fits for all pages, by checking if an element 
exists before doing actions on it;
- instead of using &lt;body onLoad=&quot;foo()&quot;&gt;, put the function call into a 
&lt;script&gt; element at the bottom of the replaceable element.

Anyway such things would be much easier (with or without @onlyreplace) 
if the onLoad event handler would be allowed on every HTML element 
rather than on window and body only:
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;Name&quot; onLoad=&quot;this.focus()&quot;&gt;

But this looks that trivial to me - element.onLoad must have been 
suggested long ago and been declined for good reasons, I assume?
