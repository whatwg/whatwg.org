</I>Boris, I have agreed with your first response that I don't know enough 
about all the crazy things that people might be doing, to make this 
attribute to disappear. However I don't see how changing the default 
mime type will have any affect on the existing web pages and for web 
pages which will be authored in the next few years, as long as there are 
tested against IE8.

IMHO this attribute is a bug in the specification which is causing 
annoyance to any web developer which do not use IDE's to create forms. 
Changing the default the way I described might create a different 
annoyance, but in my opinion it will be a much lesser one.
