&gt;<i> Peter,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From reading this discussion, I think you've slightly missed a salient
</I>&gt;<i> point with regards to the current state of play with frames.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frames aren't in HTML 4.01 Strict, they were moved into their own standard,
</I>&gt;<i> HTML4.01 Frameset. With HTML5, they aren't being removed, they simply aren't
</I>&gt;<i> being updated. With no updates, their version, standard and DTD are going to
</I>&gt;<i> remain the same, namely HTML4.01 Frameset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you are actually arguing for therefore is the inclusion of all the
</I>&gt;<i> elements of HTML4.01 Frameset into HTML5 Strict and HTML5 Transitional. As
</I>&gt;<i> you seem to have no objection to how frames are handled in 4.01 it therefore
</I>&gt;<i> seems odd that you are arguing for a radical change for them in HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for people saying they are being 'removed' from HTML5, I see that as
</I>&gt;<i> merely a colloquial use of the term and what they actually mean is 'With the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 specification process, we aren't going to update the Frameset standard
</I>&gt;<i> and as such this standard has been removed from our scope'. I think you can
</I>&gt;<i> see why saying 'removed' is so much easier ;)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Edouard,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Use case: displaying tree-based content (editable or not). (Note: I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;omitting the database aspect because it only matters on the server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;side: once on the client, the page doesn't care whether the data comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;from/goes to a database, a collection of files, or anywhere else).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm afraid that empties meaning from the use case, whose requirements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significant to this discussion arise from the database context:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (i) the required page is a database maintenance webapp,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (ii) the data it maintains is in the form of a tree, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (iii) the objects of database maintenance (rows in the database tables
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which instantiate the tree) usually should not be bookmarkable for the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason other database webapps (eg phpMyAdmin) do not bookmark database
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data---a bookmark belongs to a browser, but a row of database table data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> belongs not to a browser but to users who may CRUD it, *and access to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such objects must not be shortcutted*. That is, database maintenance in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> webapp depends at least partly on protecting data from some popular web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanisms. If that offends HTML purists, or if this use case conflicts with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an &quot;original&quot; idea about the web, so be it. For this context, HTML is just a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> device for getting useful things done on the web while enforcing the rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of database maintenance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;First, let's look at what the currently existing solutions are: I may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;be missing some, but I hope the range is descriptive enough:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;A) &lt;table&gt;+&lt;iframe&gt;: This meets requirements 1, 2, and 5 out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;box. Requirement 3 could be achieved with some javascript.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;B) CSS position:fixed + overflow:auto: Again, this meets requirements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;1, 2, and 5. Requirement 3 would also be achievable with a bit of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;scripting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;C) Insane &lt;div&gt;s + CSS + Scripting: This essentially meets all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;requirements (maybe excluding 4, depending on what the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;requirement is); although at a high development cost. (This would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;the &quot;MSDN style&quot; approach.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;D) HTML4 Frameset + HTML5 documents for frame contents: this meets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;requirements 1, 2, 3, and 5 out of the box, it's an almost trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;upgrade from any HTML4 web-app that takes a similar approach, and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;relatively easy to implement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Seems to me many developers would regard B &amp; C as hacks. At they very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least they'd be more awkward than framesets. I think I've already touched on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why the MSDN approach is undesirable. You are not the first to claim that A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (tables &amp; iframes) can meet this spec. I'm not an HTML expert (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apparently frustrates you) but if A meets the spec, I ought to have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to find a working instance in the past six years or so, don't you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think? Or do you claim it's *entirely fortuitous* that the only publicly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well known solutions for this spec use framesets?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Re D), reasons for opposing removing framesets from HTML5 include: (i)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removal of a feature from a standard is often followed by further
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> degradation of support for it, which would undermine the functionality I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want HTML to support since framesets are commonly used, for good reasons, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meet this use case, (ii) there could be HTML5 features one would want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combine with framesets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apropos the strange claims made here that removal of framesets should make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no difference to present or future frameset use: *if removal makes no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference whatever, there is no rationale for removing them*.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Now, your last mail does describe the use-cases and their presumed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements. Your wording is maybe a bit messy, but you have at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided something worth discussing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just to make sure I (and others) are understanding your proposal as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intended, I'll try to paraphrase it in a more structured way (please,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if I got something wrong, just let me know):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Use case: displaying tree-based content (editable or not). (Note: I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> omitting the database aspect because it only matters on the server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side: once on the client, the page doesn't care whether the data comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from/goes to a database, a collection of files, or anywhere else).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Requirements:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) The display will use multiple subwindows, such as &quot;header&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;tree-view&quot;, and &quot;content&quot; (the names are arbitrary, hope they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> descriptive and concise).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) The subwindows (or some of them) need to be independently scrollable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) The subwindows must be resizable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) The tree structure being displayed may be protected through some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permission mechanism, so each user only gets to see or interact with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the nodes such user has permissions for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) The &quot;back button&quot; and &quot;bookmark&quot; features shouldn't work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So far, so good. Just if you had gone a bit further...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a use-case with a series of requirements. This is a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginning, but let's go to the next steps.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Requirement justification: you haven't provided any (it's the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements, not the use-case itself, what needs to be justified; a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use-case is inherently justified by the real-world needs it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addresses).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For requirements 1 to 3, I can assume as an implicit justification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like &quot;this is the behavior every user would expect&quot; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything like that, so let's move forward.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For requirement 4, things are a bit weird: should authentication be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handled on the server or on the client side? It seems that it has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be handled on the server side, so the nodes a user is not allowed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see should never be sent to the client (otherwise, the user could look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the source, hack through grease-monkey scripts, or override the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permission system in many ways). If it's handled by the server, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it isn't relevant to HTML: HTML is a client-side language. If there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some need to handle (part of) the authentication issue from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client, you should provide more details and justify such need;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise the requirement can just be omitted as it wouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relevant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Requirement 5 does need some justification. In my opinion, there is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need on your use case for these features (back button and bookmarks)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to work, but is there any real need for them to break? If there is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> please justify it; if there isn't, then that's not a requirement (it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would just be the absence of a requirement for these features to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work). Not needing them to work is *not* the same as needing them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, leaving aside the issues with the last two requirements, we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> move forward. The next step would be to see which requirements are met
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by currently existing solutions, and which aren't. I will be ignoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for now Requirement 4 because it's unclear what the actual requirement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, let's look at what the currently existing solutions are: I may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be missing some, but I hope the range is descriptive enough:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A) &lt;table&gt;+&lt;iframe&gt;: This meets requirements 1, 2, and 5 out of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> box. Requirement 3 could be achieved with some javascript.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B) CSS position:fixed + overflow:auto: Again, this meets requirements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1, 2, and 5. Requirement 3 would also be achievable with a bit of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C) Insane &lt;div&gt;s + CSS + Scripting: This essentially meets all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements (maybe excluding 4, depending on what the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirement is); although at a high development cost. (This would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;MSDN style&quot; approach.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> D) HTML4 Frameset + HTML5 documents for frame contents: this meets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements 1, 2, 3, and 5 out of the box, it's an almost trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upgrade from any HTML4 web-app that takes a similar approach, and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relatively easy to implement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally, once it is shown that currently existing solutions can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle the use-case (which hasn't been shown: C and D both can, and A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and B can as well if a bit of scripting is added to handle the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resizing requirement), it would only be left to verify that your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal actually meets the requirements. There is a problem here,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however: What is your proposal? I'm not sure why you haven't described
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your proposal. If you want the editor to change the spec, it's quite a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good idea to describe the changes you want to be made on the spec.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In summary, what you need to do is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Correct me if I made any mistakes when trying to synthesize your use-case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Clarify and justify Requirement 4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Justify Requirement 5.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Describe your proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Show how does your proposal meet all of the requirements for the use-case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as this has gone, my impression is that you want a HTML5
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Frameset document type that is exactly identical to the HTML 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version. It is pointless to &quot;update&quot; a version of a standard to a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version that includes no changes at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Keep in mind that Frameset and content are two different document
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> types, with different content models (for example, a frameset page has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no &lt;body&gt;). HTML5 currently replaces/updates the Transitional/Strict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document types; it doesn't deal with Frameset because nothing is being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changed on it, so HTML4 Frameset stays valid as the &quot;newest&quot; (despite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its age) standard for frameset &quot;master&quot; pages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
