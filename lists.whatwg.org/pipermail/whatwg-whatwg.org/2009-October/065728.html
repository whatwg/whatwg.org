While I agree that it is probably an authoring error if the author 
included a type=file control on a page with the default enctype, I don't 
think the magic of changing the default in that case would help authors on 
the long run. Consider, for instance, an author who sets up his form with 
a file upload control, gets everything working, and then decides to remove 
the file upload control because they don't actually use it, or because 
it's optional and they want a script to add it dynamically. They might 
find that suddenly their form doesn't work, but as far as they are 
concerned all they did was remove a form control that wasn't used in the 
first place.

I think this would be too confusing.
