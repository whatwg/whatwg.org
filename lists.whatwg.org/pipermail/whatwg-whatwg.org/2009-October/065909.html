Turning off anti-aliasing just trades one problems for another.

IT seems like what we should really do is either have UAs oversample 
without antialiasing and then downsample for rendering, or, if that is 
considered too expensive, provide primitives that make this a non-problem. 
For example, instead of just having the ability to draw rectangles, maybe 
we need the ability to specify a number of rectangles, and then have them 
all drawn at once, so that if they are adjacent, the UA can render them 
without the anti-aliasing artifacts between them.

In either case, it seems like something best handled in a future version.
