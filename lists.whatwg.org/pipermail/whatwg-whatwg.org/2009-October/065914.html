Because as far as I can tell there's no reason a plugin's behaviour should 
depend on whether it is visible or not. And because Boris said so. :-)

Ah, I see. So your concern is with the case where &lt;object 
type=&quot;text/plain&quot; data=&quot;x&quot;&gt; is specified, if the user has a plugin that 
supports text/plain, and &quot;x&quot; contains data that is invalid in text/plain 
content. In this case, you would like the plugin to be invoked, even if 
sniffing the content would find that it was in fact some other format 
(e.g. flash).

That seems reasonable. I've changed the spec to prevent sniffing in this 
case.


&gt;<i> Perform the sniffing such that it detects as either text/plain or 
</I>&gt;<i> application/octet-stream.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then if it's application/octet-stream we'll end up using the @type. 
</I>&gt;<i> Though see below on other sniffing issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This does fail to sniff text/plain as the various &quot;non-scriptable&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> types, but I question how desirable that is anyway, honestly.  If we 
</I>&gt;<i> want to preserve this property without clobbering @type=&quot;text/plain&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> then I need to think a bit more about how to specify the behavior here.
</I>
I'm a bit concerned about introducing even more sniffing algorithms (which 
this effectively is) rather than just reusing the existing ones. Why would 
we not want text/plain to be treated more or less the same here as in an 
&lt;iframe&gt;?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My concern about text/plain data being sniffed as text/html by your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; current algorithm (even with the changes you've made) seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remain unaddressed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I thought I had. Can you walk me through how anything labeled 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text/plain could get sniffed as text/html with the new text?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.  Assume the type attribute is not set and HTML data is sent as 
</I>&gt;<i> text/plain and contains a &quot;binary byte&quot; in the first 512 bytes (can just 
</I>&gt;<i> stick it in the &lt;title&gt; or something).  Also assume no plug-in claims to 
</I>&gt;<i> support the URI's file extension.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At step 3, the resource type is set to text/plain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At step 4, the resource type is sniffed as application/octet-stream, since
</I>&gt;<i> text/html is marked as scriptable in [MIMESNIFFF].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At step 5, there is no @type, and the resource type is
</I>&gt;<i> application/octet-stream, so the resource type is changed to unknown.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At step 6, nothing changes since there is no plug-in supporting the URI's file
</I>&gt;<i> extension.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At step 7, the resource type is &quot;unknown&quot;, so it is changed to the &quot;sniffed
</I>&gt;<i> type of the resource&quot;.
</I>
Ooh, yes. good catch. Hm.

I've forced it to text/plain in this case. (To be precise, I've changed 
the algorithm slightly so that you only do the sniffing once -- either the 
text-v-binary sniff, or the full sniff, and if the text-v-binary sniff 
just says application/octet-stream but the extension doesn't help, then I 
convert it back to text/plain.)

Note that in practice this makes no difference, unless there is a plugin 
that supports text/html or text/plain. If there is no such plugin, then 
the end result is that a browsing context is created, and the resource is 
treated as normal (including sniffing it again properly).

I've added a note to this effect.


There was also some discussion of what to do about preventing a plugin 
instantiating. It seems to me that authors can do that by not creating the 
&lt;object&gt; element ahead of time.
