What Michael said.

No, that would prevent the application cache ever getting cached, IIRC.

</I>
Done.

Resources that are actually in the cache still win over the offline 
whitelist namespace.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) It solves the problem of client-side backups

</I>&gt;<i> How could it work? In response to an onsave event, the app could return

</I>&gt;<i> which I personally consider vital for the evolution of the web.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What about clients where there is no user-accessible file system, like

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
Applications want to save state continually, not just at user checkpoints.

Applications want to save state without the user really knowing that it is 
state.

So I don't think this really solves the problem.

Also at this point IE8 has shipped the localStorage API, so I think we're 
basically stuck with it.

</I>
I think it's wrong to think of Web Apps as distinct from Documents. Is 
a Google Search results page an Application or a Document? It might want 
to save state, e.g. to remember whether you want Safe Search enabled or 
not. Should you have to do File | Save to save that state? What about if 
you want to save the results of a search to a file?

The App Cache model downloads the manifest before and after the cache, and 
only if the file has not changed in between does it actually use the new 
files. If the cache changed, it blows everything away and tries again.

Now if the CDN is such that different files are at different versions, 
then you have problems whether or not you are using appcache. Just going 
to the site could result in the user seeing a mishmash of new and old 
files. Don't do that. :-)
