</I>&gt;<i> quoting character is non-conforming in any version of HTML so far, it 
</I>&gt;<i> seems. I'm certainly not going to make it non-conforming to stumble into 
</I>&gt;<i> any IE bug or difference in parsing between IE and previous specs or other 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers; we'd just end up with an asanine set of conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements.
</I>
I agree that it's pointless to make it non-conforming to hit any parsing 
bug, but I would argue that we should make as many cases as it is 
sensible to do so non-conforming if they open up security holes in 
websites on legacy UAs, given that website uses a HTML 5 
parser/sanitizer/serializer.

&gt;<i> For example, should this be non-conforming?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;label&gt;Search: &lt;input type=text&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;input type=submit&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This perfectly innocent piece of HTML content (HTML2-compliant except for 
</I>&gt;<i> the DOCTYPE) results in a non-tree DOM in IE8. Should we make it 
</I>&gt;<i> non-conforming?
</I>
No, it opens up no security hole if that is done.

&gt;<i> Similarly, IE conditional comments make it trivial to trigger scripts in 
</I>&gt;<i> IE but not another UA; indeed people do this on purpose. Should we make 
</I>&gt;<i> those non-conforming also?
</I>
They are a harder issue, but I think it is probably fair enough to 
assume that most sanitizers drop comments for such reasons, hence making 
them fine to leave as conforming also.

&gt;<i> As I understand it, the attack here is a site that allows the user to 
</I>&gt;<i> input text that is used verbatim in two attributes, such that the user can 
</I>&gt;<i> set the first attribute's value to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    `
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...and the second to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    ` onload='...payload...' end=x
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...with the assumption that the site is going to not quote the first one, 
</I>&gt;<i> and quote the second one with double quotes:
</I>
(This is the default behaviour of Python html5lib, FWIW: the first is 
not quoted as it does not contain any whitespace characters or U+003E 
(&gt;), the latter is quoted for that reason.)

&gt;<i>    &lt;body title=` class=&quot;` onload='...payload...' end=x&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...which in IE, for some reason, gets treated as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;body title=' class=&quot;'
</I>&gt;<i>          onload='...payload...'
</I>&gt;<i>          end='x&quot;'&gt;
</I>
Indeed, this is the attack I (and others) am concerned about.

&gt;<i> I've disallowed ` in unquoted attribute values for now, but I think we 
</I>&gt;<i> should revert this once IE has fixed this bug for a few years.
</I>
Right, once versions of IE with this bug have faded out of existence I 
think this will become a non-issue. I also expect that'll be a while 
yet, though, and I highly doubt that time will have come even by the 
time when HTML 5 goes to REC. Furthermore, if there are similar attacks 
to this, I think they should similarly be made non-conforming.
