</I>&gt;<i> away the rest.  More specifically, suppose we mark the dynamic content 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the static.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say we add a new attribute to &lt;a&gt;, like &lt;a onlyreplace=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> where &quot;foo&quot; is the id of an element on the page.  Or better, a 
</I>&gt;<i> space-separated list of elements.  When the user clicks such a link, the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser should do something like this: change the URL in the navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> bar to the indicated URL, and retrieve the indicated resource and begin 
</I>&gt;<i> to parse it.  Every time an element is encountered that has an id in the 
</I>&gt;<i> onlyreplace list, if there is an element on the current page with that 
</I>&gt;<i> id, remove the existing element and then add the element from the new 
</I>&gt;<i> page.  I guess this should be done in the usual fashion, first appending 
</I>&gt;<i> the element itself and then its children recursively, leaf-first.

</I>&gt;<i> Single-page apps are already becoming common for js-heavy sites.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> obvious example is something like Gmail, but it's becoming more common 
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere.  The main benefit of doing this is that you never dump the 
</I>&gt;<i> script context, so you only have to parse/execute/apply scripting *once* 
</I>&gt;<i> across the page, making really heavy libraries actually usable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, writing a single-page app was explicitly given as a suggestion 
</I>&gt;<i> in the &quot;Global Script&quot; thread.  Even in contexts with lighter scripts, 
</I>&gt;<i> there can still be substantial run-time rewriting of the page which a 
</I>&gt;<i> single-page app can avoid doing multiple times (frex, transforming a 
</I>&gt;<i> nested list into a tree control).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem, though, is that single-page apps are currently a bit clunky 
</I>&gt;<i> to write.  They require javascript to function, and the necessary code 
</I>&gt;<i> is relatively large and clunky, even in libraries like jQuery which make 
</I>&gt;<i> the process much simpler.  It requires you to architect your site around 
</I>&gt;<i> the design, either producing a bunch of single-widget files that you 
</I>&gt;<i> query for and slap into place, or some relatively complex client-side 
</I>&gt;<i> logic to parse data structures into HTML.  It's also very hard to get 
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility and graceful degradation right, requiring you to basically 
</I>&gt;<i> completely duplicate everything in a static form.  Finally, preserving 
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarkability/general deeplinking (such as from a search engine) 
</I>&gt;<i> requires significant effort with history management and url hacking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Aryeh's suggestion, though, solves *all* of these problems with a single 
</I>&gt;<i> trivial attribute.  You first design a static multi-page site like 
</I>&gt;<i> normal, with the only change being this attribute on your navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> links specifying the dynamic/replaceable portions of the page.  In a 
</I>&gt;<i> legacy client, then, you have a perfectly serviceable multipage site, 
</I>&gt;<i> with the only problems being the reloading of js and such on each 
</I>&gt;<i> pageload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a supporting client, though, clicking a link causes the browser to 
</I>&gt;<i> perform an ordinary request for the target page (requiring *no* special 
</I>&gt;<i> treatment from the author), parse/treebuild the new page, and then yank 
</I>&gt;<i> out the relevant fragments and replace bits in the current page with 
</I>&gt;<i> them.  The url/history automatically updates properly; bookmarking the 
</I>&gt;<i> page and visiting it later will take you to appropriate static page that 
</I>&gt;<i> already exists.  Script context is maintained, listeners stay around, 
</I>&gt;<i> overall page state remains stable across 'pageloads'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a declarative, accessible, automatic, and EASY way of creating the 
</I>&gt;<i> commonest form of single-page apps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This brings benefits to more than just the traditional js-heavy apps. My 
</I>&gt;<i> company's web site utilizes jQuery for a lot of small upgrades in the 
</I>&gt;<i> page template (like a hover-expand accordion for the main nav), and for 
</I>&gt;<i> certain things on specific pages.  I know that loading the library, and 
</I>&gt;<i> applying the template-affecting code, slows down my page loads, but it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not significant enough to be worth the enormous effort to create an 
</I>&gt;<i> accessible, search-engine friendly single-page app.  This would solve my 
</I>&gt;<i> problem trivially, though, providing a better overall UI to my visitors 
</I>&gt;<i> (snappier page loads) without any real effort on my part, and without 
</I>&gt;<i> harming accessibility or SEO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This also trivially replaces most/all uses of bad mechanisms like 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;frameset&gt; used to address similar problems (such as maintaining state 
</I>&gt;<i> on a complex nav).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only addition I'd make to this is to allow a tag in the &lt;head&gt; that 
</I>&gt;<i> specifies default replaceability for all same-origin links. Perhaps just 
</I>&gt;<i> an attribute on &lt;base&gt;?  It would accept a space-separated list of ids, 
</I>&gt;<i> just like the @onlyreplace attribute on &lt;a&gt;s.  An @onlyreplace attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> on a link would completely override this default (this would allow me 
</I>&gt;<i> to, frex, have the mainnav only replace the subnav, while all other 
</I>&gt;<i> links replace the content instead).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that the single-page app pattern solves a lot of problems that 
</I>&gt;<i> exist today and will persist into the future, and that it's worthy of 
</I>&gt;<i> being made into a declarative, html-supported mechanism.  I also believe 
</I>&gt;<i> that Aryeh's suggestion is the correct way to go about this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only problem I can see with this is that it's possible for authors 
</I>&gt;<i> to believe that they only need to actually write a single full page, and 
</I>&gt;<i> can just link to fragments containing only the chunk of content to be 
</I>&gt;<i> replaced.  This would mostly break bookmarking and deeplinking, as 
</I>&gt;<i> visitors would just receive a chunk of unstyled content separated from 
</I>&gt;<i> the overall page template.  However, because it breaks so *visibly* and 
</I>&gt;<i> reliably (unlike, say, framesets, which just break bookmarking by 
</I>&gt;<i> sending you to the 'main page'), I think there would be sufficient 
</I>&gt;<i> pressure for authors to get this right, especially since it's so *easy* 
</I>&gt;<i> to get it right.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. &lt;iframe&gt;s, like frames before them, break bookmarking.  If a user 
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarks the page and returns to it later, or gets deeplinked via a 
</I>&gt;<i> search engine or a link from a friend, the &lt;iframe&gt; won't show the 
</I>&gt;<i> correct content.  The only way around this is some fairly non-trivial 
</I>&gt;<i> url-hacking with javascript, altering the displayed url as the user 
</I>&gt;<i> navigates the iframe, and parsing a deeplink url into an appropriate url 
</I>&gt;<i> for the iframe on initial pageload.  @onlyreplace, on the other hand, 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically works perfectly with bookmarking.  The UA still changes 
</I>&gt;<i> urls and inserts history appropriately as you navigate, and on a fresh 
</I>&gt;<i> pageload it just requests the ordinary static page showing the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. &lt;a target&gt; can only navigate one iframe at a time.  Many/most sites, 
</I>&gt;<i> though, have multiple dynamic sections scattered throughout the page.  
</I>&gt;<i> The main site for my company, frex, has 3 (content, breadcrumbs, and 
</I>&gt;<i> section nav) which *cannot* be combined to display as a single &lt;iframe&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> at least not without including a whole bunch of static content as well.  
</I>&gt;<i> You'd have use javascript to hook the links and manually navigate the 
</I>&gt;<i> additional iframes.  @onlyreplace, on the other hand, handles this 
</I>&gt;<i> seamlessly - just include multiple ids in the attribute value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. &lt;iframe&gt;s require you to architect your site around them.  Rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than a series of independent pages, you must create a single master page 
</I>&gt;<i> and then a number of content-chunk mini-pages.  This breaks normal 
</I>&gt;<i> authoring practices (though in some ways it's easier), and requires you 
</I>&gt;<i> to work hard to maintain accessibility and such in the face of these 
</I>&gt;<i> atrophied mini-pages.  @onlyreplace works on full, ordinary pages.  
</I>&gt;<i> It's *possible* to link to a content-chunk mini-page instead, but this 
</I>&gt;<i> will spectacularly break if you ever deeplink straight to one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> pages, so it should become automatic for authors to do this correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. &lt;iframe&gt;s have dubious accessibility and search effects.  I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know if bots can navigate &lt;a target&gt; links appropriately.  I also 
</I>&gt;<i> believe that this causes problems with screen-readers.  While either of 
</I>&gt;<i> these sets of UAs can be rewritten to handle &lt;iframe&gt;s better (and 
</I>&gt;<i> handle @onlyreplace replacement as well), with @onlyreplace they *also* 
</I>&gt;<i> have the option of just completely ignoring the attribute and navigating 
</I>&gt;<i> the site as an ordinary multi-page app.  Legacy UAs will automatically 
</I>&gt;<i> do so, providing perfect backwards compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. One of the big beneficiaries of @onlyreplace will be fairly ordinary 
</I>&gt;<i> sites that are currently using an ordinary multi-page architecture.  
</I>&gt;<i> All they have to do is add a single tag to the &lt;head&gt; of their pages, 
</I>&gt;<i> and they automatically get the no-flicker refresh of a single-page app.  
</I>&gt;<i> These sites are *already* grabbing the whole page on each request, so 
</I>&gt;<i> @onlyreplace won't make them take any *additional* bandwidth.  It will 
</I>&gt;<i> merely make the user experience smoother by reducing flicker and keeping 
</I>&gt;<i> js-heavy elements of the page template alive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Even though site templates are usually weighter than the dynamic 
</I>&gt;<i> portions of a site, it's still not a very significant wasteage.  For 
</I>&gt;<i> comparison, my company's main site is roughly 16kb of template, and 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere around 2-3k of dynamic page content.  (Aryeh - I gave you 
</I>&gt;<i> slightly different numbers in chat because I was counting wrong.)  So 
</I>&gt;<i> that's a good 85% of each request being thrown away as irrelevant. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, it's also *only 16kb*, and that's UNCOMPRESSED - after standard 
</I>&gt;<i> gzip compression the template is worth maybe 5kb.  So I waste 5kb of 
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth per request.  Big deal.  (According to Philip`, my company's 
</I>&gt;<i> site's weight is just on the low side of average.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Because this is a declarative mechanism (specifying WHAT you want, 
</I>&gt;<i> not HOW to get it), it has great potential for transparent optimizations 
</I>&gt;<i> behind the scenes.  For example, the browser could tell the server which 
</I>&gt;<i> bits it's interested in replacing, and the server could automatically 
</I>&gt;<i> strip full pages down to only those chunks.  This would eliminate 
</I>&gt;<i> virtually all bandwidth waste, while still being completely transparent 
</I>&gt;<i> to the author - they just create ordinary full static pages.  Heck, you 
</I>&gt;<i> could even handle this yourself with JS and a bit of server-side coding, 
</I>&gt;<i> intercepting clicks and rewriting the urls to pass the @onlyreplace data 
</I>&gt;<i> in a query parameter, and have a server-side script determine what to 
</I>&gt;<i> return based on that.  Less automatic, but fairly simple, and still 
</I>&gt;<i> easier than using JS to do this in the normal AJAX manner.  (And UAs 
</I>&gt;<i> that don't run javascript but do support @onlyreplace will still work 
</I>&gt;<i> properly, just with a bit more bandwidth waste.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Semantically the replace operation should be identical to grabbing the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate chunk of text from the new page and setting is as the 
</I>&gt;<i> outerHTML of the appropriate element.  Any &lt;script&gt;s that are located 
</I>&gt;<i> within this chunk would run in the exact same manner.  Scripts elsewhere 
</I>&gt;<i> in the new page would not be run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> document.write()s contained in &lt;script&gt; blocks inside the target 
</I>&gt;<i> fragment will run when they get inserted into the page, but 
</I>&gt;<i> document.write()s outside of that won't.  Producing the target fragment 
</I>&gt;<i> with document.write() is a no-go from the start. Don't do that anyway; 
</I>&gt;<i> it's a bad idea.

My recomendation would be to follow the process for adding features:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F</A>

In particular the bit about experimental implementations. I think this 
idea looks very interesting, but it's hard to evaluate without concrete 
experience with a browser implementing this (or, as Jonas suggests, a 
library that hacks it in).

It seems like the kind of thing that we could adopt early on in the next 
feature cycle, if it turns out to be a good solid model.
