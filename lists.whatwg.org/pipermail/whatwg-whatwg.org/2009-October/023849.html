<PRE>
For a brief period today, there were no outstanding e-mails or bugs on the 
specs, and so I took that opportunity to transition us here at the WHATWG 
to the next stage of HTML5's development: Last Call! This affects three 
specs at the WHATWG:

 * HTML5
   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/</A>

 * Web Workers
   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/</A>

 * Microdata vocabularies
   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/vocabs/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/vocabs/current-work/</A>

There's also a version of the spec called Web Applications 1.0 (for 
nostalgic reasons) that has all of the above as well as a number of other 
specs, namely Web Storage, Web Database, Server-sent Events, and the Web 
Sockets API and protocol, all together in one document. With the exception 
of the Web Database spec, they're all now in last call at the WHATWG:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html</A> (5MB)

So if you've been waiting to see if someone else would report the problem 
that you had seen, well, if it's not fixed, they didn't! So you should now 
send that feedback in yourself.

If you sent an e-mail or filed a bug that I haven't replied to, then 
please send it again. A few weeks ago I noticed that I was losing about 1% 
of e-mail to a rogue and overeager spam filter, and I don't know how long 
that had been going on, so if I didn't reply that's probably why.

(Note that this only applies to the WHATWG -- the W3C HTML WG is not yet 
at Last Call.)
