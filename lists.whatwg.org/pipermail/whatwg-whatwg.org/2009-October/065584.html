You can use multipart/form-data with a form that doesn't include any 
file uploads (and people do this).  Presumably they might have reasons 
for this (e.g. they happen to have a sane multipart MIME parsing library 
and don't want to deal with the url-encoding mess the 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded option produces.
