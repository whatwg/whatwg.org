That's a fourth storage mechanism, so my comments above apply.

I believe you can test if a key is in the storage area using:

   if (key in storage) { ... }

For example:

   if ('document' in window.localStorage) { ... }

</I>
I think everyone agrees that we need a storage mechanism in workers; the 
question is what it should be. That's basically the same as the question 
of what should happen with the Web Database spec -- I don't think we would 
want to end up with multiple storage systems in workers. The answer to 
this question depends on the result of this debate in the Web Apps WG.

The main use case is storing File objects when offline for later upload. I 
think that far outweighs the negatives you list above. We need this, and 
there's no other storage mechanism that everyone agrees is good enough.

</I>
The global variables have implicit locks such that you can build the tools 
for explicit locking on top of them:

   // run this first, in one script block
   var id = localStorage['last-id'] + 1;
   localStorage['last-id'] = id;
   localStorage['email-ready-' + id] = &quot;0&quot;; // &quot;begin&quot;

   // these can run each in separate script blocks as desired
   localStorage['email-subject-' + id] = subject;
   localStorage['email-from-' + id] = from;
   localStorage['email-to-' + id] = to;
   localStorage['email-body-' + id] = body;

   // run this last
   localStorage['email-ready-' + id] = &quot;1&quot;; // &quot;commit&quot;

</I>
You can only lose the lock in very specific conditions. Those conditions 
are rarely going to interact with code that actually does storage work in 
a way that relies on the lock:

 - changing document.domain
 - history.back(), .forward(), .go(n)
 - invoking a plugin
 - alert(), confirm(), prompt(), print()
 - showModalDialog()
 - yieldForStorageUpdates()

I discussed this in more detail here:

I don't think it's desirable. It's just what we have, though an accident 
of history.


Where we're at: localStorage can't really change. It is what it is.

We have a better proposal, Web Database, but not everybody wants to 
implement it.

To move forward, I would recommend that someone come up with a storage 
proposal with the following characteristics:

 * All major browsers vendors are willing to implement it.
 * Compatible with workers.
 * Doesn't have any race conditions.
 * Doesn't involve a cross-process mutex that blocks interaction.
 * Stores structured data.
 * Can be queried in arbitrary ways.
 * Doesn't expose authors to locking primitives.

Then we can replace Web Database with it and we can move on.

I suggest that the right venue for this discussion would be the W3C Web 
Apps group, at <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">public-webapps at w3.org.</A>

You can only do that with same-domain pages, as far as I can tell.

(Does that really have to be synchronous? Right now we don't define the 
'scroll' event anywhere. What are the semantics it needs?)

I think it's important to include this paragraph in a discussion of the 
privacy implications of these APIs. I feel like it would be irresponsible 
of me to not include this text, given how important this actually is.


&gt;<i> As to what browser vendors should actually _do_, it seems to me that the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;user's expectations of privacy&quot; is actually an illusion in this case; 
</I>&gt;<i> all the bad stuff that can be done with persistent storage can already

</I>&gt;<i> particularly as it can lead to the type of problem that Jens described

</I>
Cookie resurrection has been a real concern on the Web. I don't think it's 
an illusion.


&gt;<i> On a slightly different topic, it is unclear what the relationship 
</I>&gt;<i> between the statement in section 4.3 &quot;User agents should expire data

</I>&gt;<i> automatically delete stored data after a period of time.&quot; is supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> be. Does the latter count as a security reason?
</I>
I've edited the latter text to indicate that the expiration should only be 
done at user option.

</I>
I don't see why it would add significantly more use. Once a site is using 
localStorage, whether it has structured storage natively or not, they're 
going to store structured data in it -- e.g. using JSON, as some people 
have said they already are -- and so I don't think that this effectively 
increases the usage. It just makes it simpler for those who do use it.


&gt;<i> If use increases, then 4 implies that the storage lock is going to 
</I>&gt;<i> become a bigger problem over time.  Since we can all agree that the 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous design of local storage is already a problem that we wish we

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have an argument against this?

I don't think it makes it a significantly bigger problem.


&gt;<i> Anyone who's going to use LocalStorage in the near to medium future will 
</I>&gt;<i> need to handle the case of LocalStorage only handling strings.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> because structured clones supports a super-set of what can be serialized 
</I>&gt;<i> within a script, there's no way for libraries to build a transparent

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> alternatives will take some time, but do we really believe that we can't

</I>
I think it makes sense to allow Files to be stored today.

However, I'm all for a better API. So if you can get people to agree to a 
better API before anyone ships this one and before pages start depending 
on it, then maybe we can remove the structured storage feature from 
localStorage.
