While this may be true (and I'm not sure it's as true as one would like) 
some of these &quot;frameworks&quot; are more or less capable than others.  Some 
expect the data in a _very_ particular format (such that changing the 
order of elements in the submitted data, for example breaks them); I 
would not expect them to switch easily between different enctypes.

</I>
A surprising amount of form POST processing seems to happen in an exe on 
the server, not in any sort of modern scripting language.  At least 
based on the bugs we've gotten filed whenever we change anything about it.
