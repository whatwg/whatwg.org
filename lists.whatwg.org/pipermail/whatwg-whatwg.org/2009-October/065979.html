Sure, but you're still just trading one problem for another. What if you 
want neither aliasing (i.e. you don't want 1 bit clipping paths) nor the 
problem to which ou allude (i.e. painting can't be done incrementally)?
Surely it's best to solve both problems rather than force authors to pick 
which problem they want.


&gt;<i> The setTimeout/setInterval loop (intrinsic to Canvas, via Window... and

You can't know, in the current setup, which lines are supposed to be 
adjacent and which lines are supposed to be superimposed.


&gt;<i> &gt; In either case, it seems like something best handled in a future

Right.


&gt;<i> As far as I can tell; the area (width and height, extent) of source image A

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And so in Chrome, when composting with a shape, the extent of image A is

The problem is in defining what this means, exactly. As Philip` mentioned, 
other browsers do do what the spec says (Opera in particular does a very 
good job).

I've made this more explicit, though.

Sure. I don't know that we want to be encouraging people to abstract away 
this API even further, though... it's already quite the stack of APIs as 
it is (video driver API, GUI API, platform-independent framework like 
Cairo, internal browser API, JS API...).

We'll be adding this (and many other metrics) once browsers have the 
fundamentals (like globalCompositeOperation) more reliably implemented.
