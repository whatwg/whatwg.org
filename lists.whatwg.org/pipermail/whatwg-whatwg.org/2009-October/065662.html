No, it is entirely about antialiasing. Coverage-based antialiasing causes
problems whenever you draw two objects with adjacent edges that aren't
aligned to pixel boundaries. It doesn't matter whether those boundaries are
induced by clipping or just by filling a path. The post you linked to even
refers to this:

The second problem with anti-aliasing, even when done correctly, is that it
&gt;<i> makes it impossible to put polygons next to each other. Try this demo&lt;<A HREF="http://tulrich.com/geekstuff/canvas/perspective.html">http://tulrich.com/geekstuff/canvas/perspective.html</A>&gt;in Firefox and note the hairlines caused by anti-aliasing.
</I>&gt;<i>

Personally I'm not a big fan of coverage-based antialiasing for exactly this
reason, but it's the most common antialiasing technique in graphics
libraries so it's hard to get away from.
