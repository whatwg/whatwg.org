</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please file specific bugs or send specific e-mails for each example you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think should be reworked; there are over 300 examples in the spec and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without knowing what is wrong with each one, if I just go through them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and change them, they're just going to go from one kind of bad example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another kind of bad example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I decided to start already with an example. I went through some old code to find a suitable use-case and I found one that I think might be beneficial since it is used quite often on all sorts of sites in one shape or another. But right from the start I get stuck.
</I>&gt;<i> The existing (HTML4) code is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The page has a header and a footer which we will disregard for the sake of this example. Between this header and footer we have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div id=&quot;detail&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&lt;img src=&quot;example1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example1_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example2_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example3_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example4_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in essence, we are talking about a portfolio (with some AJAX in the background which we will ignore). Clicking on a thumbnail in the &lt;ul&gt; will show the detailed picture inside the &lt;div&gt;. I left out arguments which have no bearing on the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> Depending on your point of view one will or will not call this an application, so in itself it is a good example of ambiguous content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How should this be redone in HTML5? I come across the following questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Should this entire code be wrapped in a &lt;section&gt;? The argument for it being that this entire portfolio should show up in the outline as a whole. The argument against it being that since it is the only content on the page no &lt;section&gt; is needed and that it is conceivable that in the future extra content could be added in between the &lt;div&gt; and the &lt;ul&gt; which is not related to either.
</I>
No need if, as you say, this is the only content on the page (+ header
and footer).  &lt;body&gt; is an implicit sectioning root.

&gt;<i> 2) Should the &lt;div&gt; be replaced by &lt;section&gt;? The argument being that this detail-picture is actually the main content of the page and could also include extra information (like a textual description) in the future. The argument against is simply that the &lt;img&gt; is adequately semantic and the &lt;div&gt; is there only for lay-out/scripting.
</I>
Without any further context, I'm going to assume that the &lt;div&gt; is
indeed purely a styling/scripting hook.  In that case, it should
remain a &lt;div&gt;.

&gt;<i> 3) Should the &lt;ul&gt; be wrapped in an &lt;aside&gt;? Since it is definitely related to the detail-picture. But see also 5)
</I>
Definitely not; it's part of the application.  From your snippet, the
page seems to be built as a picture-app, which means both the image
and the thumbnails work together; neither is tangential to the purpose
of the page like a sidebar would be.

&gt;<i> 4) Should the &lt;ul&gt; be replaced by a &lt;nav&gt;? Argument for it is that clicking on a thumbnail changes (part of) the page and is therefore not a &quot;true&quot; list of items but a form of navigation. The argument against is that it is highly debatable if this constitutes a real form of navigation.
</I>
No, it probably shouldn't be a &lt;nav&gt;.  It's possible to argue for it,
but this probably isn't a &quot;primary navigation&quot; for the page.  It's
just part of the application.

&gt;<i> 5) Now stretching a bit, it is conceivable that someone may argue that the thumbnails are actually the main-content and that the detail-picture is nothing more than a detail of part of that content.
</I>
Nah, both pieces work together to create the application.  Arguing
that is really esoteric semantic-hacking, and isn't necessary.
