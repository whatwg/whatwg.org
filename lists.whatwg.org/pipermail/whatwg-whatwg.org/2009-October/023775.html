Actually, though, I think that the problem won't be nearly as bad as
you're implying.

You're imagining that it takes as long to decide if the requested
elements are in the page as it would take to actually render the page.
 This is *far* from true.  Looking at the Net panel data in Firebug
for my company's website on a full refresh, actually downloading the
page takes only 150-200ms.  I'm told that the actual parsing is
basically insignificant compared to network latencies.

Assuming that the DOM-building proceeds identically to that employed
by responseXML (except allowing HTML, as XHR2 says), in the worst-case
scenario embedded scripts may run in case of document.write() (though
Anne says that he plans to *not* run scripts while parsing HTML into
responseXML), but linked scripts won't ever download.  And, of course,
once the DOM is built checking for ids is trivial.  So for a typical
page (as I said earlier, my company's page is apparently just on the
low end of average) we're looking at response times under half a
second.
