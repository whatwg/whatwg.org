</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and &lt;hgroup&gt; exists to resolve ambiguity caused by presentational use of 
</I>&gt;<i> headers.
</I>
I mean that it defines exactly what value to use in the outline.

This:

   &lt;h1&gt;The Reality Dysfunction; Space is not the only void&lt;/h1&gt;

...would result in an outline that had the following title:

   &quot;The Reality Dysfunction; Space is not the only void&quot;

However, this:

   &lt;hgroup&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;The Reality Dysfunction&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Space is not the only void&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;/hgroup&gt;

...results in an outline with just:

   &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot;

...as desired. (A user agent could also include the subtitle, but it isn't 
required.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I still think that &lt;subtitle&gt; (subheader, tagline) would be just as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; effective, less confusing and less likely to break outline when used 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; improperly...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How is &lt;h2&gt; confusing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h2&gt; alone isn't. &lt;hgroup&gt; is the source of confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Difference between &lt;hgroup&gt; and &lt;header&gt; is not obvious. It wasn't to me
</I>&gt;<i> when I first saw them, and this isn't first thread about them.
</I>
Sure, but people get it pretty quickly. Most of the threads are along the 
lines of &quot;I don't like it&quot;, not &quot;It does X&quot; where X is wrong.


&gt;<i> * Makes meaning of &lt;hx&gt; overloaded (sometimes it's a header that affects 
</I>&gt;<i> outline and level or other headers, sometimes it's a subheader that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't do anything that header would).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you seen this post? 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.onderhond.com/blog/work/the-hgroup-tag">http://www.onderhond.com/blog/work/the-hgroup-tag</A> I think it sums up 
</I>&gt;<i> problems quite well.
</I>
If those are the problems, then I think we're doing pretty well. There 
were a couple of misunderstandings quickly addressed by the comments. As 
far as I can tell, the other concerns were all theoretical, such as not 
approving of the element taking its meaning from its parents. However, 
this is a pattern used all over HTML5, and I don't see why it's a problem.


&gt;<i> &gt; I think something like &lt;subtitle&gt; is just as likely to be misused as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;hgroup&gt;, to be honest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but it's much more fail-safe. If you use &lt;header&gt; instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt; or fail to use &lt;hgroup&gt;, you may significantly change structure 
</I>&gt;<i> of the document.
</I>
That's clearly not the end of the world, since people are doing it all the 
time today!


&gt;<i> You can't make much damage with &lt;subheader&gt;. Sections will remain 
</I>&gt;<i> correct and at worst you'll add wrong subtitles to headers.
</I>
There's plenty of damage you could make. What if someone decides that 
&lt;header&gt; should be &lt;subheader&gt; because it's in a section, and they end up 
putting entire sections in there, for instance? Authors have an unlimited 
capacity for misusing HTML.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, it has a much poorer legacy (backwards compatibility) story.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both solutions have problems. I don't think ones are much worse than the 
</I>&gt;<i> others.
</I>
I think &lt;subheader&gt; has far bigger problems than &lt;hgroup&gt; (primarily its 
lack of default styles in legacy UAs).


&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt; breaks the outline
</I>
I still think this is incorrect. It fixes the outline in new UAs, and has 
no effect on legacy UAs.


&gt;<i> &lt;subheader&gt; is ignored. Without CSS &lt;h2&gt;s will be too large and have too 
</I>&gt;<i> big margins.
</I>
The CSS is already there, though, since people are already using &lt;h2&gt; for 
this.


&gt;<i> With CSS &lt;subheader&gt; will work fine and doesn't limit styling 
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities. &lt;hgroup&gt;'s content model doesn't allow any non-header 
</I>&gt;<i> elements, so one can't add any extra hooks for styling:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;h1/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;div&gt;&lt;!-- add fancy border around subheaders? --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;h2/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;h2/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/hgroup&gt;
</I>
That's a good point. However, in general, I would encourage people to not 
insert HTML &lt;div&gt;s purely for styling; instead, in the future, XBL and CSS 
will hopefully provide the tools to address this. (We can always allow 
&lt;div&gt; later if this becomes a real problem.)


&gt;<i> Another thing - can you write XPath query that extracts all headers from 
</I>&gt;<i> the document? Without &lt;hgroup&gt; it's simple. With &lt;hgroup&gt; I'm not sure 
</I>&gt;<i> if I could manage to write correct query.
</I>
This problem exists in general in HTML -- can you write an XPath that 
selects the elements on a per-section basis, say? Or that selects all the 
third-level headers, including the right &lt;h1&gt;s in &lt;section&gt;s?

For that kind of thing we'll need pesudo-elements (in Selectors) or custom 
functions (in XPath).
