</I>
Very well, perhaps I am overcomplicating things a bit. I'll try to be a bit less stringent in my mark-up (I guess I am trying to be too much of a perfectionist sometimes)

&gt;<i> As well, it's
</I>&gt;<i> not really expected that most authors will read the spec, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> that they'll read tutorials and examples on the web, which can go more
</I>&gt;<i> in depth about particular types of layouts.
</I>
Call me silly, but I like to get my information from the source. I always have a copy of the HTML4 and CSS2 specs next to my keyboard in case I need it. Only if those specs are unclear to me do I start looking elsewhere. (even though I have been making websites for more than 10 years no, I still make mistakes and can't be expected to remember everything)

I am still having problems accepting the differences between &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; though. I understand when to use one over the other, but what was the background for choosing two elements instead of one? What is the drawback of defining just one in the spec (either &lt;section&gt; or &lt;article&gt;) and giving that one all the use cases and abilities of the two? I don't see how that would affect anything (not even AT).

Evert
