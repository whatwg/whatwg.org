It doesn't say that because if you remove the element, you implicitly also 
remove all its children (the children are part of the element in the DOM).

Other than that, the conclusions above are correct. If there's another way 
of saying what the spec says that is technically precise but more 
understandable, I'd be happy to use it. In the meantime, I've added an 
example to explain it better.
