</I>&gt;<i> I believe you can test if a key is in the storage area using:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   if (key in storage) { ... }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   if ('document' in window.localStorage) { ... }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I didn't find that in the spec anywhere. Is it somehow implicit and I just
missed it? Or will it be specified sometime in the future?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And since I just subscribed to the mailing list, I was wondering if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whole workers/localStorage discussion ended or not, as I can provide a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (potentially minor) real-world use-case for sharing access between the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page and worker if people want to hear it (in a new email of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think everyone agrees that we need a storage mechanism in workers; the
</I>&gt;<i> question is what it should be. That's basically the same as the question
</I>&gt;<i> of what should happen with the Web Database spec -- I don't think we would
</I>&gt;<i> want to end up with multiple storage systems in workers. The answer to
</I>&gt;<i> this question depends on the result of this debate in the Web Apps WG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Since I am not a w3c member and thus cannot subscribe to the Web Apps WG
mailing list, just want to say good luck to whomever pushes this. I truly
hope you guys can agree on a single storage solution that the browsers all
implement. It would definitely help keep my PhD thesis relevant after it's
finished. =)
