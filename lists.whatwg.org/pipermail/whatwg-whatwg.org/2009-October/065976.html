I've removed the 'source' attribute.

I haven't added this currently, but we may add this in the future if it 
turns out to be useful.

The spec is completely explicit about what it should be set to -- it says:

# the event must have its url attribute set to the address of the document 
# whose Storage object was affected
 -- <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#event-storage">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#event-storage</A>

...where &quot;the address of the document&quot; is defined as being the same as the 
value returned by document.URL (which is different than the value returned 
by location.href -- that's &quot;the document's current address&quot;). If you 
follow the hyperlinks from the link above, and click on the bold &lt;dfn&gt; 
text to find where the terms are used, you should find it to be 
unambiguous.

I assume that is a mistake. Does anyone support documentURI? It seems 
completely redundant with document.URL.
