Except for resizing, anything you can do with framesets, you can do better 
with &lt;iframe&gt;s and CSS. In addition, with pushState(), you can fix the 
bookmarking problem in a better way than with framesets.

Resizing is something that's harder to do, but that's a presentational 
issue that we need to fix anyway, independent of frames.

Framesets have a number of problems, chief amongst them that bookmarking 
is dysfunctional, but also that the accessibility story for frames is 
rather poor, and that there the presentation with frames is much less 
pleasing than with other features (e.g. in Safari, this page:

   <A HREF="http://www.artfulsoftware.com/infotree/mysqlquerytree.php">http://www.artfulsoftware.com/infotree/mysqlquerytree.php</A>

...has a vertical scrollbar for the top frame -- a problem you wouldn't 
get if instead of four pages, you had three, with the main one containing 
two iframes from the left and right frames).

In addition to &lt;iframe&gt;s, other techniques exist to get similar results, 
e.g. AJAX. The use case covered by &lt;frameset&gt; is definitely handled 

(Getting rid of the frames altogether is probably best, since then tools 
like search engines can actually return useful links. However, I 
understand if some authors are unwilling to do the work to get to that 
point. &lt;iframes&gt;, on the other hand, are very easy to migrate to.)

This isn't the W3C.

Actually, you only need to use frames in the frameset page, so if your 
only concern is what validates, you could just use HTML4 Frameset for the 
frameset page, and HTML5 for the content pages.

But I would still strongly discourage using framesets.

Indeed.

That's how we roll here. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> If your premiss is correct, backward compatibility.
</I>
Backwards-compatibility is preserved: HTML5 defines how framesets are to 
be implemented, so your pages won't stop working with HTML5 browsers. They 
just won't be conforming HTML5, because we want to discourage the use of 
framesets in favour of better solutions.

</I>
It would be a bad idea to relegate a perfectly sound use case to a 
cul-de-sac. But that's not what we're doing. The use case is still 
handled fine, in a number of ways (e.g. &lt;iframe&gt;s, Ajax-based navigation). 
The feature we're relegating to a cul-de-sac is not perfectly sound.

Framesets actually do conflict significantly with what most users expect; 
that's one of their problems.


&gt;<i> Framesets are part of the current HTML standard and should remain.
</I>
Actually framesets were deprecated in 1998. They've been on the chopping 
block for over ten years now. Their use is _so_ discouraged in HTML4 that 
they are not even included in the Transitional DTD, they are relagated to 
their own third-tier DTD.

</I>
I believe Andrew's statement to be incorrect. I would argue that the 
usability of help sites based on &lt;frameset&gt;s is horrible. For example, 
search engines can't index into them (search is a critical part of help 
systems), pages in them can't easily be bookmarked and URLs to them can't 
be shared with other people (another critical part of help systems), and 
using the &quot;open in new tab&quot; feature on index pages of help systems that 
use framesets ends up breaking the frameset, making browsing multiple 
aspects in parallel difficult.

Tabs are a media-specific presentation issue, and don't belong in HTML.

Tree menu navigation is a use case we need to fix anyway, and will 
probably do so in the next version of HTML. (We were going to do it in 
HTML5, but had to punt because we couldn't get the detailed nailed down. 
It's a hard thing to get right.) However, that's independant of frames. 
The problem exists regardless of what the look is, one frame or many.
