<PRE>Aryeh,

 &gt;I don't see why that's beneficial.

It's not your brief to decide what's beneficial for a client.

 &gt;It conflicts with expected
 &gt;behavior.

It does not conflict with what these users expect.

 &gt; If you follow a link and then click &quot;back&quot;, your
 &gt;link-following should be undone. You shouldn't be taken to a totally
 &gt;different page that you left half an hour ago.

You are arguing for imposing one way of doing things. Ugh.

 &gt;That's not how the W3C or the WHATWG or any standards bodies operate.
 &gt;If you want a feature in HTML5, you have to argue that it would help
 &gt;the web to support it, not just that some authors want it.

Framesets are part of the current HTML standard and should remain.

PB
