It's not just a matter of degree. If the UA follows the spec, authors can
(fairly easily) write code that's race free. Darin's proposing to make it so
they can't --- at least, not without external help like shared workers or
Web Storage, in which case I wonder why one would use LocalStorage at all.
(OK, I suppose one could rely on key/value atomicity and implement Lamport's
bakery algorithm on LocalStorage alone. I hope to never see that...)

That is a good point. You do have the option of doing better than IE, though
