This is now reflected on item.itemScope.


&gt;<i> Also, the 'contents' DOM-property is always the item-property value

</I>&gt;<i> valueType DOM-property which could be 'string', 'item' or something 
</I>&gt;<i> similar.
</I>
Interesting idea. I've renamed 'content' to 'itemValue', and made it 
return null if there's no itemprop=&quot;&quot;, and the element itself if there's 
an itemscope=&quot;&quot;.


&gt;<i> One example [5] uses document.items[item].names but document.items isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> defined anywhere. I assume this is an oversight and that it is 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to document.getItems() Further, names is a member of 
</I>&gt;<i> HTMLPropertyCollection, so document.items[item].properties.names is 
</I>&gt;<i> probably intended instead of document.items[item].names. Assuming this 
</I>&gt;<i> the example actually produces the output it claims to.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> Shouldn't namedItem [6] be namedItems? Code like .namedItem().item(0) 
</I>&gt;<i> would be quite confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> [6] <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#dom-htmlpropertycollection-nameditem">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#dom-htmlpropertycollection-nameditem</A>
</I>
I don't understand what this is referring to.


&gt;<i> Also, RadioNodeList should be PropertyNodeList.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> I think many will wonder why item and itemprop can't be given on a 
</I>&gt;<i> single element for compactness:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span item=&quot;org.example.fruit&quot; itemprop=&quot;org.example.name&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;s and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span item=&quot;org.example.fruit&quot; itemprop=&quot;org.example.name&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;s
</I>&gt;<i> don't compare well.
</I>
Modulo the changes to the syntax (s/item=/itemscope itemtype=/g), this is 
allowed -- but it means the same as this:

   &lt;span itemprop=&quot;org.example.name&quot; itemscope itemtype=&quot;org.example.fruit&quot;&gt;...

...which is to say, it's giving a property whose value is itself an item.

I considered testing this, as well as RDFa, but due to time constraints we 
ended up only being able to test a few changes, so I concentrated 
specifically on microdata variants.

That would preclude being able to make trees.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Given that flat items like vcard/vevent are likely to be the most

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be created by using a predefined item property: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; itemprop=&quot;com.example.childtype item&quot;. The value of that property 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would then be the first item in tree-order (or all items in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; subtree, not sure). This way, items would have better copy-paste 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; resilience as the whole item element could be made into a top-level 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; item simply by moving it, without meddling with the itemprop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That sounds kinda confusing...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More confusing than item+itemprop on the same element? In many cases the 
</I>&gt;<i> property value is the contained text, having it be the contained item 
</I>&gt;<i> node(s) doesn't seem much stranger.
</I>
Based on the studies Google did, I'm not convinced that people will find 
the nesting that complicated. IMHO the proposal above is more confusing, 
too. I'm not sure this is solving a problem that needs solving.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If the parent-item (com.example.blog) doesn't know what the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; child-items are, it would simply use itemprop=&quot;item&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand this at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This was an attempt to have anonymous sub-items. Re-thinking this, 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a better solution would be to have each item behave in much the 
</I>&gt;<i> same way that the document itself does. That is, simply add items in the 
</I>&gt;<i> subtree without using itemprop and access them with .getItems(itemType) 
</I>&gt;<i> on the outer item.
</I>
How would you do things like &quot;agent&quot; in the vEvent vocabulary?


&gt;<i> Comparing the current model with a DOM tree, it seems odd in that a 
</I>&gt;<i> property could be an item. It would be like an element attribute being 
</I>&gt;<i> another element: &lt;outer foo=&quot;&lt;inner/&gt;&quot;/&gt;. That kind of thing could just 
</I>&gt;<i> as well be &lt;outer&gt;&lt;foo&gt;&lt;inner/&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;&lt;/outer&gt;, &lt;outer&gt;&lt;inner 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;foo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/outer&gt; or even &lt;outer&gt;&lt;inner/&gt;&lt;/outer&gt; if the relationship 
</I>&gt;<i> between the elements is clear just from the fact that they have a 
</I>&gt;<i> parent-child relationship (usually the case).
</I>
Microdata's datamodel is more similar to JSON's than XML's.


&gt;<i> It's only in the case where both itemprop and item have a type that an 
</I>&gt;<i> extra level of nesting will be needed and I expect that to be the 
</I>&gt;<i> exception. Changing the model to something more DOM-tree-like is 
</I>&gt;<i> probably going to be easier to understand for many web developers.
</I>
I dunno. People didn't seem to have much trouble getting it once we used 
itemscope=&quot;&quot; rather than just item=&quot;&quot;. People understand the JSON 
datamodel pretty well, why would this be different?

Thanks for this suggestion.

We tried this (it was variant 3). In practice, it didn't seem to lead to 
any significant improvement of understanding in the participants; people 
understood (to my surprise!) the difference between the concept of &quot;type&quot; 
and the concept of &quot;name&quot;, and actually in several cases started trying to 
provide a type even when the examples didn't call for it.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your response. After reviewing the info on microdata, I

</I>
I encourage any interested in this to write a vocabulary spec. There are 
some samples you can use to make new vocabularies:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/vocabs/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/vocabs/current-work/</A>


&gt;<i> In my understanding, microdata certainly seems like a sufficient way to 
</I>&gt;<i> handle bibliography entries--once again, hoping that a standardized 
</I>&gt;<i> vocabulary develops. The scheme I discussed about introducing a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'bibliography' element and reusing the 'dt' and 'dd' elements within, I 
</I>&gt;<i> simply felt was consistent with the introduction of other new HTML5 
</I>&gt;<i> elements describing the pieces of a virtual document (e.g., article, 
</I>&gt;<i> section, figure, aside, etc.).  Additionally, the scheme consistently 
</I>&gt;<i> reused the elements 'dt' and 'dd' in the 'bibliography' context just as 
</I>&gt;<i> they are reused in the new 'figure' and 'details' context.  Although, I 
</I>&gt;<i> have to admit I'm not sure I'm a fan of this element overloading as 
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to introducing explicit tags to cover these concepts when 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate.  But I do understand that HTML5 is constrained by legacy 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML and also that microdata is another way to work around these 
</I>&gt;<i> constraints.
</I>
I think for bibliography data, we're going to need much more detail than 
we can really get just with a section and dt/dd.


&gt;<i> I'm not arguing that microdata isn't the best approach here; but it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be considered that first class elements are more legible than 
</I>&gt;<i> microdata. And I'm sure this is why many of the new HTML5 elements are 
</I>&gt;<i> not implemented as microdata.
</I>
Most of the new elements are more intended to make styling easier than to 
get data out of the page. The use cases intended to get data out of the 
page -- contact information, events, work licensing -- all use Microdata.
