</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, so possible revision: &lt;base onlyreplace=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; carries a list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ids to replace. &#160;This automatically makes all links and forms on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page carry the onlyreplace semantics. &#160;You can turn this off for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific links by setting @noreplace (a binary attribute) on the link
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or form; activating/submitting them will trigger a normal navigation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;all links and forms&quot; do you really mean &quot;all same-domain links and
</I>&gt;<i> forms&quot;?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Even that's too many. &#160;Consider a typical site with a forum
</I>&gt;<i> at /forum and a wiki at /wiki. &#160;You don't want links from one to the
</I>&gt;<i> other to try onlyreplacing. &#160;Even within an app it can be complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;MediaWiki is often installed in both /w (actual files) and /wiki
</I>&gt;<i> (fake rewrite path), and you'd probably want links to everything in
</I>&gt;<i> /wiki but only some things in /w to be affected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps &lt;a onlyreplace&gt; should be a boolean attribute. &#160;Opting links
</I>&gt;<i> into onlyreplace seems safer than opting them out. &#160;In many cases you
</I>&gt;<i> might be injecting some raw HTML into the page, like using a template
</I>&gt;<i> system or JavaScript, such that adding noreplace to all links you're
</I>&gt;<i> unsure about would be tricky or impossible. &#160;Opt-in is much easier to
</I>&gt;<i> verify.
</I>
I think the opposite.  If I upgraded my site to this, I'd want nearly
all the links to onlyreplace.  There's only a handful of same-origin
links that I'd instead want to trigger a full load.

&gt;<i> In any event, this variant is fairly disastrous for copy-pasting.
</I>&gt;<i> What you thought meant &quot;load only foo and bar from the target&quot; might
</I>&gt;<i> suddenly mean &quot;load only baz and quuz from the target&quot;, and the result
</I>&gt;<i> will probably be that the link completely fails. &#160;I think sticking
</I>&gt;<i> only to per-&lt;a&gt; attributes is a safer idea, one way or another.
</I>
It's true that this could be bad on copypasta, but is your failure
scenario going to be common?  Are people going to often use different
&lt;base&gt;s on different pages in the same origin?  I think more usually a
single origin will have the same &lt;base onlyreplace&gt; everywhere, or
else not have &lt;base onlyreplace&gt; at all.  In the latter case, you'd
presumably want all links to trigger full navigation, since that's
what you're indicating with the lack.

(Also, the same problem you note happens similarly with per-&lt;a&gt;
onlyreplace - what if you copy a link from one page to another, and
the new page has *different* elements with the same #ids as elements
in the old page?  Then you'd be replacing random bits of the page.  Is
this situation more/less likely than the one you brought up?)

&gt;<i> Also, I anticipate that on many pages that would like to use this
</I>&gt;<i> feature, only some unpredictable minority of links would actually need
</I>&gt;<i> it. &#160;I don't think there will be any way to identify which ones
</I>&gt;<i> without some kind of case-by-case human intervention, so I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;base&gt; would be terribly useful.
</I>
I disagree, and think that most links would use it on a typical page.

&gt;<i> Some attention needs to be given to error handling. &#160;What happens if
</I>&gt;<i> one or more of the requested id's aren't found? &#160;Do they silently
</I>&gt;<i> fail? &#160;If so, this could result in the link doing absolutely nothing
</I>&gt;<i> in hard-to-control situations -- like an error page that occurs
</I>&gt;<i> sporadically, say a 500. &#160;Do they trigger a normal page load? &#160;If so,
</I>&gt;<i> they have to wait until the entire page has loaded, which would be bad
</I>&gt;<i> user experience but hard to track down -- a long, inexplicable delay
</I>&gt;<i> followed by everything working normally. &#160;This could be mitigated by
</I>&gt;<i> having an HTTP header to say &quot;that id doesn't exist, load the whole
</I>&gt;<i> page instead&quot;, but it would fail in the default case (standard HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> server unaware of new feature).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what happens if some of the given id's are present, but not others?
</I>
I'll think a bit about these issues today.  I'm not sure, off the top
of my head, what the best response is.

&gt;<i> One final observation is that this method isn't ideal for fixing
</I>&gt;<i> flickering, because often you'll want to change everything at once --
</I>&gt;<i> you just don't want it to flicker. &#160;For instance, consider a case
</I>&gt;<i> where you have a navigation pane and a content pane. &#160;Changing pages
</I>&gt;<i> will change the content pane, but also sometimes cause a different
</I>&gt;<i> item to be highlighted in the navigation pane, or cause some
</I>&gt;<i> contextual items to disappear and reappear, etc. &#160;However, a solution
</I>&gt;<i> to that has all the advantages of the onlyreplace proposal, that's
</I>&gt;<i> simple to describe using existing functionality, and works well with
</I>&gt;<i> URLs, but doesn't kill all script handlers and such, seems hard.
</I>
You'd just hook the links with javascript and use that to change the
navigation-pane highlight.  (Or, in some cases, harness CSS, such as
by using the proposed pseudoclass that matches links to the current
document.)
