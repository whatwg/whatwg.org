<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Ian Hickson 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C) When talking about outline (in the context of sectioning) I gather
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are NOT talking about the DOM-tree, but about (a Table Of) Contents
</I>&gt;<i> kind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of outline.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does a generic page-header and footer (containing a site-wide logo,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; style and navigation) belong in such an outline? If not, does this
</I>&gt;<i> mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it has to be enclosed in a separate SECTION element? Nothing about
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is made clear either in wording or examples.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why this is a question. Why would it not belong in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> outline?
</I>
Because of the fact the outline is a sort of TOC, and sometimes stuff that goes in a &lt;header&gt; doesn't belong in a TOC (since it is not content in the strictest sense of the word). But I think Tab Atkins answered this by giving me the advice not to over-think this too much. And he is probably right.


&gt;<i> &gt; The spec is not very clear anywhere about styling practices (I know
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is CSS' job, but within HTML the mark-up should at least be
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on what you had in mind? Note that default styles
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> listed in detail in their own section.
</I>
I know, but that was not what I had in mind. I wish there were some examples that showed the difference in mark-ups between using &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt; etc. and &lt;div&gt;. Again, maybe I am trying too much here, but let me explain:

When starting a job you get content from the client (well, hopefully ;-) You start out by categorizing and sorting this content; this process can be an actual job you do, or something you do &quot;subconsciously&quot; while working at the site. In an ideal situation, it is easy to sort the content in two categories: content that belongs in the outline and pure lay-out. But sometimes this choice is not so black and white. In those cases, one designer may use a &lt;div&gt; while another may use a &lt;section&gt; or an &lt;aside&gt;. 
Now I am not saying the spec should educate on this (as it has been mentioned, this is a job for tutorial sites etc.), but what I am saying is that it may be prudent to use more complex examples in the spec that address the difference in when to use &lt;section&gt; etc. and when to use &lt;div&gt; to make the line less gray.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please file specific bugs or send specific e-mails for each example you
</I>&gt;<i> think should be reworked; there are over 300 examples in the spec and
</I>&gt;<i> without knowing what is wrong with each one, if I just go through them
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> and change them, they're just going to go from one kind of bad example
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> another kind of bad example.
</I>
I'd be perfectly happy to provide you with some examples, but I hope you will give me some helpfull feedback if I make a mistake in them. I will rework the examples for sectioning elements. Is a time-frame of two weeks ok with you?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps a small example, currently I am working on a site where
</I>&gt;<i> content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is generally regarded as a header, is placed as a sidebar on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lower right of the page. It only contains a logo and a slideshow. Is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this a &lt;header&gt; or is this a &lt;div&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you provide the URI? I would be happy to take a look, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> base
</I>&gt;<i> an example in the spec on this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As I am still working in the site it is local, so no URI. Also I am somewhat uncomfortable with sending you the source-code as it is rather messy right now (I had to rework the site as the client had some new ideas he wanted to try out).
I will try to include this code in the examples I will send.

Thanks for your answers,
Evert
