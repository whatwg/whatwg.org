</I>&gt;<i> think to follow the spec we'd need to pin the entire resource 
</I>&gt;<i> permanently in the cache after we reached NETWORK_LOADED, which could be 
</I>&gt;<i> highly suboptimal in some situations.
</I>
Step 2 says &quot;While the user agent might still need network access to 
obtain parts of the media resource, the user agent must remain on this 
step&quot;. It even has an example of a UA that discards video data.


&gt;<i> Another issue is that it's not completely clear to me what is meant by 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;While the user agent might still need network access to obtain parts of 
</I>&gt;<i> the media resource&quot; What if there is data in the resource that we don't 
</I>&gt;<i> need in order to play through normally, but which might be needed in 
</I>&gt;<i> some special situations (e.g., enabling subtitles, or seeking using an 
</I>&gt;<i> index), and we optimize to not load that data unless/until we need it? 
</I>&gt;<i> In that case would we never reach NETWORK_LOADED?
</I>
Correct.


&gt;<i> In general NETWORK_LOADED and the &quot;load&quot; event seem rather useless and 
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous IMHO. If you're playing a resource that doesn't fit in your 
</I>&gt;<i> cache then you'll certainly never reach NETWORK_LOADED, and since 
</I>&gt;<i> authors can't know the cache size they can never rely on &quot;load&quot; firing. 
</I>&gt;<i> And if you allow the cache discarding behavior I described above, 
</I>&gt;<i> authors can't rely on data actually being present locally even after 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;load&quot; has fired. I suspect many authors will make invalid assumptions 
</I>&gt;<i> about &quot;load&quot; being sure to fire and about what &quot;load&quot; means if it does 
</I>&gt;<i> fire. Does anyone have any use cases that &quot;load&quot; actually solves?
</I>
I'm happy to remove 'load'. It's mostly a holdover from the first cut at 
this API, where this wasn't thought through in much detail.

Done.

NOTE: I've changed NETWORK_NO_SOURCE's value from 4 to 3!

I've left it in the other cases, since, well, Progress Events says to. But 
I'd be happy to drop loadend in all cases (including other Progress Events 
cases) if that makes sense.

Ok, I've switched them back to regular Event events, though using the same 
event names.
