</I>&gt;<i> ASCII-compatibility:
</I>&gt;<i> The note in &#145;2.1.5 Character encodings&#146; seems to say that &#145;variants of
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-2022&#146; (presumably including common ones like ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022KR and
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-2022-JP) are ASCII-compatible, whereas HZ-GB-2312 is not, and I cannot

</I>
HZ-GB-2312 uses the byte ASCII uses for &quot;~&quot; as the escape character. 
ISO-2022-* uses the control codes. That's the difference.


&gt;<i> Discouraged encodings:
</I>&gt;<i> &#145;4.2.5.5 Specifying the document's character encoding&#146; advises against
</I>&gt;<i> certain encodings. In particular:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Authors should not use JIS-X-0208 (JIS_C6226-1983), JIS-X-0212
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (JIS_X0212-1990), encodings based on ISO-2022, and encodings based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; EBCDIC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not clear what this means (e.g., the character set JIS_C6226-1983 in
</I>&gt;<i> any encoding, or only when encoded alone according to RFC1345 as described
</I>&gt;<i> above); 
</I>
This is talking about character encodings, not character sets. 
&quot;JIS_C6226-1983&quot; is a registered character encoding in the IANA registry.


&gt;<i> the list of discouraged encodings seems conspicuously short if it is 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be complete; and the lack of rationale makes it difficult to 
</I>&gt;<i> understand why these encodings are considered particularly harmful 
</I>&gt;<i> (JIS_C6226-1983 v. JIS_C6226-1978 or ISO-2022 v. HZ, to mention but two 
</I>&gt;<i> at least initially puzzling cases).
</I>
The reason for including these is to discourage encodings known to have 
security issues. I've added HZ-GB-2312, which can be used in a similarly 
dangerous fashion. (Basically the danger for user agents is in an attacker 
using an encoding that a user agent could autodetect, while a site 
interprets the bytes safely; that would allow those encodings to be used 
to smuggle &lt;script&gt; elements in a way that a naive whitelisting filter 
would think is safe.)


&gt;<i> It might be better to say *why* particular encodings are better avoided, 
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not the list of discouraged encodings be presented as 
</I>&gt;<i> definitive.
</I>
I've added a note.


&gt;<i> (Incidentally, this advice probably deserves not to be &#145;hidden&#146; in a 
</I>&gt;<i> section nominally reserved for character encoding *declaration* issues.)
</I>
Yeah. I considered moving it to the Writing HTML documents section, but 
that one doesn't apply to conformance checkers, so it ends up being more 
of a pain, since the advice would have to be split into multiple pieces so 
that it applied appropriately. It's not a big deal.


&gt;<i> Minor grammar detail in 4.2.5.5:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Conformance checkers may advise against authors using legacy encodings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is ambiguous.  It should probably be &#145;advise against authors&#146; using
</I>&gt;<i> legacy encodings&#146;  or better &#145;advise authors against using legacy
</I>&gt;<i> encodings&#146;.
</I>
Fixed.

The exact string isn't there, that's why I included the preferred MIME

You can use non-ASCII-compatible encodings (e.g. UTF-16).

Hopefully this is clear now.

Good luck with that. It's much-needed work.

Indeed.

Hopefully this is somewhat addressed now.
