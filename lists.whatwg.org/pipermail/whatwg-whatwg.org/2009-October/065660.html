<PRE>Here is a good example of the conflict between Google and Mozilla over 
clip():
<A HREF="http://www.imperialviolet.org/2009/09/02/anti-aliased-clipping.html">http://www.imperialviolet.org/2009/09/02/anti-aliased-clipping.html</A>

There is another conflict, with the composition modes between the two, 
with Google
again taking another principled stand. I'm sorry I don't supporting 
links for that,
but it effects many of the composite operations (at least four of them).

I'm hoping to have both methods supported, I think they are both valuable.
I've certainly used both methods in my work the past few years.

This is very much about the clipping pipeline.
