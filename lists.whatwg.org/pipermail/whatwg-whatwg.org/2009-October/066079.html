discussed below)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connections), so that sites that use Basic auth, like, say, porn 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sites, or the W3C, can also use it for their Web Socket connections. I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could just limit it that way; would that work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Formally limiting support for Basic auth would be workable, I guess. 
</I>&gt;<i> Implementation of Digest authentication is already non-trivial enough

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or perhaps authentication should be limited to cookies in v1 indeed.
</I>
Ok, I've removed the authentication stuff from this version.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If /code/, interpreted as ASCII, is &quot;401&quot;, then let /mode/ be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; _authenticate_. Otherwise, fail the Web Socket connection and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abort these steps.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 407 (proxy authenticate) also likely needs to be supported.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Proxies wouldn't work with WebSockets in general.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Could you please elaborate? I thought there was a setup that could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; work with most deployed HTTPS proxies - one could run WebSockets 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; server on port 443.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, I see what you're saying. Proxy authentication of this nature is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covered by step 2 of the handshake algorithm, as part of &quot;connect to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that proxy and ask it to open a TCP/IP connection to the host given by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /host/ and the port given by /port/&quot;. There's even an example showing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; auth headers being sent to the proxy. By the time we get down to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parsing the response, we're long past the point where we might be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authenticating to a proxy. Is that a problem?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I actually don't know for sure. Step 2 only covers the case when 
</I>&gt;<i> the user agent is configured to use a proxy - but an organization may 
</I>&gt;<i> have a transparent proxy intercepting requests. But I do not know if 
</I>&gt;<i> such a proxy can practically request authentication by returning a 407 
</I>&gt;<i> response (blurring the meaning of &quot;transparent&quot; a bit, but anyway).
</I>
I don't see how such a proxy could handle WebSocket anyway. The WebSocket 
protocol isn't really intended to be proxied.


&gt;<i> &gt; I could add support for 407 here and just say that you jump back to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; step 2 and include the authentication this time, would that work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the answer to my above concern is yes, then it should work, as long 
</I>&gt;<i> as the text doesn't require double TLS handshake or something like that.
</I>
I've added text in the spec that says to handle 407 basically like HTTP, 
closing the connection and jumping back to step 2.


&gt;<i> &gt; Or do you mean that you would rather have authentication be a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first-class primitive operation in Web Socket, instead of relying on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the HTTP features? We could do that: instead of faking an HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication, we could have a header in the handshake that means 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;after this, the client must send one more handshake consisting of an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authentication token&quot;, and if the UA fails to send the right extra 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit, then fail. I think if we did this, we'd want to punt until 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version 2, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think that relying on HTTP specs to define authentication to Web 
</I>&gt;<i> Sockets takes the &quot;fake HTTP handshake&quot; concept too far.
</I>
Ok. We'll revisit this in the next version, I guess.

I'm not sure there's really much point doing anything beyond cookie auth 
anyway.
