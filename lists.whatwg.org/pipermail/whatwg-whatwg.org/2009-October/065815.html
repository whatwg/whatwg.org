There are at least four examples in the spec that show &lt;div&gt; and &lt;article&gt; 
or &lt;section&gt; used together.

I'm happy to add more, if you have any specific requests.


&gt;<i> When starting a job you get content from the client (well, hopefully ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> content in two categories: content that belongs in the outline and pure 
</I>&gt;<i> lay-out. But sometimes this choice is not so black and white. In those 
</I>&gt;<i> cases, one designer may use a &lt;div&gt; while another may use a &lt;section&gt; or 
</I>&gt;<i> an &lt;aside&gt;. Now I am not saying the spec should educate on this (as it 
</I>&gt;<i> has been mentioned, this is a job for tutorial sites etc.), but what I 
</I>&gt;<i> am saying is that it may be prudent to use more complex examples in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec that address the difference in when to use &lt;section&gt; etc. and when 
</I>&gt;<i> to use &lt;div&gt; to make the line less gray.
</I>
If you have any concrete examples I could include, I'd be happy to do so. 
I'm probably not the best person to be writing such examples, though.


&gt;<i> &gt; Please file specific bugs or send specific e-mails for each example 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you think should be reworked; there are over 300 examples in the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and without knowing what is wrong with each one, if I just go through 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them all and change them, they're just going to go from one kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad example to another kind of bad example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be perfectly happy to provide you with some examples, but I hope you

</I>&gt;<i> weeks ok with you?
</I>
Rather than reworking examples, let's just add more. :-)

Any time frame is fine; I'll add them whenever they are available.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The page has a header and a footer which we will disregard for the sake 
</I>&gt;<i> of this example. Between this header and footer we have:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div id=&quot;detail&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;img src=&quot;example1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example1_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example2_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example3_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;example4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example4_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in essence, we are talking about a portfolio (with some AJAX in the 
</I>&gt;<i> background which we will ignore). Clicking on a thumbnail in the &lt;ul&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> will show the detailed picture inside the &lt;div&gt;. I left out arguments 
</I>&gt;<i> which have no bearing on the discussion. Depending on your point of view 
</I>&gt;<i> one will or will not call this an application, so in itself it is a good 
</I>&gt;<i> example of ambiguous content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How should this be redone in HTML5?
</I>
The code above seems fine, though I probably wouldn't bother with the 
&lt;div&gt; (either using a &lt;p&gt; or nothing at all, depending on what else is 
there). You could also use an &lt;iframe&gt; instead of the &lt;img&gt; in the 
&quot;detail&quot; div, so that you don't need JS. And of course there's a bunch of 
missing alt=&quot;&quot; attributes that are required in HTML5 (and 4).


&gt;<i> I come across the following questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Should this entire code be wrapped in a &lt;section&gt;? The argument for 
</I>&gt;<i> it being that this entire portfolio should show up in the outline as a 
</I>&gt;<i> whole. The argument against it being that since it is the only content 
</I>&gt;<i> on the page no &lt;section&gt; is needed and that it is conceivable that in 
</I>&gt;<i> the future extra content could be added in between the &lt;div&gt; and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;ul&gt; which is not related to either.
</I>
It maybe could have a section, but I'd have to see the rest of the page to 
say for sure. Doesn't seem necessary though.


&gt;<i> 2) Should the &lt;div&gt; be replaced by &lt;section&gt;? The argument being that 
</I>&gt;<i> this detail-picture is actually the main content of the page and could 
</I>&gt;<i> also include extra information (like a textual description) in the 
</I>&gt;<i> future. The argument against is simply that the &lt;img&gt; is adequately 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic and the &lt;div&gt; is there only for lay-out/scripting.
</I>
I would probably remove the &lt;div&gt; altogether.


&gt;<i> 3) Should the &lt;ul&gt; be wrapped in an &lt;aside&gt;? Since it is definitely 
</I>&gt;<i> related to the detail-picture. But see also 5)
</I>
Unless it could be removed without significantly changing the meaning of 
the page (which seems unlikely here), I would say no.


&gt;<i> 4) Should the &lt;ul&gt; be replaced by a &lt;nav&gt;? Argument for it is that 
</I>&gt;<i> clicking on a thumbnail changes (part of) the page and is therefore not 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;true&quot; list of items but a form of navigation. The argument against is 
</I>&gt;<i> that it is highly debatable if this constitutes a real form of 
</I>&gt;<i> navigation.
</I>
It doesn't seem like a navigation menu to me.


&gt;<i> 5) Now stretching a bit, it is conceivable that someone may argue that 
</I>&gt;<i> the thumbnails are actually the main-content and that the detail-picture 
</I>&gt;<i> is nothing more than a detail of part of that content.
</I>
Neither makes sense without the other, so I'd be skeptical of that line of 
reasoning.

Document, app, it doesn't matter. There's a spectrum, and few things these 
days are at either end of the line. Is the HTML5 spec itself a document or 
an app? (It has plenty of scripting.) It doesn't matter.


&gt;<i> &lt;iframe src=&quot;example1_jpg.html&quot; name=&quot;detail&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div id=&quot;advert&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;detail&quot; href=&quot;example1_jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example1_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;detail&quot; href=&quot;example2_jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example2_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;detail&quot; href=&quot;example3_jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example3_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;detail&quot; href=&quot;example4_jpg.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;example4_thmb.jpg /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, this example works more or less the same as the other one, 
</I>&gt;<i> except this time there is no scripting, so could it technically still be 
</I>&gt;<i> called an application?
</I>
Sure, it's basically the same thing. In fact I suggested above that this 
might be the way to do it. :-)


&gt;<i> Secondly, it divides the detail-picture from the thumbnails with oodles 
</I>&gt;<i> of non related content.
</I>
I'd say that is poor UI, but apart from that it's neither here not there.


&gt;<i> Now, if this means the mark-up in this example should be different from 
</I>&gt;<i> the previous example --
</I>
It doesn't.

If you printed the page, would you say they were in different sections?

Indeed.

The header guideline is a reasonable one, though it should be noted that 
just because you _could_ put a header at the top of each section doesn't 
mean you necessarily _should_ or that you would want to.
