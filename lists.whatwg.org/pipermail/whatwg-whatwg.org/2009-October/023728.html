</I>
Well, as I explained, it's not really a MUST.  Doing an ordinary
navigation requests an entire page, and without optimizations this
does the exact same thing.  You're not burning *more* bandwidth than
normal; you're just slightly changing the effect of it.

That said, such optimizations would be really useful, I agree.  It
could significantly cut down bandwidth use (on my company's site, the
average request would drop from about 20k to about 1.5k).  This could
*really* improve site performance, and even perhaps be good for the
overall net.

&gt;<i> It seems the browser will need to make a distinction between a regular request and a request invoked by a bookmark.
</I>&gt;<i> In case of a bookmark the server should not strip content so the browser must let him know that.
</I>
There's no need to make a distinction.  Only requests with onlyreplace
semantics trigger the special behavior.  Typing an address into your
browser won't add those semantics, nor will a bookmark; only links
with @onlyreplace (or links on a page with &lt;base onlyreplace&gt; that
don't override their own @onlyreplace with the empty string) carry the
semantics.

If you're talking about this in terms of optimizations, then the
onlyreplace information would be carried by a request header.  When
the browser doesn't send this header, the server wouldn't strip
anything down.

&gt;<i> In a single page application AJAX updates can be originated in 2 roots:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The user clicks something in the navigation panel
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The user clicks an action button inside the content panel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An example of use case #2 can be clicking a &quot;save&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i> In this case the &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot; tag is usually not used but a button, this means that other tags the&#160; &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot; should have the &quot;onlyreplace&quot; attribute.
</I>
I thought it would be interesting to be able to put @onlyreplace on
forms, or perhaps form submission inputs.

&gt;<i> In this example the URL should not be remembered by the history.
</I>
Then you should use ordinary AJAX to do so.  @onlyreplace is supposed
to be merely an optimization on normal navigation.  The url *must* be
remembered by the history.

&gt;<i> There are other cases of use case #2 where the URL should be remembered - like a &quot;next&quot; button on a page-able data grid.
</I>
Yup, exactly.  A paged control is a great use-case!  It's extremely
simple to set up (just pass paging info in query params), and
bookmarking works beautifully!

&gt;<i> I think this solution is good for changes of the entire content panel.
</I>&gt;<i> When a specific widget needs to update a data binding solution may be better.
</I>
Yeah, this is not meant to be a general replacement for AJAX.  It just
makes a particular set of common cases extremely easy.  In many
circumstances being explicit with javascript is still the better
solution.

&gt;<i> This means the &quot;onlyreplace&quot; will probably be always the defaults.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean here.
