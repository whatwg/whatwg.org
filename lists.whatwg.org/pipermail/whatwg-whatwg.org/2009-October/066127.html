<PRE>G'day Gregory,

Thanks for the explanation. While I understand the issue you present  
with precedence of JS and fallback content, I can't off the top of my  
head come up with any necessary uses for the canPlayType function  
(maybe as a nice-to-have, of course) had the behaviour worked more  
predictably&#8212;particularly if the tradeoff is a totally non-workable  
solution in modern browsers with NoScript turned on in situations like  
mine. What happens if/when IE comes to the party but requires WMV  
output? Will we all then encode *three* of the same video just to get  
broader support? I can't see the complexity of that operation every  
trumping the ease of use (from a content producer's end) of a single  
FLV with a Flash video player, which is surely the ultimate goal here.

As far as the standards compliance etc. goes; the site is not client  
work, and isn't going to be deployed/marketed as a standard website  
(hence my taking a risk on using the HTML5 doctype at all).

The trade-offs for us to implement OGG&#8212;in this particular case, at  
least&#8212;just for the sake of idealism aren't worth the maintenance cost  
penalty we'd pay by providing (encoding, hosting, etc., etc.) two  
video formats; the site will explicitly target users we know to use IE  
for the most part, but should also work on the iPhone (the customer is  
ourselves). That made V4E a good fit and I was keen to experiment with  
the video element myself anyway.

I just found the behaviour of the element highly contrary to what I  
had expected and wanted to raise it as a concern.
