<PRE>Boris,

 &gt; use cases that the W3C wants to discourage ...

That W3C mindset promotes no greater good; it just imposes an idea of 
what use cases should and shouldn't specify. Might as wellwrite popuo 
removal into HTML5.

 &gt; The use cases can still be addressed with &lt;iframe&gt; and a bit of pain 
if resizing is desired, as far as I can tell. 

I quoted Andrew Fedoniouk 
(<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-March/010186.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-March/010186.html</A>), 
&quot;There are use cases when frames are good. As an example: online (and 
offline) help systems ...  In such cases they provide level of usability 
higher than any other method of presenting content of such type.&quot;

I've not seen a counterexample. Have you?

 &gt;So this is all about assuming that the bit of pain will be enough of 
an inconvenience
 &gt;for authors that they will either address the use case in some way not 
involving iframes
 &gt;at all (and which presumably has a lower pain threshild; what is this 
way?)

As above, no-one seems able to point to a non-frameset solution.

 &gt;or not address
 &gt;the use case at all (unlikely, since they're being paid to address it). 

IMO money has no place in this discussion.

 &gt; Since UAs must continue supporting framesets anyway, the reasoning 
behind removing them seems somewhat weak to me.

Yes.
