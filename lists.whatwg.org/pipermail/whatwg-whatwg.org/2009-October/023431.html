</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that's so, someone ought to be able to point at some examples.
</I>I just got something even better [1]: it doesn't even use &lt;iframe&gt;: it
goes away with &lt;div&gt;s, CSS, and scripting.
&lt;table&gt;+&lt;iframe&gt; would make things simpler, since the page would only
need to add a bit of script to handle the resizing.

&gt;<i> Supposing that someone can produce examples, the argument for removing
</I>&gt;<i> frames from HTML5 becomes: &quot;frameset has been in HTML till now, but is being
</I>&gt;<i> removed because we do not like it. If you insist on such use cases,
</I>&gt;<i> re-architect them.&quot; That's a misuse of standards.
</I>That's not the argument. It would be something more like &quot;frameset has
arisen several issues and doesn't solve anything that can't be solved
in a different way. If you insist on using frameset, just forget about
HTML5 validation.&quot;
After all, the only purpose of validation is to have a hint of
potential interoperability and accessibility issues. If you are using
&lt;frameset&gt;, you should already be aware of the issues you might face,
so you don't need a validator to hint them to you.

&gt;&gt;<i>What'd be the point of keeping two sources of issues when one can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>enough to cover all use-cases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your premiss is correct, backward compatibility.
</I>Backward compatibility is not handled at the language level, but at
the application level. &lt;frameset&gt; will not stop working: browsers will
keep handling it as they have until now. Leaving &lt;frameset&gt; out of the
spec only affects validation.
Furthermore, AFAIK it's entirely valid to have an HTML4 Frameset
doctype for a .html file, and refer from the &lt;frameset&gt; to files that
use the HTML5 doctype and new features. Since &lt;frameset&gt; has always
been intended to be used only from a &quot;frameset page&quot; or &quot;master page&quot;,
what purpose would serve allowing them on a non-frameset doctype?
Furthermore, since HTML5 adds no features at all to &lt;frameset&gt;, would
it make any sense to define a &quot;HTML5 Frameset doctype&quot;?

In summary: you can still use &lt;frameset&gt; as much as you want; and
trigger either &quot;quirks&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; mode on the client side. In
addition, if you manage properly your files and doctypes, you can even
have everything validating. What are you exactly asking for?

Eduard Pascual
