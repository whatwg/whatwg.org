True, but it's still easy to include the title in those cases, and in some 
of those cases doing so is actually useful for improving accessibility 
(e.g. ATs can use &lt;title&gt;s of subframes to help a user navigate amongst a 
frameset).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It does indeed seem easy to include it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but sometimes you don't have a reasonable value for the title. Say you
</I>&gt;<i> are converting some word processing document format to HTML (or spreadsheet,
</I>&gt;<i> or slides, or anything of the sort); what would you use if there isn't any
</I>&gt;<i> sort of heading to take the title from?
</I>
The filename, probably, or the first few words. Or &quot;Untitled document&quot;, 
for that matter.


&gt;<i> There are several options (you could use the filename, or look for 
</I>&gt;<i> anything heading like, or use the first couple of words), but if a 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;title&gt; element is missing, then the user agent could do the same.
</I>
New UAs could, yes. Old UAs don't.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It could, but chances are that the original filename would typically 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be less useful than the URL, which is what most browsers use when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the &lt;title&gt; element is omitted, so this rather sounds like an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; argument against forcing authors to include a &lt;title&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see why this would be the case. In practice, however, if one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is at a loss as to what to use for the &lt;title&gt;, but one has an &lt;h1&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then I would recommend using the &lt;h1&gt;'s contents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has the problem of duplicating content, which may get out of sync. 
</I>
Is that a big problem for titles in practice? I haven't seen it being much 
of an issue.


&gt;<i> And why can't the user agent just extract the title from the heading if 
</I>&gt;<i> it needs it rather than the generator?
</I>
It probably could, but that's not a reason to make it optional, IMHO.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yes, my concern is that a validator should be useful as an authoring 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; tool and not overwhelm the author with spurious errors.  As I see 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it, leaving out &lt;title&gt; is very much like leaving out a paragraph of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; text and not something that should matter for validation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As it affects user interfaces, and since the cost of including a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;title&gt; is so low, I think it makes sense to continue to make it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As it's something that affects the user interface in a fairly visible 
</I>&gt;<i> way, it's not likely that many authors will neglect to use it if it's 
</I>&gt;<i> useful to do so. However, in some cases it is not possible to include a 
</I>&gt;<i> title, or there isn't any really useful title to include, so I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> sure why it should be required in those cases.
</I>
The cases right now where a title would be hard to include are pretty 
rare. Maybe if it becomes more common, we should revisit this.


&gt;<i> This seems somewhat analogous to the &lt;img alt&gt; case; there are some 
</I>&gt;<i> times when you don't have any useful text to put in there, and putting 
</I>&gt;<i> in auto-generated placeholder text just to conform seems less than 
</I>&gt;<i> useful.
</I>
In HTML%, alt=&quot;&quot; (or a surrogate) is still effectively required, though.


&gt;<i> The number of pages unhelpfully titled &quot;Untitled&quot; or &quot;Untitled page&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to confirm this.
</I>
Most pages called that _should_ have a title, as far as I can tell. So 
they aren't relevant here.


&gt;<i> There are other cases in which a title just isn't all that useful, like 
</I>&gt;<i> an iframe; the title will be invisible, and it's pretty uncommon for 
</I>&gt;<i> people to open that iframe in a new tab and then bookmark it from there 
</I>&gt;<i> (unless maybe they happen to be web geeks like us).
</I>
Such titles are still useful for navigation in ATs.


&gt;<i> For example, see Google Gadgets 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.google.com/webmasters/gadgets/">http://www.google.com/webmasters/gadgets/</A>&gt;, or iframe sandboxes used 
</I>&gt;<i> for isolating untrusted content while still being inline in the page.
</I>
Yes, if we add doc=&quot;&quot; support to &lt;iframe&gt; maybe that would make this case 
common enough that we should reconsider.


&gt;<i> So, my recommendation is that &lt;title&gt; be made optional; perhaps a 
</I>&gt;<i> validator could issue a warning if you leave it off, but there are 
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly valid cases of wanting to produce an HTML document that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have any sort of meaningful title or for which a title will 
</I>&gt;<i> never be seen or used, it doesn't seem likely that people will forget it 
</I>&gt;<i> in cases in which it's useful,
</I>
I think this is something we should revisit in a future version. I'm not 
convinced we're at a stage yet where there are enough non-standalone HTML 
pages that it makes sense to not require &lt;title&gt; for any pages. Changing 
something this fundamental can have social repurcussions in the community 
that aren't obvious (e.g. old timers saying we're ruining HTML4), and I 
feel that we've done enough of that already with HTML5 without changing 
this also, frankly.


&gt;<i> and right now it is sometimes being filled with useless values like 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Untitled&quot; that actually get in the way of a UA computing a better value 
</I>&gt;<i> (such as the URL or the top level heading).
</I>
Are we sure that making it optional would actually affect that? It seems 
like authoring tools are pretty well baked in terms of their &lt;title&gt; 
features, I wouldn't expect them to suddenly change this.
