Technically yes, without a profile, they only have author-defined 
semantics which are unknown to anyone else, and I wouldn't expect a 
typical UA to be able to do anything with them.  So, you could write 
&lt;code class=&quot;red&quot;&gt; and define that to mean a snippet of HTML markup and 
style it appropriately (not necessarily red), but that wouldn't be very 
clear to anyone else, nor easy to remember.  At least something like 
&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt; is easy for yourself and others to work with.

&gt;<i> The class names in the latter case may be &quot;semantic&quot; in the private

</I>&gt;<i> software developed by someone else without a prior agreement (possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> in the form of a third-party spec) on the meaning of the class names.
</I>
With meaningful class names, there doesn't necessarily have to be a spec 
defining them to be useful to anyone else.  There's nothing stopping 
anyone looking at your source code and writing a user style sheet or 
user JS that works with your code.  Without meaningful class names, 
doing that may be harder for the user.

&gt;<i> As far as the UA goes, the &quot;semantic&quot; class names could be translated 
</I>&gt;<i> into Finnish or into Elvish or be replaced with unique random strings.
</I>
Indeed they could, and they would have exactly the same formally defined 
semantics as an english class name: none.  The usefulness of a class 
name to others, though, is limited to those that understand or can 
roughly determine its semantics.

&gt;<i> So in the end, home-grown class names are just style hooks when observed
</I>&gt;<i> outside the private universe of the author.
</I>
Also useful for scripting hooks.
