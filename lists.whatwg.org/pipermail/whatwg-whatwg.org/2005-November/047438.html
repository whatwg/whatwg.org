Tooltips probably wouldn't be a viable implementation, because of a 
long-standing and probably unsolvable problem with &lt;dfn&gt;: there is no 
programmatic way of telling where the definition begins and ends. Is it 
the current clause? The current sentence? (Dotted initialisms make even 
sentences impossible for a computer to demarcate reliably.) Two 
sentences? The whole paragraph? Two paragraphs? In many school 
textbooks you could probably find examples of all of these.

The reason I say the problem is probably unsolvable is that, while a 
&lt;def&gt; or similar ancestor element could be introduced to mark the full 
definition (for example, &quot;&lt;def&gt;the American term for a crotchet is a 
&lt;dfn&gt;quarter note&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/def&gt;&quot;), authors wouldn't bother using it 
because they wouldn't get any presentational benefit from it. (The 
benefit of providing accurate tooltip boundaries probably wouldn't be 
obvious enough.)

So I'd expect &lt;dfn&gt; navigation, if it was implemented at all, to work 
just the same as navigation to internal anchors in the same document 
does currently: functioning as a jump, with the Back button returning 
to where you were.

&gt;<i> ...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd prefer something even more explicit, like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	[...] should be presented in such a way that the user can easily
</I>&gt;<i> 	access the first dfn element giving the defining instance of that
</I>&gt;<i> 	term, without risking the user can't find his way back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm not entirely happy with this phrasing. I'm thinking of 
</I>&gt;<i> something like &quot;[...] easily access within the current view of the 
</I>&gt;<i> document [...]&quot; or &quot;[...] easily access without losing the current 
</I>&gt;<i> position in the document [...]&quot;, but given that the sentence already 
</I>&gt;<i> is so long, I don't see how to cram this in :)
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
How about this:

     The _dfn_ element allows automatic cross-references. From any
     inline-level element that refers to a _dfn_ element, user agents
     should make it easy to access the definition provided by that
     _dfn_ element without losing one's previous place in the
     document. An inline-level element can be considered to refer to
     a _dfn_ element in the same document if (a) the inline-level
     element has no _dfn_ or interactive elements as ancestors or
     descendants, and (b) either its _title_ is equal to the _term_ of
     the dfn element or it has no _title_ but its _textContent_ is
     equal to the _term_ of the _dfn_ element, and (c) it does not have
     an ancestor element that is already referring to a _dfn_
     element.

This is also slightly shorter and easier to read than the current text, 
and avoids the confusing and unnecessary exclusion of elements like 
&lt;em&gt; (for example, &quot;I said &lt;em&gt;font&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;typeface&lt;/em&gt; ... [a 
couple of paragraphs later] ... By &lt;dfn&gt;font&lt;/dfn&gt; I mean a combination 
of typeface, size, weight, and variant&quot;).

One concern I have that is addressed by neither the current text, nor 
my suggested text above, is the &quot;in the same document&quot; bit; 
cross-references to definitions in different documents aren't just not 
automatic, they're not possible at all. It almost seems as if &lt;a&gt; is 
being reinvented badly.
