&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me ask you some questions.  (Your answers will help me know how to
</I>&gt;<i> explain things better.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * Do you see that &quot;rel&quot; and &quot;rev&quot; based formats have important
</I>&gt;<i> uses beyond just keyboard shortcuts?
</I>
Yes, of course. That was just an example.

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that semantics embedded into HTML is important?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     * Do you think being able to provide semantics between 2 resources
</I>&gt;<i> -- between 2 URI's -- is important?
</I>
Yes, but not really for &lt;form&gt;.

Reason: generally speaking, an URI specified in the ACTION attribute of  
the &lt;form&gt; is not a web page that shows general information, good for web  
crawlers nor the like. I wouldn't like bots going crazy in my &lt;form&gt;s :).

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that web crawler usage or &quot;rel&quot; and &quot;rev&quot; based
</I>&gt;<i> formats is important?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that user script usage or &quot;rel&quot; and &quot;rev&quot; based
</I>&gt;<i> formats is important?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that extension usage or &quot;rel&quot; and &quot;rev&quot; based
</I>&gt;<i> formats is important?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that be able to use other HTTP methods, other than
</I>&gt;<i> GET, is important?
</I>
In this case, not. The way I see it, web crawlers, extensions, user  
scripts, user agents and the like can use the URIs of any resource, based  
on the REL. For example, rel=&quot;author&quot;: this *should* give an URI to the  
author of the web page, but how would this work with a &lt;form&gt;? Would you  
require it to use POST or another method? Forms are more complex than  
simple links, they require user interaction (fill the fields and most  
likely a JavaScript on the page that validates the values).

Also, forms are not for &quot;general availability&quot;, in the sense of ... web  
crawlers should *not* try to submit them (that's what the bad spam bots do  
when trying to post spam comments).

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that being able to attach semantics to resources --
</I>&gt;<i> to URI's -- accessed through HTTP methods, other than GET, is
</I>&gt;<i> important?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     * Do you think that being able to parameterize a &quot;request&quot; is  
</I>&gt;<i> important?
</I>
Of course.

&gt;<i> (One thing though.  Re-reading my message over, it seems to kind of
</I>&gt;<i> have a &quot;rude&quot; connotation.  But please note that is not my intent.)
</I>
True, but no problems :).

My general idea is this: I'm not against adding rel/rev to &lt;form&gt;, but I  
currently do not see any precise example of a use case.

Also, you need to take into consideration the implications of having  
rel/rev for &lt;form&gt;.

One last note, regarding your questions above: importance is relative.  
Some of the things you've mentioned are more important than others.

I'm sure that after having rel= for &lt;form&gt; people will come up with  
creative ideas.
