The paint is going to come within 16ms (unless the app has high latency, 
in which case it'll be unusable anyway). That's when the magnifier should 
be updated, not when the focus moves in the HTML document.


&gt;<i> The simplest implementation of the current spec to cache the bounding

</I>
The harm is what I described in the earlier e-mails. You are likely to end 
up zooming on the wrong thing. For example, if the app only renders the 
focused element, and puts it in a random place when it's focused, you'll 
draw the bounding box wherever the control was last time it was rendered, 
which may have nothing to do with where it'll be this time. Similarly, if 
the control is moving, but you only update the bounding box when the 
control is first focused, then you'll leave the magnifier behind.
