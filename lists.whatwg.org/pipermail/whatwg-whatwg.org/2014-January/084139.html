</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that implies that the calls will be made, or made correctly, if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; element isn't focused.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe this is where part of our confusion/disagreements come from.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The draw*FocusRing methods are NOT direct-mode APIs for *a11y*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. They're not really APIs for accessibility at all. They're about
</I>&gt;<i> drawing focus rings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No. The only reason for this API is accessibility. An author could just
check the focused state and draw the ring himself; there's no need for an
API to do this.


&gt;<i> &gt; By calling draw*FocusRing on a fallback element, the a11y software will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now associate that element (and its aria rules) with the path that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the canvas' state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is non-conforming behaviour that is incompatible with the API design.
</I>&gt;<i> Doing this will cause harm, because the API is incapable, as designed, of
</I>&gt;<i> being used in this manner correctly without causing bugs. For example, if,
</I>&gt;<i> when an element is not focused, it's split into four parts, there's no way
</I>&gt;<i> to draw a single focus ring around it. Thus the data about that control's
</I>&gt;<i> position _will be incorrect_ if the UA relies on this method for this data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't understand. The path for the focus ring can be anything, including
multiple closed paths.
The data for the a11y software won't be wrong, it will be the boundingbox
of those paths.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is why addHitRegion() exists; it provides this data in a usable
</I>&gt;<i> manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This HAS to be stateful because the a11y software queries the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the bounds of the fallback element to draw its own focus rectangle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The paths provided by the draw*FocusRing() methods aren't useful for this
</I>&gt;<i> purpose. Using them for this purpose is bogus. The paths provided to those
</I>&gt;<i> methods are only useful for direct-mode painting and direct-mode
</I>&gt;<i> notification to an AT API if such an API accepts direct-mode
</I>&gt;<i> notifications. If it doesn't, then the addHitRegion() API is what should
</I>&gt;<i> be used to send the notifications.
</I>

No, the AT API is not direct mode.


&gt;<i> &gt; For the blink and firefox implementations (and the webkit patch)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;informing the user&quot; [1] means telling the DOM about the region of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fallback element so the a11y software can query it later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not conformant, and will lead to accessibility problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Informing the user is an imperative action, not an indirect action
</I>&gt;<i> involving caching state over multiple frames.
</I>

If that is the case, we should drop focus ring support. There's no point to
just draw rings.


&gt;<i> &gt; Because of this, there also needs to be a way to disassociate the region
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the fallback element (ie by having no current path when you call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; draw*FocusRing)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, if draw*FocusRing() were the API you describe, we would need such a
</I>&gt;<i> thing. The API you describe, however, is not draw*FocusRing(), it's
</I>&gt;<i> addHitRegion(), and it already has such a thing.
</I>

addHitRegion is a much bigger implementation burden for authors and browser
vendors.
My fear is that given their complexity, authors will not provide a11y
support.
