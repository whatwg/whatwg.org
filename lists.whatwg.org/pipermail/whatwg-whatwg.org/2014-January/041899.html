Sure. They don't support drawing underlines either. Browsers typically 
don't support features when they're added to a spec, except for cases 
where the spec is describing proprietary features that ended up being 
adopted by other browsers as well.


&gt;<i> &gt; If doing things with CSS and the DOM is too slow, then we should fix 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, we shouldn't just tell people to rewrite their apps in &lt;canvas&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Easier said than done.
</I>
Well, sure. Most things here are.


&gt;<i> In theory, it should be possible to obtain canvas-like performance when 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM usage is constrained to styles that make layout calculations trivial 
</I>&gt;<i> (as in no-op).
</I>
It's quite possible that the solution is not to use DOM, but to provide 
some different mechanism that is more structured and semantic than canvas 
but more rigid and less flexible than DOM.


&gt;<i> However, this is still a more or less unsolved problem despite the best 
</I>&gt;<i> efforts of a large number of very smart people.  Let's not hold our 
</I>&gt;<i> breaths.

Well, no, let's solve it instead.

Having people move from a high-level, highly flexible, semantically rich, 
media-independent model to a low-level, medium-specific, mostly semantic- 
free model just because of performance issues seems like a huge loss.

Solving this means working out the use cases we want to address, figuring 
out what the requirements are, and then coming up with models to address 
them. So let's do that. First, what are the use cases we want to address?
