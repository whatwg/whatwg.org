We don't currently delay accessibility events until paint. It'd actually be
a lot of extra work to do this and I can't see any benefit outside of this
one corner case.

&gt;<i> The simplest implementation of the current spec to cache the bounding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; box when you call drawSystemFocusRing and return whenever the assistive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology requests the bounding box of that fallback element, whether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's focused or not. I know it isn't exactly what was intended, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addHitRegion will be a more powerful solution, but I don't see the harm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in implementing it this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The harm is what I described in the earlier e-mails. You are likely to end
</I>&gt;<i> up zooming on the wrong thing. For example, if the app only renders the
</I>&gt;<i> focused element, and puts it in a random place when it's focused, you'll
</I>&gt;<i> draw the bounding box wherever the control was last time it was rendered,
</I>&gt;<i> which may have nothing to do with where it'll be this time. Similarly, if
</I>&gt;<i> the control is moving, but you only update the bounding box when the
</I>&gt;<i> control is first focused, then you'll leave the magnifier behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that's a good argument that we need to handle the case where the
app updates the focus ring after it's been focused, which I agree with.
There's no reason to assume the app would update the location before the
first paint - it could just as easily begin a transition on the element
once it's focused, so it doesn't reach its 'final' location until 1 second
later. We should handle this case as well as possible.

I don't see that as an argument against caching the last known location of
an object too.
