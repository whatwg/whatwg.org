<PRE>It is possible to use the new &lt;datalist&gt; element to provide auto-suggest without scripting. It's even possible to use an external (XML) file.
In all honesty, I don't see how Google or Wikipedia would add ALL their keywords to that list ;-) The spec used to allow directly interfacing to a server-side script, but that was removed due to simplifying the complexity.

Again, like I mentioned in my other e-mail, the behavior needs to be added unobtrusive, and that's exactly what Google, Wikipedia and a lot of other websites do. You can search what you want without JS, but when you enable JS it will enhance your web experience.

Regards

*in all honesty, I didn't know there were still people disabling Javascript in 2011. I thought &quot;the hype&quot; was now to be very restrictive towards (3rd party) cookies ;-)

Hi!

The search-suggestions of search-fields as in Google or Wikipedia
should be able without scripting, only with HTML/CSS. Because some
users deactivate Scripting (for security or whatever other reason) and
on other computers (school, university, work,...) you are not able to
change the settings, even if you want to. E.g. I use NoScript and only
allow scripting on very few trusted sites, that really need it.
