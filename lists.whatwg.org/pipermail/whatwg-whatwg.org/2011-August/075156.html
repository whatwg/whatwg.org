Is the partial keyword a brand-new feature of WebIDL?  I didn't see them 
discussed on public-script-coord at all...  A partial interface sounds 
like it would work to me.

</I>The HTMLDocument interface object is current (at least in FF, and per 
the WebIDL spec) non-enumerable.  It doesn't show up in for/in loops on 
the window.  If the HTML spec were to add an attribute to the Window 
object to define the HTMLDocument property, WebIDL would make that 
property enumerable.  It would also change from a data property to an 
accessor property.

I'm not arguing that these changes would be a problem, just noting 
them.  The much bigger change, of course, is that HTMLDocument would be 
=== Document.
