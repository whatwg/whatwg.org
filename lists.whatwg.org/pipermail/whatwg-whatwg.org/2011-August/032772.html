</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not ask for any permission but to base the permission on a natural 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user gesture. For example, drag-and-drop of files to a site doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require permissions, but it is an implicit permission grant. Same with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=file&gt;. With getUserMedia() we are doing something similar: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of asking for permission, the user is asked for a specific 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; input to be selected. &lt;snip&gt; Indeed. The system shouldn't ask for any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; permissions. For example instead of reading contact data, it could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cause the OS to pop up a contacts list from which you can pick a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contact to give access to it to the app.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The challenging use case, and one that we had trouble with when we 
</I>&gt;<i> prototyped the Contacts API, is for ongoing or persistent access.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> best approach we have right now is to use explicit markup to &quot;sandbox&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> the permissions grant away from untrusted code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the Contacts case, for example, autocomplete of email addresses, 
</I>&gt;<i> names, and phone numbers was a desired use case.  A naive approach is to 
</I>&gt;<i> let the web app read the entire database and perform autocompletion in

</I>&gt;<i> attach autocomplete behavior to input type=&quot;tel&quot; and &quot;email&quot;, and to set 
</I>&gt;<i> the autocompleted value only when the user has selected it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are definite UX limitations to that approach - the content can't

</I>&gt;<i> nice if a photo gallery could trim down the set of photos from my

</I>&gt;<i> incentive for content to try to get the full set of data anyway, through 
</I>&gt;<i> some other channel.  As Roc commented, finding a way to be comfortable 
</I>&gt;<i> with a higher-level permissions grant that persisted over a longer span 
</I>&gt;<i> could be one way to address that.
</I>
One way to grant access to the whole database is to have the user drag the 
database into the app. Without knowing more about the concrete use case, 
though, it's hard to say exactly what the right solution is. Can you 
elaborate? What kind of application is this for, and what is the expected 
user interaction?

Going forward, it's possible that the &quot;address book&quot; would actually be 
just in a Web app, and granting access might really consist of dragging a 
MessagePort from the address book app to the other app. This would then 
allow the address book app to grant rights to the other app, including 
potentially bootstrapping a longer-term relationship (e.g. server-side).

I'm not sure I really understand what you are describing here.


&gt;<i> &gt; There are definite UX limitations to that approach - the content can't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide visual hinting during the autocomplete, for example (it would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be nice if a photo gallery could trim down the set of photos from my

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would seems to be ok as long as the contents remain sandboxed until 
</I>&gt;<i> selection is confirmed.
</I>
Assuming the photos are server-side, there's no way to do this without 
giving the app essentially full read access to the contacts.


&gt;<i> It would be nice for a page\site\app to still be able to access a full 
</I>&gt;<i> contacts list if desired. Though it would seem to extend the integration 
</I>&gt;<i> into the full Contacts API which is of far larger scope.
</I>
There is definitely a question of whether there should be an API for this 
specific case or if there are so many that we need a generic solution.
