</I>Back in ancient history (late 90s, I think), when I wrote the first 
version of stuff that eventually merged into RFC 4395, &quot;New URI 
schemes&quot;, I thought the set of operations an URI supported was pretty 
important.

In fact the text of RFC 4395 says:

2.4.  Definition of Operations

    As part of the definition of how a URI identifies a resource, a URI
    scheme definition SHOULD define the applicable set of operations that
    may be performed on a resource using the URI as its identifier.  A
    model for this is HTTP; an HTTP resource can be operated on by GET,
    POST, PUT, and a number of other operations available through the
    HTTP protocol.  The URI scheme definition should describe all
    well-defined operations on the URI identifier, and what they are
    supposed to do.

    Some URI schemes don't fit into the &quot;information access&quot; paradigm of
    URIs.  For example, &quot;telnet&quot; provides location information for
    initiating a bi-directional data stream to a remote host; the only
    operation defined is to initiate the connection.  In any case, the
    operations appropriate for a URI scheme should be documented.

    Note: It is perfectly valid to say that &quot;no operation apart from GET
    is defined for this URI&quot;.  It is also valid to say that &quot;there's only
    one operation defined for this URI, and it's not very GET-like&quot;.  The
    important point is that what is defined on this scheme is described.

So if that consideration is still of concern, the next question is of 
course &quot;are there operations that make sense for a stream that don't 
make sense for (current uses of) blob:, or vice versa&quot;?

If &quot;blob:&quot; was intended to mean &quot;reference to internal object, hand it 
to APIs, the APIs will tell you if they don't like them&quot;, that 
consideration may not be that important.
