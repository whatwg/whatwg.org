<PRE>Hi all,

the W3C AR Community Group has been established and is now open for
people to join.  Great work on proposing the group Ya Knygar.

Now I think it would be good to make some clear plans about what the
goals of the group are and what the scope of our activities are.

&gt;<i>From my perspective this would simply be:
</I>
        &quot;The development of a Web Standards based model 
        for Augmented Reality&quot;

If you have a proposal for an alternate goal/scope then please submit it
and we can run a poll to select what the group runs with.

Also, I don't think this group is going to work if we just automatically
make everyone who joins a co-chair 8)  At the moment everyone who has
signed up has been made chair.  I'd rather see us first establish the
goals for the group, then run a poll to decide how the group will be
managed and who the chair/s are.  We don't need to be too formal...but a
little structure would be good I think.

We will also need to clearly define how this groups is different from
the existing AR related groups that have formed already.  I think the
goal I've proposed above does that (e.g. focus solely on Web Based
AR) ...but more discussion is obviously required.

So, please join the group and get involved in this important discussion.

        <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/community/ar/">http://www.w3.org/community/ar/</A>

There's a lot happening and a lot of APIs that will directly impact the
future of a Web Based AR are being defined right now. So now is the
perfect time to get this up and running.

roBman

PS: I've cc'd all the related groups I'm involved in to encourage anyone
with a stake in related technologies and APIs to join this group.

PPS: I've also cc'd in the W3C Community people as I think this
discussion is as much about Community Group process as it is about the
content of our group.



</PRE>
