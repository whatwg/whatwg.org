</I>
What's the purpose of a degrading mechanism if it produces a result
which is ugly enough that sites will not want to use it? It's not a
goal in and of itself to have a fallback mechanism. The goal is
helping sites deploy the feature.

Looking at it some more, the example in Jeremy's blog post does in
fact not work that well since it adds &quot;please choose...&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;
as suggestions when the &lt;datalist&gt; is supported. This is likely not
acceptable for websites.

&lt;video&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt; provide good data points. Both have fallback
mechanisms which are supposed to work without script. Yet in the far
most common case people don't use these fallback mechanisms since they
don't result in a rendering which lives up to their requirements.
Instead they use script based feature detection and deal with lack of
support by generating a wholly different DOM.

I'd be very curious to know what percentage of sites that use &lt;video&gt;
or &lt;canvas&gt; support non-scripted fallback mechanism with a useable
result.

&lt;frameset&gt; is another good example where the far most common use of
the fallback mechanism was to deliver the wholly unhelpful &quot;Your
browser doesn't support frames&quot; message.

I talked this over with Mounir some more. The current design of
wanting fallback for &lt;datalist&gt; results in three behavioral
requirements:

1. Elements inside a &lt;datalist&gt; are not supposed to be submitted
2. Elements inside a &lt;datalist&gt; are not supposed to be subject to
constraint validation
3. When looking for &lt;options&gt; the search is recursive rather than just
looking at direct children of the &lt;datalist&gt;

It's not clear what problem 1 solves. It's easy for sites to ignore
the value submitted for the &lt;select&gt; if the contents of the &lt;input&gt; is
non-empty. Same thing with 2, it's easy to create fallback which works
in all browsers by simply not adding any constraint requirements.

3 does indeed provide some value in theory, though I'm still very
skeptical that anyone will use it and thus it will just be feature
bloat. Especially since I have yet to see a decent example of good UI
that can be created with it. It is however the easiest one to
implement at least in Gecko since we have a simple switch which allows
to choose between a deep or a shallow search. But as I've stated
before, ease of implementation is not a good reason to add a feature.

It seems to me that if we looked at any other feature with this small
set of sites that we expect to use it (sites that are ok with
imperfect rendering and which target browsers with javascript turned
off), and for such a short period of time (only until &lt;datalist&gt; is
supported in all major browsers) we would not add such a feature.

I'm all for having a sensible upgrade path, but I think we have that
anyway, which is simply that users will have to type the value.
