Right.


&gt;<i> Is this just an issue if the manifest or originating document's origin

</I>
That might work.


&gt;<i> &gt; What kind of information would be most useful? Should it be in the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Start with URL, because we know a URL was involved.  Then allow for an

</I>
Vendor-specific messages end up being parsed by scripts, and shortly after 
that we end up having to hard-code those messages as the spec.

So I'd rather not add a freeform message!

What is the URL for? Can you describe the way this information would be 
used in a user interface or however it would be used?

I'm just trying to make sure we address the actual problems that need 
addressing.


Regarding TLS and cross-origin requests:

I guess we can restrict no-store to cross-origin HTTPS resources, but it 
seems far easier to explain that no-store in general is honoured. 
Otherwise you end up with these weird situations where some resources can 
be cached and some can't, and the only reason one can or can't be stored 
is where the manifest is, but only if it has no-store, etc... It gets 
rather confusing.

Also, what use cases are there for specifying no-store that don't apply 
across all resources?



On the topic of appcache being used to cache everything but the main page:

</I>&gt;<i> Suppose the content of the main page change very often (like news site).
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, you don't want to cache the main page since the users
</I>&gt;<i> want to see the latest main page, not the cached ones when they open

</I>&gt;<i> However, should the network connectivity is down, the user should be

</I>
This suggests you _do_ want the page cached -- you just want the browser 
to not use it by default.

This has numerous problems:

 - What if the cache is out of date compared to the main page? For 
   example, if a site changes its stylesheet and what classes it uses, the 
   main page will no longer match the styles that the user has cached. The 
   user's cache could be months old.

 - How do you determine what is a network error and what is not? As 
   written, the appcache mechanism neatly avoids having to define this, 
   instead using a whole bunch of signals such as redirects (captive 
   portals), 500s (site down), no network connectivity, etc, as indicators 
   that the cache shouldn't be updated, but this is all done 
   asynchronously so the user doesn't have to wait to see it.

 - It doesn't provide any performance improvement over HTTP caching. In 
   fact the only improvement over today's implementations is that the UA 
   will show the page if the network is down, but there's no reason that 
   the browser shouldn't just do this anyway. In fact, many browsers over 
   the years _have_ done this.


&gt;<i> The news content is fetched dynamically through XHR and stored in 
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage. However, this complicates the news site (a major redesign 
</I>&gt;<i> of the website is necessary).
</I>
A redesign is a given when moving to appcache. The feature wasn't designed 
to be retrofitted onto existing sites; it was designed so that new sites 
could be written to take advantage of it.


&gt;<i> The current HTTP Caching still checks whether the resources are 
</I>&gt;<i> modified, but in app cache, we can explicitly say that they are not 
</I>&gt;<i> modified unless we change the manifest hash.
</I>
It doesn't have to. You can set an expiry date to avoid this.


&gt;<i> So, in this case, HTML5 App Cache can help make regular online websites 
</I>&gt;<i> far faster, as well as provide offline access should the network is down 
</I>&gt;<i> (or the server is down).
</I>
I disagree. I don't think appcache adds anything here that HTTP can't do.


&gt;<i> This would make the online news site feels online when it's online and 
</I>&gt;<i> offline when it's offline. I don't think HTTP Cache can serve the 
</I>&gt;<i> content if the network / server is down.
</I>
Why not?


&gt;<i> If the main page is always cached, then the next time the user visits 
</I>&gt;<i> the main page, it will (almost) always see the STALE content of the main 
</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then a split second later, the main page refreshes with the most 
</I>&gt;<i> up-to-date version, which is very annoying to the users.
</I>
Appcache isn't intended to refresh the page once the cache is refreshed -- 
the normal use case is to just keep the user one version behind, 
essentially. It's not intended for caching data, only app logic.


&gt;<i> HTTP Caching requires server modifications on altering the headers and 
</I>&gt;<i> is a non option for users that have no control on the server side.
</I>
Given how cheap it is to get hosting nowdays where the author can have not 
only complete control over the headers but root-level control on the 
machine, I really don't think this is a valid concern anymore.


&gt;<i> Also, many servers are mostly mis-configured on how to send the correct 
</I>&gt;<i> headers
</I>
If we can't rely on correct configuration, then appcache isn't going to 
work. It relies on specific MIME types to work right.


&gt;<i> and some proxies may alter them on its way to the client.
</I>
(Do you have any data to support this?)

It seems to me that if you are assuming the proxy is hurting 
performance-improving HTTP headers, it's not safe to assume that it won't 
also hurt performance-improving HTML attributes.


&gt;<i> In fact, we can do even better than that by not fetching the MANIFEST 
</I>&gt;<i> itself by including an (optional) manifest's HASH inside the HTML like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;html useManifest=&quot;my.manifest&quot; manifestHash=&quot;asdfasdfasd&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If not specified, then the my.manifest will always be checked for 
</I>&gt;<i> modifications.
</I>
This would only work for this &quot;only use the cache as an HTTP 
cache augmentation&quot; feature, since normally the main file isn't fetched 
down so there's no hash to compare.

Checking the cache manifest has changed is very cheap, anyway. It's just 
one HTTP round-trip, and it isn't in the critical path, performance-wise, 
so it doesn't need to be quick.


&gt;<i> I think it means that we should be able to selectively update any file 
</I>&gt;<i> in the manifest, rather than blindly updating everything if the 
</I>&gt;<i> manifest's hash changes.
</I>
You don't blindly update everything. Normal HTTP rules apply.


&gt;<i> The ability to selectively update the cached files is very appealing. If 
</I>&gt;<i> your resources are 5 MB, and you know you only want to update on a small 
</I>&gt;<i> file of 1KB...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the way the current App Cache updates everything if the 
</I>&gt;<i> manifest file changes is just too inefficient. You can say it can be no 
</I>&gt;<i> worse than HTTP Caching, but it can be made far better!
</I>
Getting this kind of thing right is very difficult. I'm not at all 
convinced it's worth it. Data showing what bandwidth or CPU savings this 
would involve in typical cases would be quite helpful in determining 
whether it's worth it or not.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The application cache is very powerful. But it is very disappointing, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that it is only useful for static pages. With a little improvement to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the Offline Web applications chapter, and of course to the browsers, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it would be possible to cache any Content Manager or dynamic page. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And that would let the appcache become one of the most powerful 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; things in the world.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTTP caches already do most of this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's far harder to setup HTTP Cache properly, than a simple manifest file.

We don't fix problems with one technology by making another technology 
redundant with it.


&gt;<i> Even we setup HTTP Cache properly, it may still not work properly if 
</I>&gt;<i> there are proxies. HTTP Cache is very fragile and not reliable.
</I>
That's a problem to raise with the HTTP working group.


&gt;<i> This &quot;Dynamic Data&quot; inside the main page is THE MAIN reason many people 
</I>&gt;<i> DON'T WANT the App Cache to CACHE the main page!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course you can then say you should separate the &quot;dynamic&quot; from the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;static&quot; and store the &quot;dynamic&quot; in the localStorage / indexedDB... 
</I>&gt;<i> However, this is NOT what the current majority of websites like forums, 
</I>&gt;<i> blogs, news sites were designed!
</I>
Sure. But the number of existing sites is dwarfed by the number of future 
sites. Appcache isn't designed for retrofitting, it's designed to be used 
with new sites that have it in mind.

If you want something you can retrofit onto existing sites, HTTP already 
provides all the tools you need, as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The current App Cache design updates the cache to the latest version 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in the background when the user visit the page for the second time 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and then it needs to refresh the page to actually update the display. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is annoying since the user will first see stale data, then a few 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; second later, it's updated with a giant refresh (including all the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; static resources).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You shouldn't store data in the appcache, only logic, otherwise yes, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the user will always be one version behind.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that there is no giant refresh unless the page makes it so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The page or the user MUST do giant refresh, otherwise the user do not 
</I>&gt;<i> see the latest main page!
</I>
This is only true for people misusing appcache with legacy sites that put 
data in the main page instead of having static logic pages with separate 
dynamic data.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That is another reason why we need pageStorage: to separate the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dynamic and the static resources.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't we already have enough ways to store data?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> pageStorage Quota is different from localStorage.
</I>
Sure, there are many different ways to store data, and they're all 
different from each other. I'm just saying we already have enough 
mechanisms, we don't need more.


&gt;<i> localStorage Quota is per domain, while pageStorage is per page. one 
</I>&gt;<i> page may have entirely different unrelated dynamic data than another 
</I>&gt;<i> page on the same domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Their quota should be separated, otherwise the localStorage domain quota 
</I>&gt;<i> will be too small if there are many pages in that domain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This can give the browsers options to give quota based on PAGE rather

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which I think is more reasonable if each PAGE is unique even though they

</I>
Quota on a per-page basis doesn't work because an attacker would just use 
many different pages, which are trivial to construct. At least different 
origins require a modicum of effort to create.

I think you're better off just biting the bullet and doing the redesign. 
It'll make your site easier to maintain anyway, and will help you make a 
more modern, more fluid site, which really requires that the data be 
separate from the logic anyway. For example, you also need to separate 
your logic from your data to make good use of pushState(), another big 
performance improvement.

Nothing stops the localStorage quota from being equal to the sum of the

</I>&gt;<i> I then add the manifest to enable the App Cache, and what do I get?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everytime I open that URL every hour, I ALWAYS see the STALE version 
</I>&gt;<i> (the 1 hour late version). Then few seconds (or minutes) later (depend 
</I>&gt;<i> on when the AppCache gets updated), I refresh, then I got the latest 
</I>&gt;<i> content. Annoying, right?
</I>
Yes, that would be annoying. Don't do that, it's not the way to write 
pages these days. :-)

It also fails to handle timeless' scenario (to which the above was a 
reply): if you go to <A HREF="http://bla/page?id=10,">http://bla/page?id=10,</A> and wait two hours, then the 
content is two hours old. Modern sites dynamically update the content so 
that it is always fresh, even without appcache.


&gt;<i> Now, let see the alternative: I build a framework to separate the 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic from the static. I have to make it so that only ONE MAIN PAGE 
</I>&gt;<i> get cached by the app cache. So, my URL can NO LONGER BE:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bla/page?id=10">http://bla/page?id=10</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it has to change to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bla/page#!id=10">http://bla/page#!id=10</A>
</I>
It's not clear to me what the id=10 means here, but with fallbacks and 
pushState() you can certainly still do the ?id=10 thing.


&gt;<i> Why do I have to do this? it's because if I DON'T, then each page will

</I>&gt;<i> That is,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bla/page?id=10">http://bla/page?id=10</A>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bla/page?id=11">http://bla/page?id=11</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Will be on DIFFERENT AppCache!
</I>
No, they'll have the same cache if they have the same manifest.

I don't really follow. It's the same site, no?

Maybe a more concrete example would make this clearer.

This is trivial to do already; just return 404s for all the manifests you

What's the use case? When would you ever want to show the user an error

This feature request isn't reasonable, it makes no sense. HTTP caching

That's already possible. The UA is allowed to refresh the appcache 
whenever desired by the user (explicitly or implicitly).

There is no reason HTTP caching can't be this powerful.

The localStorage is not limited to 5MB. That's just a suggested initial 
quota per-origin (and would apply to all the pageStorages of an origin 
too, for the same reason). Nothing stops a user from granting more quota 
if they use the site a lot.

Forget appcache; the simplest way to speed up this site is to do all the 
calculations on the server and serve up just what gets displayed! A PNG of 
the entire page would be less than 400KB!

The actual data seems to be about 150KB uncompressed in text form. It's 
not clear whether all that data has to be transmitted, nor whether it 
might not be possible to store and transmit it in a binary form or 
compressed (or both).


&gt;<i> Obviously, if I do a clean separation, and store the static framework in 
</I>&gt;<i> AppCache, and the frequently changing data in localStorage, I can only

Store the data in a database (WebIndexedDB) as numeric data instead of as 
text, and you would not need to take as much space.


&gt;<i> What I want is a 5MB &quot;pageStorage&quot; quota per page id.
</I>
The quota is there to prevent a site from taking up a lot of disk space 
without user consent. We wouldn't ever be able to make it per-page. That 
would defeat the point of having a quota at all.

Or just make sure you always use relative URLs, even in the manifest.

I don't really understand the problem here. Can you elaborate further?

This is incorrect. They are fetched with the origin of the manifest. What
