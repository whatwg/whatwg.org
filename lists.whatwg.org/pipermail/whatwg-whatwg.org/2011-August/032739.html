The reason is that I just don't think that sites will want to use it
due to not being able to get the rendering or functionality that they
want.

I must admit that you were able to construct a somewhat decent UI
using the current fallback mechanism, however I suspect that most
sites will want to use a jQuery constructed UI which displays much
nicer. In fact, I'd imagine that we'll see script libraries that
implement the &lt;datalist&gt; UI without any browser support for browsers
which don't have &lt;datalist&gt; support.

I'll also note that even your demo doesn't require that the browser
doesn't submit the &lt;select&gt;.

So carrying around this behavior for all eternity, when it's going to
be outdated in a few years once enough browsers support &lt;datalist&gt;,
doesn't seem worth the small benefit that it gains us right now.
