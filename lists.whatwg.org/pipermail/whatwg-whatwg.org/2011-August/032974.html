I've added an open-ended whitelist to the spec.

I haven't added this one currently.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't updated the spec yet, but it strikes me that maybe what we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should do instead is have a whitelist of protocols we definitely want 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to allow (e.g. mailto:), and define a common prefix for protocols that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are used with this feature, in a similar way to how with XHR we've 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; added Sec-* as a list of headers _not_ to support.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So e.g. we could whitelist any protocol starting with &quot;web+&quot; and then 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; register that as a common extension point for people inventing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols for use with this feature, so that people writing OS-native 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apps would know that if they used a protocol with that prefix it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that any web site could try to take over.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be curious about people's opinions on that matter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (If we did this, the whitelist may have to be updated occasionally to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; add new protocols that people invented that we think are fine to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overridden, but that are not &quot;web+&quot;-prefixed.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like the right approach. Even if we blacklist correctly now, 
</I>&gt;<i> needing to remember to blacklist each new protocol is too risky. A 
</I>&gt;<i> whitelist somewhat limits the potential for people using 
</I>&gt;<i> registerProtocolHandler in unexpected useful ways, but it still meets 
</I>&gt;<i> the primary use cases.
</I>
I've done this.

I've added these.


&gt;<i> I'm also curious how we could handle ISBN URNs, like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   urn:isbn:0-395-36341-1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be useful to have a web service that could look up the ISBN 
</I>&gt;<i> and direct users to information about the book, or to an online store.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As currently specified, services have to register a handler for &quot;urn&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> even if they only handle ISBN URNs.  The other alternative would be to 
</I>&gt;<i> mint a new web+isbn scheme, which seems suboptimal.
</I>
I've added urn:. I don't think it makes much sense to have a scheme that 
has a second-level registration scheme, why not just have top-level 
schemes? So I haven't done anything special for urn:.

Having script contexts survive the browser session would be really weird.

</I>&gt;<i> 2) adding to &lt;a/&gt; an attribute &quot;fallbackURIs&quot; (for lesser precedence

</I>&gt;<i> link was right-clicked)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) adding an event to listen for the user refusing or the browser not

Can you elaborate on the concrete use cases you think would need this?

I haven't added this one. It's not clear what it would mean for a Web app 
to hook into this one. Surely browsers should just support it natively?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> According to the URI spec[1], both &quot;mail.google.com&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; are valid URL schemes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;Scheme names consist of a sequence of characters beginning
</I>&gt;<i>   with a letter and followed by any combination of letters,
</I>&gt;<i>   digits, plus (&quot;+&quot;), period (&quot;.&quot;), or hyphen (&quot;-&quot;).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After running the lines of script above, typing any of the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   mail.google.com:80/mail/
</I>&gt;<i>   192.168.1.1:80
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The use of confusing URLs to trick the user into visiting a malicious 
</I>&gt;<i> site is nothing new. The difference this time is that the URLs above 
</I>&gt;<i> would trick even me, and I'm not particularly prone to phishing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using this technique to trick users would require an attacker to bypass 
</I>&gt;<i> two obstacles:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * To permanently add &quot;mail.google.com&quot; as a scheme pointing to
</I>&gt;<i>    evilsite.tld, user approval in two separate dialogs is
</I>&gt;<i>    required in both Firefox and my internal Opera build.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * If the user's web browser keeps the address field visible
</I>&gt;<i>    at all times, the user may notice that they are redirected
</I>&gt;<i>    to evilsite.tld once the URL has been interpreted by the
</I>&gt;<i>    browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Despite this, we would prefer to err on the side of caution here. Our 
</I>&gt;<i> experience with other warning dialogs indicate that users don't 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily read or understand what they approve, and phishing schemes 
</I>&gt;<i> with far cruder URLs (paypal.com.evilsite.com) succeed surprisingly 
</I>&gt;<i> often.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To save ourselves (and our users) from possible future headaches, we 
</I>&gt;<i> have decided to disallow the use of dots in the protocol argument of 
</I>&gt;<i> registerProtocolHandler().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of the IANA-registered URL schemes[2], only the following contain dots:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  iris.beep
</I>&gt;<i>  iris.xpc
</I>&gt;<i>  iris.xpcs
</I>&gt;<i>  iris.lws
</I>&gt;<i>  soap.beep
</I>&gt;<i>  soap.beeps
</I>&gt;<i>  xmlrpc.beep
</I>&gt;<i>  xmlrpc.beep
</I>&gt;<i>  z39.50r
</I>&gt;<i>  z39.50s
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any clear use cases for overriding any of the above in a web 
</I>&gt;<i> browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Opera will still interpret URLs in accordance with the URI spec, but 
</I>&gt;<i> registerProtocolHandler() may only override the subset of URL schemes 
</I>&gt;<i> containing alphanumeric characters, &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest the same restriction is added to the HTML specification.
</I>
Done. Only specific whitelisted values plus those consisting of web+ 
followed by characters a-z only are supported now.

I have made sure it is not whitelisted.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. It forces syntactical cruft upon people wishing to exercise this

</I>
How do you propose to leave the mechanism open-ended yet secure if we do 
not have a whitelist with a well-known extension point like &quot;web+&quot;?
