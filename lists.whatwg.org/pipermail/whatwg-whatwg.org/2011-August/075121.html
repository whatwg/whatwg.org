<PRE>Well, not directly an answer to your question, but the use case I had in mind is the following:

A large encrypted video (e.g. HD movie with 2GB) file is stored using the File API, I then want to decrypt this file and start playing with only a minor delay. I do not want to decrypt the entire file before it can be viewed. As long as such as use case gets covered I am fine with everything.

Kind regards,
Simon Heckmann

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to move forward with this suggestion.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Summing up, the problem with the current implementation of Blobs is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that once a URI has been generated for them, by design changes are no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> longer reflected in the object URL. In a streaming scenario, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not what is needed, rather a long-living Blob that can be appended is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> needed and 'streamed' to other parts of the browser, e.g. the&lt;video&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or&lt;audio&gt;  element.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The original use case was:  make an application which will download
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> media files from a server and cache them locally, as well as playing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them without making the user wait for the entire file to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> downloaded, converted to a blob, then saved and played, however such
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an API covers many other use cases such as on-the-fly on-device
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decryption of streamed media content (ie live streams either without
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> end or static large files that to download completely would be a waste
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when only the first couple of seconds need to be buffered and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decrypted before playback can begin)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some suggestions were to modify or create a new type of Blob, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> StreamingBlob which can be changed without its object url changing and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appended to as new data is downloaded or decoded, and using a similar
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> process to how large files may start to be decoded/played by a browser
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> before they are fully downloaded. Other suggestions suggested using a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pull API on the Blob so browsers can request for new data
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> asynchronously, such as in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-January/029998.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-January/029998.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some problems however that a browser may face is what to do with urls
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which are opened twice, and whether the object url should start from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the beginning (which would be needed for decoding encrypted, on-demand
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> audio) or start from the end (similar to `tail`, for live streaming
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> events that need decryption, etc.).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. Sorry if I've not done this the right way by forwarding like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this, I'm not usually active on mailing lists.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I actually think moving to a streaming mode for file reads in general is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> desirable, but I'm not entirely sure extending Blobs is the way to go for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *that* use case, which honestly is the main use case I'm interested in.  We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may improve upon ideas after this API goes to Last Call for streaming file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reads; hopefully we'll do a better job than other non-JavaScript APIs out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there :) [1].  Blob objects as they are currently specified live &quot;in memory&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and represent &quot;in memory&quot; File objects as well.  A change to the underlying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file isn't captured in the Blob snapshot; moreover, if the file moves or is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no longer present at time of read, an error event is fired while processing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a read operation.  The object URL may be dereferenced, but will result in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 404.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Streaming API explored by WHATWG uses the Object URL scheme for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> videoconferencing use cases [2], and so the scheme itself is suitable for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;resources&quot; that are more dynamic than memory-resident Blob objects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Segment-plays/segment dereferencing in general can be handled through media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fragments; the scheme can naturally be accompanied by fragment identifiers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that it may be desirable to extend Blobs to do a few other things in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general, maybe independent of better file reads.  You've Cc'd the right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listserv :)  I'd be interested in what Eric has to say, since BlobBuilder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evolves under his watch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having reviewed the threads, I'm not absolutely sure that we want to
</I>&gt;<i> add this stuff to Blob.  It seems like streaming is quite a bit
</I>&gt;<i> different than a lot of the problems people want to solve with Blobs,
</I>&gt;<i> and we may end up with a bit of a mess if we mash them together.
</I>&gt;<i> BlobBuilder does seem a decent match as a StreamBuilder, though.
</I>&gt;<i> Since Blobs are specifically non-mutable, it sounds like what you're
</I>&gt;<i> looking for is more like createObjectURL(blobBuilder) than
</I>&gt;<i> createObjectURL(blobBuildler.getBlob()).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From the threads and from my head, here are some questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Would reading from a stream always start at the beginning, or would
</I>&gt;<i> it start at the &quot;current&quot; point [e.g. in a live video stream]?
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Would this have to support infinite streams?
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Would we be expected to keep around data from the very beginning of
</I>&gt;<i> a stream, even if e.g. it's a live broadcast and you're now watching
</I>&gt;<i> hour 7?  If not, who controls the buffer size and what's the API for
</I>&gt;<i> data lifetime?
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Should there be a way to get a stream from XHR directly?  [It's
</I>&gt;<i> probably not sufficient for all uses or necessary for any.]
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Do we want a pull API such as Glenn suggests at
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-January/029998.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-January/029998.html</A>],
</I>&gt;<i> instead of using BlobBuilder at all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't fully absorbed the MediaStream API, but perhaps it would be
</I>&gt;<i> more natural to make a connector in that API rather than modifying
</I>&gt;<i> Blob?
