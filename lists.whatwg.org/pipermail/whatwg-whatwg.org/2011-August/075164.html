Sure, your API is more convenient in certain situations. But it also
encourages code duplication (I'll note that in the examples you
originally provided in this thread you always ended up duplicating
code between apply/reapply), which easily leads to bugs.

Another point to keep in mind is that we can always end up adding
features that makes certain use cases more convenient. There is
literally an infinite amount of things people will want to do and APIs
we can add to make it easier for them to do it. The question we need
to ask ourselves is where to draw the line. The way to do that is to
look at which use cases requires which features, and how common those
use cases are.

I do definitely agree that making the reapply function optional helps
a lot in that at least pages don't have to worry about the feature if
they're not using it. If we do that though we should probably rename
the 'apply' property for managed transactions since it's semantics are
pretty different. 'apply' for managed transactions are only called
once when the transaction is first added. 'apply' for manual
transactions are potentially called every time the transaction is
(re)applied.
