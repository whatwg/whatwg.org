</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; isn't simply init+reapply. So it still seems better to me to have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; init/apply/unapply split rather than a apply/reapply/unapply split.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; This is also pending for developer feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've talked about this with Alex, and we both agreed that having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apply/reapply split is cleaner because in many cases you'd like to know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether you're in redo or not.  i.e. more work is done in reapply than in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please provide examples. I feel like I'm fighting an elusive
</I>&gt;<i> shadow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e. please provide an example where &quot;apply&quot; isn't just init+reapply.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;There
</I>&gt;<i> are many cases&quot; isn't a particularly compelling argument unless you can
</I>&gt;<i> show
</I>&gt;<i> these cases :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And ideally also some estimate how common that case will be compared to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;apply&quot; simply being init+reapply. This is important since if that is very
</I>&gt;<i> rare, people can always implement it themselves using init+reapply
</I>&gt;<i> semantics
</I>&gt;<i> by having a flag on the object which indicates if you're in the first call
</I>&gt;<i> or not.

As an author, I would really love to have as much information as possible
about what the user was trying to do. I might want to keep my own
bookkeeping about what is going on in the document, in some other format
besides HTML.

For example, if I were writing a collaborative editing app, and I decided
that any user could unapply/reapply any change, I might end up with a
sequence like this:

Susan made change X
Bob unapplied change X
Susan reapplied change X
Bob unapplied change X
Susan reapplied change X
...

It would be great to show that in the document history view of my app very
clearly. I think knowing that a change was unapplied/reapplied instead of
just showing text diffs between revisions would be great.
