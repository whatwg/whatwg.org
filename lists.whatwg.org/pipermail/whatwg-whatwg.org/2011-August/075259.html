</I>
There are several states a browser could be in:

A + registerFoo() has never been called.
B + registerFoo() has been called, but user was not notified.
  - registerFoo() has been called, user has been notified, and:
C    + user has not responded
D    + user has declined once but is open to future notifications
     - user has accepted (or user agent has implicitly accepted) and:
E       + the handler is a non-default handler, and there is no default
F       + the handler is the default handler
G       + some other handler is the default handler
H       + user since unregistered handler, but is open to readding it
I       + user since unregistered handler permanently (blocked site)
J    + user has declined permanently (blocked site)
K    + site has unregistered itself but user is open to seeing it again
L    + site unregistered itself; user made that permanent (blocked site)

Of these, the page can, without help from the user agent, distinguish
case A from all other cases, and cases K and L from all other cases.

Cases A, K, and L, from the perspective of the page, are more or less
equivalent, and can therefore be treated as identical in the API.

This leaves cases B through J. 

For the use case of determining whether to show a promotional UI,
distinguishing A, K and L, and B through J is sufficient.
Distinguishing A from K and L is possible at the site level (the site
knows if it unregistered or not); if in the API we group those three
and make them separate from B through J, then that use case is
handled.

Moving to the second use case, settings, we see a need for
distinguishing the states where calling the registration method is
useful from the states where calling the method would not help, either
because it's already registered or because it's blocked.

Cases B, E, F, G, I, and J are cases where calling the method again
will have no useful effect:

 B - the UA isn't showing the notification for some reason
 E, F, G - the handler is registered already
 I and J - the user has blocked the site from calling the method

The remaining cases, C, D, and H, are cases where calling the method
again would potentially allow the user to register the handler again:

 C - if the user didn't respond last time, he might respond the next
     time. So you can show the UI again just in case. Note that this
     applies to browsers that show an immediate notification about the
     handler; personally I prefer UIs where the methods always succeed
     but the user doesn't find out about it until the next time they
     try to use a particular scheme or content-type, at which point
     they find a list of handlers for that scheme/type, and they can
     explicitly select one from the list (i.e. the browser is in state
     E after the method call, and the user can switch it to F, G, H,
     or I the next time he would actually use it).

 D - if the user declined once but without blocking the site, then it
     makes sense to offer UI to the user saying that he can still
     register the handler.

 H - the user once accepted then declined; it's a bit like declining
     in the first place, and so is equivalent to D.

So we need to expose the following three states:

1. Handler is not registered and no attempt has yet been made to
   register it: registerFoo() has never been called, or the site has
   since unregistered its handler. The site should consider showing a
   notification that the feature is available.
   Call this &quot;new&quot;.

2. Handler is registered or site is blocked: registerFoo() has been
   called, and either the user accepted and the handler is registered,
   or the user blocked the site permanently from registering the
   handler again. In either case, there is no benefit to the site
   trying to register the handler again.
   Call this &quot;registered&quot;.

3. Handler is not registered but the user has not blocked the site
   from again offering to register the handler: either the user has
   not responded to previous attempts to register the handler, or the
   user has declined or unregistered the handler in the past but not
   in a permanent fashion.
   Call this &quot;declined&quot;.

Since there's two registration methods, this means two discovery methods. 
We also need a mechanism for the site to unregister itself (e.g. when the 
feature has been removed), so that's two unregistration methods also.

Thus:

  void registerProtocolHandler(DOMString scheme, DOMString url, DOMString title);
  void registerContentHandler(DOMString mimeType, DOMString url, DOMString title);
  DOMString isProtocolHandlerRegistered(DOMString scheme, DOMString url);
  DOMString isContentHandlerRegistered(DOMString mimeType, DOMString url);
  void unregisterProtocolHandler(DOMString scheme, DOMString url);
  void unregisterContentHandler(DOMString mimeType, DOMString url);

This kind of thing seems possible with the above methods.

You can easily test this using JS reflection:

This isn't possible. I can't work out a way to do it that wouldn't be a 
privacy leak (e.g. suppose a porn site registered a handler -- letting 
other sites determine handler registrations cross-site would leak 
information about the user visiting the porn site).

This has a similar privacy leak problem, but with native apps instead of 
Web sites.

</I>
This is not necessarily true. In fact, I'd go further and say that it 
would be false in good browser implementations. IMHO the 
registerProtocolHandler() method's ideal implementation is to do nothing 
at all, or at most display a minor notification along the lines of:

   &quot;Example Corp Authenticator.
    This site (www.example.com) supports the web+auth: protocol.&quot;

The registration would always succeed by default, and the next time the 
user tries to use a link of the appropriate scheme, the user would be 
presented with a dialog saying something like:

   The web+auth: protocol is supported by the following sites:

     www.example.com  Example Corp Authenticator  [Block] [Set as default]
     hostile.invalid  Evil Authenticator          [Block] [Set as default]
     facebook.com     Facebook Login              [Block] [Set as default]
     twitter.com      Your Twitter Identity       [Block] [Set as default]

   Select the site you wish to use this time.          (( Cancel ))

With this kind of approach, sites would always be able to call the 
registration method and there would not be a need for sites to show promos 
to their users. 

But other UIs are equally legitimate, granted.

With the new methods mentioned above, the page can decide whether to show 
the prompt or not, if user agents prefer a more immediate mechanism rather 
than a more passive one as described above.


&gt;<i> 2. Introduce an unregisterProtocolHandler() function.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such a function is desirable because it allows sites to remove outdated 
</I>&gt;<i> handlers from clients and would enable clients to provide a UI for

Agreed.


&gt;<i> 3. Require all URL arguments to have the same origin as the page 
</I>&gt;<i> executing the call.
</I>&gt;<i>

Yeah, that makes sense.

The great thing about the silent (or quiet) mechanism described above is 
that sites really can't do much in the way of hammering the user. The 
worst they can do is add spam to the dialog the next time it comes up, 
and that's only until the user picks a default handler (after which the 
dialog doesn't show).

That seems like a rather over-engineered API. It also wouldn't really 
handle the case here since we have to pass two arguments to the check in 
addition to the name of hte permission.

Also, it's not a permission we're talking about here. :-)

This makes sense if the method fires a dialog, but is that really

Do you think we need to expose whether the page is the _default_ handler? 
That seems like a more fine-grained distinction than is strictly 
necessary. A browser may not even have a concept of &quot;default handler&quot;.

We couldn't use a simple rel value, it would have to involve at least two 
new attributes and one of them would have to accept a URL that isn't a URL 
(the %s magic). We could do this, though, it's true. At this stage it 
seems people are more interested in being able to programatically decide 
when to offer the feature; I don't know what to make of that, but if we 
are to address that need, a declarative solution is not particularly 
better than an imperative API.

Notifications shouldn't require any clicks at all. They should just work, 
initially constrained to the browser page, with an in-notification UI to 
allow the user to decide where the notifications should appear (e.g. only 
in the browser page, or promote them to desktop level, or promote them to 
&quot;send me an SMS to page me whenever this goes off&quot;, or whatever).

For popups it works ok (not great) because it means that if the user sees 
a popup appear, he can limit the damage by not clicking any more (a 
natural reaction to seeing a popup). This contrasts to the worst-case 
scenario without this restriction, which is a flood of popups that the 
user can do nothing about.

That is to say, the user gesture requirement for popups is a rate limiter, 
not a blocker.

I've still added the isFooRegistered() methods because it seems not all

Indeed. Also, you could set it up so that blocking a site for one scheme 
or MIME type would block all the site's registrations. We could maybe even 
cause it to make iframes from that site display a roadblock (&quot;You 
previously blocked this site because it registered a handler for the

That seems like a bad idea. It would preclude services from being offered

Right, that's what I mean by &quot;blocked&quot;. The proposal above (now in the 
spec) exposes this to the site as a &quot;registered&quot; case, to avoid the 
privacy leak (it makes cases where a user hates the site equivalent to the 
cases where a user likes the site but has no use for the feature).


&gt;<i> Similarly, having a unregisterProtocolHandler without a isRegistered 
</I>&gt;<i> function makes a lot of sense to me. I agree it might not let you create 
</I>&gt;<i> the perfect UI, but you can get pretty far.

Why shouldn't we aim for a more perfect UI?

Could you elaborate on these? A site can presumably tell if it's being 
used or not anyway, so what information does this leak?
