I've removed the old UndoManager API from the HTML spec since your 
proposal seems far more thought out!

Here are some quick comments on it:

 - The Transaction interface should be named something less generic, e.g. 
   UndoTransaction or something.

 - &quot;must return the object implementing the UndoManager interface&quot; should 
   probably clarify _which_ object. There's presumably more than one 
   object in the world implementing this interface. :-)

 - We need to figure out how UndoManager objects affect the bfcache and 
   the document &quot;salvageable&quot; flag. Please ping me on IRC about this.

 - What's the story with window.onundo and window.onredo? Should they be 
   dropped?

In removing the UndoManager stuff I discovered that actually there was 
nothing other than the editing stuff that referred to it, so once I've 
removed the editing stuff there won't be a direct reference from the HTML 
spec to the undo/redo spec. Presumably Aryeh's editing spec will reference 
it, though? Looks like right now the 'undo' and 'redo' execCommand()s are 
undefined. I presume that most of the execCommand()s are going to end up 
defined as undo transactions, is that right?
