Summary: I haven't removed the storage mutex, but I did adjust when it is 
released slightly to handle some cases that had been missed before.

</I>&gt;<i> Dividing up work like this into separate SCRIPT elements to scope the

</I>
Oh I agree, I'm just saying that your original point -- that we are trying 
to give people global variables without giving them tools to synchronize 
access to them -- is mistaken insofar as we _are_ trying to give them 
tools to synchronise access, that's what this whole thread is basically 
about. It just happens that those tools have unfortunate side-effects 
(they can require synchronous blocking of other processes running code for 
the same domain).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The current API exposes race conditions to the web.  The implicit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dropping of the storage lock is that.  In Chrome, we'll have to drop 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an existing lock whenever a new lock is acquired.  That can happen 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; due to a variety of really odd cases (usually related to nested 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; loops or nested JS execution), which will be difficult for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; developers to predict, especially if they are relying on third-party 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; JS libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This issue seems to be discounted for reasons I do not understand.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can only lose the lock in very specific conditions. Those 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conditions are rarely going to interact with code that actually does 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; storage work in a way that relies on the lock:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - changing document.domain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - history.back(), .forward(), .go(n)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - invoking a plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - alert(), confirm(), prompt(), print()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - showModalDialog()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - yieldForStorageUpdates()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I discussed this in more detail here: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-September/023059.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-September/023059.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right that the conditions are specific, but I don't know that 
</I>&gt;<i> that is the exhaustive list.
</I>
If it's not, then we should fix it.


&gt;<i> Rather than defining unlock points, I would implement implicit unlocking 
</I>&gt;<i> by having any nested attempt to acquire a lock cause the existing lock 
</I>&gt;<i> to be dropped. Nesting can happen in the cases you mention, but 
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the UA, it may happen for other reasons too.
</I>
I don't think this is equivalent at all. Most of the release points are 
points where the thread is about to hang (sync XHR, alert(), etc) and we 
want to unlock other processes. The plugin case is about third-party code 
causing a deadlock through undetectable thread synchronisation (e.g. where 
a plugin causes code in another process to try to grab the lock and waits 
for that to complete before handing control back to the UA). The nesting 
defence only helps in the case of preventing deadlocks with two processes 
trying to grab different domains' locks in reverse order from each other, 
as far as I can tell, which is just a subset of the cases where it is 
released per the spec.


&gt;<i> This combined with the fact that most people use JS libraries means that 
</I>&gt;<i> the coder is not going to have an easy time knowing when these specific 
</I>&gt;<i> conditions are met.  I don't think defining a set of allowed unlock 
</I>&gt;<i> points is sufficient to make this API not be a minefield for users.
</I>
I don't think anyone is arguing that this is ideal. I do think it's orders 
of magnitude better than having the API be always racy even without any 
libraries being involved.



&gt;<i> For example, a JS library might evolve to use flash for something small 
</I>&gt;<i> (like storage or sound) that it previously didn't use when I first 
</I>&gt;<i> developed my code. Voila, now my storage lock is released out from under 
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
At least this is documentable.

You'll also need to unlock for cases like alert(), prompt(), sync XHR, and 
so on (the enumerated cases above that temporarily hang the thread).

This seems like a fine implementation strategy. Please let me know if you 
find any cases where it happens other than those in the spec though.


&gt;<i> So, we are currently on track to support this feature without locking.

</I>
The spec would either require such behaviour or not; I don't think we 
should explicitly allow multiple different (non-interoperable) behaviours. 
That's worse than the race conditions, IMHO.

I would rather not require potentially conflicting things in the spec. 
Historically, I've found that people tend to just ignore one of the 
requirements (picking whichever one is most convenient for them to ignore) 
and not report it.

</I>&gt;<i> before the navigation request completes.  This is true of all browsers.
</I>
Good point. I've made the navigation algorithm release the mutex, and made 
some related changes to make sure that all synchronous events are 
similarly safe. (To make things easier to reason about, I also made all 
history.go() calls and anything else that navigates the history simply 
always release the mutex.)


&gt;<i> 1b) Suppose the inner page has a pending XMLHttpRequest when the outer 
</I>&gt;<i> frame navigates the inner frame.  The XHR's onabort handler would run 
</I>&gt;<i> before the navigation to &quot;about:blank&quot; completes.
</I>
Per XHR2, the 'abort' event doesn't fire in this case.


&gt;<i> 2) Set a break point in the Mozilla JS debugger.  This runs a nested 
</I>&gt;<i> event loop each time you single step so that it can drive the rest of 
</I>&gt;<i> the browser UI.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Install a Firefox extension that runs a nested event loop in response 
</I>&gt;<i> to an event generated by content.  I debugged many Firefox crashes 
</I>&gt;<i> resulting from extensions that do this kind of thing for various 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons.
</I>
Both of these are non-conforming situations. There's a whole bunch of 
situations that act differently under the debugger; releasing the storage 
mutex in those cases is a UA-specific behaviour and is the least of your 
problems as a programmer.


&gt;<i> It seems odd to me that this behavior was put into the spec without any 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation experience to guide it.  The only multi-process 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations that I know of do not have a storage mutex.
</I>
Implementation experience _did_ guide it. In fact, that is pretty much the 
only reason this is in the spec.

Yes.


&gt;<i> I think it is far saner to say that any nesting leads to unlocking the

</I>
It wouldn't make sense to spec it that way. The spec just has one mutex, 
it's not per-origin -- that you can implement it per-domain is an 
optimisation that is enabled by design, but it isn't how the spec defines 
it. So you can never block, the way the spec is written (since there's no 
way to ever do a synchronisation of multiple processes).

In addition, as mentioned above, the storage mutex is released in many 
cases other than just those that could lead to a thread grabbing the mutex 
on behalf of two origins at once.

I guess I could add a note in the &quot;obtain the storage mutex&quot; algorithm 
saying that if the UA implements the storage mutex per-origin, then it 
should never be able to reach this algorithm while holding the mutex from 
an origin different than the one it's about to try to grab. Would that 
help? I'm not sure it makes sense to say that, though, given the lack of 
per-origin mutexes in the spec.

How do we do that without making the mutex-free implementation correct?


&gt;<i> OK. Please note my objection to the storage mutex.

I think everyone objects to the storage mutex. The problem is we have 
nothing better. Race conditions aren't better.

The counter could be a boolean -- does the event loop have the lock [for 
the origin of the first script]. I would recommend implementing this as 
a property window.navigator.webkitStorageUpdatesLocked which is true when 
the lock is obtained and false when it is released. If people find it 
useful, we can add it to the language.


&gt;<i> Another option that just came to mind is to have some flag that says

Could you elaborate on this?

I've left the spec as is, since Rob's proposal didn't get a good 
reception.

As far as I can tell, this wouldn't remove race problems. It would in fact 
make it impossible to avoid them, since as far as I can tell you can't 
build a sane locking mechanism based on the above.
