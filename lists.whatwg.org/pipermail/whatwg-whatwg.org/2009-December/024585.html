&gt;<i> 2009/12/16 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think what I've heard from application developers over and over again
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, while the UA may provide some way to go into full screen from in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser chrome, it is much more discoverable when that capability exists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from within the content area (e.g. people are used to clicking on the
</I>&gt;<i> full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screen button in YouTube, and when you take that away users can no longer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; figure out how to go full screen).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obviously there are security considerations re: UI spoofing, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beginning to wonder how much we should beat ourselves over this. If there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are simple things that we can do to improve upon the model Flash uses
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't have a translucent overlay but instead use an opaque overlay, or
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an overlay that doesn't go away until the user dismisses it, etc) without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; totally killing current use cases and discoverability, then let's
</I>&gt;<i> consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that. Overall though, it feels like we are burying our head in the sand a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit by saying &quot;Well, as long as HTML doesn't provide a way to go full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screen, the users are safe and it's not *our* fault if anything bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happens,&quot; when the reality is that Flash is installed on 98-99% of all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machines out there and anyone who is really trying to phish people using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this method could easily use flash instead of whatever we provide. (And
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm aware people can turn off flash, but those users sophisticated enough
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use noflash can probably figure out if they are in full-screen mode or
</I>&gt;<i> not.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -Ian
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to UI spoofing there is also the &quot;annoying websites&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> factor. There is today API for pages to resize the browser window,
</I>&gt;<i> which I know that some pages abuse to resize the browser window to be
</I>&gt;<i> as big as possible. This API is one of very few that Firefox has
</I>&gt;<i> specific API to turn off, because its one of the APIs that annoy users
</I>&gt;<i> the most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You could tie it to user gestures, e.g. only allow a page to call
fullscreen() in response to a user gesture, much as many browsers will block
popups that do not result from a user gesture. Not perfect, but a large
improvement.


&gt;<i> As for flash going full screen. I heard something regarding that while
</I>&gt;<i> in full screen mode flash disables certain capabilities, in order to
</I>&gt;<i> reduce the risk of spoofing. Such as the ability to receive keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> events. Haven't investigated this at all though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>correct


&gt;<i> I'm also not sure what you mean by &quot;can probably figure out if they
</I>&gt;<i> are in full-screen mode or not&quot;. How would you figure this out? Other
</I>&gt;<i> than by installing a non-standard skin for your desktop or browser?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you can only call fullscreen() in response to a user gesture, and there
is some reasonably obvious thing that happens when you go full screen
(hopefully a bit more obvious than what Flash currently does), then I'm
hoping a sophisticated user who knows about noflash could figure out that
they just went into fullscreen. As for the unsophisticated user, they're
already &quot;at risk&quot; by flash, hopefully we could do better than flash, but if
not, I think I would be willing to accept being on-par with Flash on this
issue.
