<PRE>2009/12/10 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I'd be ok with changing the spec to allow more of the path to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be exposed. However that would mean that there is a mismatch between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what name is submitted and what name you'd get from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input.files[n].name.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that the notion of allowing more of the path to be exposed and
</I>&gt;<i> reconciling that with .name is where the problem lies, and would like to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out if we could resolve that. I think that there is a case to be made
</I>&gt;<i> for including the paths -- e.g. if I'm uploading photos to flickr, picasa,
</I>&gt;<i> or facebook, I may have already organized them locally, there's no reason
</I>&gt;<i> that I shouldn't be able to maintain that structure when I upload to the web
</I>&gt;<i> application. The question is then how that gets reconciled with
</I>&gt;<i> input.files[n].name -- I would think it preferable if .name also were
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to contain that extra information -- currently we say &quot;The name of
</I>&gt;<i> the file. There are numerous file name variations on different systems; this
</I>&gt;<i> is merely the name of the file, without path information.&quot; [1]. I guess I
</I>&gt;<i> would propose that be changed to &quot;The name of the file. There are numerous
</I>&gt;<i> file name variations on different systems; this is merely the name of the
</I>&gt;<i> file. If the user agent allows for files from multiple directories to be
</I>&gt;<i> selected and included in a single FileList, path information may be included
</I>&gt;<i> to distinguish between the files, provided that such path information SHOULD
</I>&gt;<i> NOT include information about any path components that are common to all of
</I>&gt;<i> the Files in the FileList.&quot;
</I>
If we're going to expose a full or partial path, then I think we
should do that separately from the .name property. I'd rather keep the
.name strictly be the leaf name.
