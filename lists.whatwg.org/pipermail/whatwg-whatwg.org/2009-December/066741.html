&gt;<i>     And I mean that if it is important to application developers we

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I (and I think most of us) strongly agree.  That's the whole point of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I don't think the case Markus pointed out is at all a show

</I>&gt;<i> EXIF data can help.  And so on....this seems like the type of thing 
</I>&gt;<i> clever developers can work around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But regardless.....I don't think you could argue that having _some_ path

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also agree with Jonas that if some path information is added, it might

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, with or without that extra property, I think what Ian's suggesting 
</I>&gt;<i> would be useful to users.

Yes I see Anne's and your points. Anyway I don't see yet how to get 
_useful_ path information, as the same file can be posted as /a/b/1.jpg, 
and at the next occasion as 1.jpg or /b/1.jpg, just based on where in 
the upload dialog you did make the start point.

Relying on information contained in the uploaded file does not seem to 
make sense to me, as you might want to upload a new file with the same 
name in order to replace the old one.
