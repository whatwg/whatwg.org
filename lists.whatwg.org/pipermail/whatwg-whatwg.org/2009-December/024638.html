</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm generally in favor of a minimalistic approach to this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> thing.  Ideally, we'd be able to compose independent components using
</I>&gt;<i> the API, but I'm not convinced that it's worth the complexity that
</I>&gt;<i> would add.  If pages really needed this kind of composition, someone
</I>&gt;<i> could write a thin library around the existing push/replaceState API.
</I>
It seems we agree that this is an issue with the current API 
that forces all components to cooperate, or be coordinated, 
through a central point. The rub with those thin wrapper 
libraries is that all components need to be using the same 
library and thus also requiring cooperation, albeit in a 
different way.

Examples that could be using this feature are drop-in 
components that implement things like trees and rich-text 
editors that automatically cooperate with session history to 
restore their values or layout, without manual coding to 
collect all data inside an app-specific data structure. Of 
course, these components can continue to use DOM tricks that 
hook into the browser's form field storage, but I thought 
one of the point with the state object feature was not 
having to do that.

&gt;<i> &gt; - have a notification event when entering a history entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  [almost full support in spec (popstate), *3]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this might be useful if you have independent components
</I>&gt;<i> hooking into the API.  Again, I'm not sure that this is worth the
</I>&gt;<i> complexity it would add.  (Should a pushState trigger a popState?
</I>&gt;<i> That would be a little weird.  And certainly we wouldn't want to add a
</I>&gt;<i> new event just to tell you that you called pushState.)
</I>
I agree this is the most questionable part of my observations, as
programmatic activation of a feature doesn't normally trigger the associated
event. Though, here it would simplify code as a &quot;logical&quot; page can get its
state in the same way independent of it was &quot;navigated&quot; (pushState) or
traversed (history) to.
Also, it seems like the other programmatic way to switch state objects,
History.go/back/forward, does trigger the popstate event, but maybe that
should go away instead?

&gt;<i> &gt; - have a notification event when leaving current history
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  [not supported by spec, *4]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is the use case here to allow pages to save their state right before
</I>&gt;<i> the browser navigates away?  This doesn't seem essential -- the page
</I>&gt;<i> could just call replaceState whenever the state changes -- but I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose it might be useful.
</I>
Certainly the page code can update the state on every change of
user-editable state, setting up a swarm of event handlers not to miss
anything important. My point is that this is not always practical, imagine f
ex serializing a large tree or rich-text editor on every update event.

(Btw, did you have any insight on issue #1?)

A merry Christmas to all you web-standard-oholics out there! :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are still some issues with the pushState feature of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session history, as I wrote in August [1]. As there was a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lack of discussion at that time I am raising these issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again. Below is a list of naive requirements on the state-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling parts of the new &quot;client-side&quot; session history
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism, mapped against the current support in the 21
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; December 2009 version of editor's draft.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;It should be possible to:&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - specify associated state when programatically creating a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;new session history entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;[supported by spec (pushState)]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - update state for the current session history entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;[supported by spec (replaceState)]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - get state for current session history entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;[partial support by spec (popstate), *1]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - allow for self-contained components to handle own state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;[not supported by spec, *2]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - have a notification event when entering a history entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;[almost full support in spec (popstate), *3]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - have a notification event when leaving current history
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;[not supported by spec, *4]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Notes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *1: only available in popstate event, not during rest of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;history entry lifetime (getter needed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *2: all page parts saving state must coordinate with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;shared data structure (key/value-store or similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;needed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *3: popstate event not fired for navigation with pushState
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;(fire for navigation too needed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *4: there is no event that fires before upcoming history
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;entry is activated (new event needed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there is interest, I can put together a pseudo code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example to illustrate these needs, to aid the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of solutions.
