In Gecko we build cairo configured to only be usable from one thread. This
reduces locking overhead around global caches. We could change that
decision, but that would impose a small penalty on normal rendering, so it's
a trade-off.

Resizing images was just one use.  I could easily imagine apps wanting to
&gt;<i> generate more complex images on background threads without needing to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Drawing text on a worker thread means making CSS font parsing, associated
font objects, text shaping, and bidi processing all usable from multiple
threads. That would be a much bigger problem for us than the actual
drawing...
