This is only an issue if WebSocket handling is performed in some other  
thread of execution (and even then, it's not really an issue). But I  
don't think that's the best way to think about it.

Data from network is only processed as an event loop task, so it's  
possible and desirable to dispatch events right away. Both single- 
process and multi-process implementations I know of do so - and even  
if some future implementation wants to run WebSocket code on a  
different thread, they can easily implement synchronous event dispatch  
by posting an event and waiting for it to be processed.

This is no different from how XMLHttpRequest works - browser engines  
do not need to queue tasks for onreadystate events, and do not - those  
are dispatched right away.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but then we'd have a situation whereby the &quot;actual&quot; state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> websocket object might not match the state returned by the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attribute.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This doesn't sounds like an issue to me. The &quot;actual&quot; state is always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of sync, because client and server have different ideas of actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state. So does an Ethernet controller, OS interrupt handler, low

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JavaScript code sees, and all the intermediaries must (and do) act  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that were the real thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not talking about the state of the network, but about the state  
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> object itself. You would end up in situations where, for instance,  
</I>&gt;<i> sending
</I>&gt;<i> would work fine, even though the state attribute said that you hadn't
</I>&gt;<i> connected yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose we could get around that by saying that the attribute _is_

</I>&gt;<i> Would that be acceptable?
</I>

I don't understand what this means.
