</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; worker will result in more or less the same running time, because at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the end, each worker runs on the only core.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That depends on the algorithm. If the algorithm uses a lot of data,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same time as it runs one, with one worker waiting for data while the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other runs code, and with the workers trading back and forth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally I would recommend basing the number of workers on the number 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of shards that the input data is split into, and then relying on the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to avoid thrashing. I would expect UAs to notice when a script spawns a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bazillion workers, and have the UA run them in a staggered fashion, so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as to not starve the system resources. This is almost certainly needed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyway, to prevent pages from DOSing the user's system.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be preferable to have an implementation-dependant &quot;maximum

I agree with Drew that it is better not to have hard limits. I don't 
really see the benefit of hard limits. Sometimes, workers aren't used for 
splitting a high-CPU task into many shards, they're used for splitting 
logically unrelated tasks into separate code units. This case is frankly 
likely to be more common, in fact. And in this case, I don't see why you'd 
want to limit it to the same limit as if the system was under heavy load.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that it's suboptimal. However, I think realistically a good

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, if the running time is a decreasing function of the

</I>
Sure. You'd want to remember where you left off, and start from there, as 
an optimisation.


&gt;<i> I think that the spec should say something about &quot;finding the correct 
</I>&gt;<i> number of thread for your problem&quot; and encourage authors to store their 
</I>&gt;<i> value with the local storage and add a date to re-run the algorithm if 
</I>&gt;<i> the value is old (more than two months ?)
</I>
I think this kind of low-level advice is best left to best-practices 
guides and tutorials. I haven't added it to the spec. I'm concerned that 
it's still early days for this API and so we shouldn't be making hard and 
fast recommendations that may turn out to be wrong.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; My point is that this number may be available very easily. For 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; example, in my dual-core, Linux, Firefox 3.5, the number is 2. Why 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; spare an information that can be useful and reliable (more than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; measurement at least !) ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's actually probably quite rarely 2. It depends on all kinds of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; factors, like the kind of algorithm, what other programs are running, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still haven't added this feature, as I do not believe the arguments 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presented form a convincing case. However, if you are still interested 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in persuing this feature, I encourage you to convince a browser vendor 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to implement it, as discussed here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand now that my proposition was not very realistic. However, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that something should be described in the spec to avoid arbitrary 
</I>&gt;<i> choices of number of workers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm convinced that with canvas and workers, we will see very soon fancy 
</I>&gt;<i> web video games with AI. Authors of those games will want to use as many 
</I>&gt;<i> computation power as possible for their AI, so the &quot;best number of 
</I>&gt;<i> workers&quot; will be a value that they are interested in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, either an &quot;hint&quot; can be provided by the spec through the Navigator 
</I>&gt;<i> object, either the spec could provide the above described method 
</I>&gt;<i> (improve my description or ask me to improve it if you want) to find the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;best&quot; number (according to a particular problem).
</I>
Until we know what to recommend, it's probably too early to add something 
to the spec. Specs tend to have a little more weight than we might want to 
give to a recommendation right now. I would suggest writing tutorials and 
best practices guides and seeing what experiences we get from that.

Since browsers don't have thread-safe DOM implementations, that's 
basically a non-starter. It doesn't matter that we aren't offering access 
to the same DOM in pages and workers; the actual innards of the DOM 
implementations aren't thread safe.

As soon as browsers are able to implement this, I'm sure it will be added 
to the spec.
