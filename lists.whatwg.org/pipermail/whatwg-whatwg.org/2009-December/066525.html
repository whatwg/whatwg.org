<PRE>Your main point is well taken.

There are some technical reasons why tag whitelisting makes more sense
for inline content.  For example, consider the case you mentioned on
webkit-dev: @id.  Inline, @id is problematic because the ids exist in
a per-frame namespace, whereas they're harmless when the untrusted
content has an entire iframe to itself.  Of course, @id is not unique
in this respect.  For example, &lt;input type=password&gt; will likely get
autofilled by the password manager inline and @style can be used to
draw all over the page without an iframe's layout contraints.

That said, I'm not married to a design with a tag-level whitelist.  Do
you have a specific alternative in mind?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With a sandboxed iframe, as a Web developer you can just ask the browser
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> turn off unsafe things and not worry about designing a security policy.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Besides ease of use, there is also the concern that a server-side
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> filtering
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whitelist may be buggy, and if you apply the same whitelist on the client
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> side as backup instead of doing something high level like &quot;disable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scripting&quot; then you are less likely to benefit from defense in depth,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> since
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you may just replicate the bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I should follow up with folks in the ruby-on-rails community to see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how they view their sanitize API. &#160;The one person I asked had a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> positive opinion, but we should get a bigger sample size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For server-side sanitization, this kind of explicit API is pretty much the
</I>&gt;<i> only thing you can do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think updateWithSanitizedHTML has different use cases than @sandbox.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the killer applications for @sandbox are advertisements and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gadgets. &#160;In those cases, the developer wants most of the browser's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality, but wants to turn off some dangerous stuff (like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plug-ins). &#160;For updateWithSanitizedHTML, the killer application is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like blog comments, where you basically want text with some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formatting tags (bold, italics, and maybe images depending on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forum).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine use cases where allowing very open-ended but script-free
</I>&gt;<i> content is desirable. For example, consider a hosted blog service that wants
</I>&gt;<i> to let blog authors write nearly arbitrary HTML, but without allowing
</I>&gt;<i> script. @sandbox would not be a good solution for that use case. In general
</I>&gt;<i> it does not seem sensible to me that the choice of tag whitelisting vs
</I>&gt;<i> high-level feature whitelisting is tied to the choice of embedding content
</I>&gt;<i> directly vs. creating a frame. Is there a technical reason these two choices
</I>&gt;<i> have to be tied?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) It seems like this API loses one of the big benefits of sanitizing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> HTML
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the browser implementation. Specifically, in theory it's safe to say
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;allow everything except any construct that would result in script/code
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> running&quot;. You can't do that on the server side - blacklisting is not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sound
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because you can't predict the capabilities of all browsers. But the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> browser
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can predict its own capabilities. Sandboxed iframes do allow for this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The benefit is that you know you're getting the right parsing. &#160;You're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not going to be tripped up by &lt;img/src=javascript: and friends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's true, this is a benefit. However, it seems like even if you whitelist
</I>&gt;<i> tags, being able to say &quot;no script&quot; at a high level
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, this API is useful in cases where you don't have a server to help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sanitize your input. &#160;One example I saw recently was a GreaseMonkey
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script that wanted to add EXIF metadata to Flickr. &#160;Basically, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script grabbed the EXIF data from api.flickr.com and added it to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current page. &#160;Unfortunately, that meant I could use this GreaseMonkey
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script to XSS Flickr by adding HTML to my EXIF metadata. &#160;Sure, there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are other ways of solving the problem (I asked the developer to build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the DOM in memory and use innerText), but you want something simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for these cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the EXIF metadata is supposed to be text-only, it seems like
</I>&gt;<i> updateWithSanitizedHTML would not be easier to use than innerText, or in any
</I>&gt;<i> way superior. For cases where it is actually desirable to allow some markup,
</I>&gt;<i> it's not clear to me that giving explicit whitelists of what is allowed is
</I>&gt;<i> the simple choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think the benefits of filtering by tag/attribute/scheme for advanced
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experts are outweighed by these two disadvantages for basic use, compared
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something simple like the original staticInnerHTML idea. Another possible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alternative is to express how to sanitize at a higher level, using
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> similar to sandboxed iframe feature strings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you think of @sandbox as being optimized for rich untrusted content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and updateWithSanitizedHTML as being optimized for poor untrusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content, then you'll see that's what the API does already. &#160;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature string Slashdot wants for its comments is (&quot;a b strong i em&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;href&quot;), but another message board might want something different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, 4chan might want (&quot;img&quot;, &quot;src alt&quot;). &#160;I don't think these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require particularly advanced experts to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> updateWithSanitizedHTML and @sandbox both provide features that the other
</I>&gt;<i> does not for reasons that do not seem technically necessary. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> updateWithSanitizedHTML could easily have an &quot;allow everything except
</I>&gt;<i> script&quot; mode, and @sandbox could easily allow per-tag whitelisting. Then the
</I>&gt;<i> choice would be between the resource cost of a frame, and the sandboxing
</I>&gt;<i> features that it's impractical to provide without a frame (limiting content
</I>&gt;<i> to a bounding box while still allowing styling, allowing script without
</I>&gt;<i> affecting the containing content, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here's a problem that exists with both this API and also innerStaticHTML:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) There is no secure and efficient way to append sanitized contents to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> element that already has children. This may result in authors appending
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> innerHTML += &#160;(inefficient and insecure!) or insertAdjecentHTML()
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (efficient
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but still insecure!). I'm willing to concede that use cases other than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;replace existing contents&quot; and &quot;append to existing contents&quot; are fairly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exotic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe we need insertAdjecentSanitizedHTML instead or in addition. &#160;;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps. The verb &quot;update&quot; is generic enough that it could handle different
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of mutations with flags, but perhaps that means it is too vague for a
</I>&gt;<i> security-sensitive API.
