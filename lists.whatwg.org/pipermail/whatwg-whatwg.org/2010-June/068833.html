</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it'd be much more useful to provide a level of abstraction

</I>&gt;<i> send reliable and unreliable sequenced and unreliable unsequenced
</I>&gt;<i> messages over the same connection, with automatic
</I>&gt;<i> aggregation/fragmentation so you don't have to care about packet
</I>&gt;<i> sizes, and dynamic flow control for reliable messages and maybe some
</I>&gt;<i> static rate limit for unreliable messages. The API shouldn't expose
</I>&gt;<i> details of UDP (you could implement exactly the same API over TCP,
</I>&gt;<i> with better reliability but worse latency, or over any other protocols
</I>&gt;<i> that become well supported in the network).
</I>&gt;<i>

I've never heard any gamedevs complain how poorly UDP matches their needs  
so I'm not so sure about that, but you may be right it would be better to  
have a higher level abstraction. If we are indeed targeting the game  
developing community we should ask for their feedback rather than guessing  
what they prefer. I will grep my linked-in account for game-devs tonight  
and see if I can gather some feedback.

I suspect they prefer to be &quot;empowered with UDP&quot; rather than &quot;boxed into a  
high level protocol that doesn't fit their needs&quot; but I may be wrong.  
Those who have the knowledge, time and desire to implement their own  
reliable channels/flow control/security over UDP would be free to do so,  
those who couldn't care less can always use ws: or wss: for their reliable  
traffic and just use UDP where necessary.

So the question to the gamedevs will be, and please make suggestions for  
changes and I'll do an email round tonight:

If browser and server vendors agree on and standardize a socket based  
network interface to be used for real-time games running in the browsers,  
at what level would you prefer the interface to be?
(Note that an interface for communicating reliably via TCP and TLS are  
already implemented.)
- A low-level interface similar to a plain UDP socket
- A medium-level interface allowing for reliable and unreliable channels,  
automatically compressed data, flow control, data priority etc
- A high-level interface with &quot;ghosted entities&quot;

Oh, and I guess we should continue this discussion on the HyBi list... my  
fault for not posting there in the first place.
