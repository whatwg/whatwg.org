</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retrieve the content of the &lt;body&gt; element and then to delete all elements

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are allowed, the operation gets much more complicated, and you spend much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more time to scan all elements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Conversion of HTML to text is more complicated than that - e.g. you shouldn't turn foo&lt;br&gt;bar into foobar, but you have to keep foo&lt;b&gt;bar as foobar. Implied &lt;body&gt; is allowed, you should extract &lt;img alt&gt;, you have to decode entities, etc. I think check for a single character is just a drop in the ocean in such code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if you're not concerned about accuracy of conversion, you can ignore the fact that &quot;&gt;&quot; is allowed too. It's just going to be yet another tradeoff among many other, much bigger ones.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Also take into consideration that even if &quot;&gt;&quot; was forbidden in the spec,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it wouldn't mean it doesn't happen in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the wild. Since it works in browsers, you'd still have to support it if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you wanted to parse markup from the web. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Allowing it in the spec and how the browser should  behave if it is anyway
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are two different things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're parsing markup from the web, you have to support invalid markup that browsers accept, not merely pure markup that spec allows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are reasons to disallow &quot;&gt;&quot;, but I'm not convinced that parsing performance is one of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

I think maybe the best reason for disallowing it I've seen is where
attributes aren't correctly quoted:

&lt;foo bar=&quot;foobar&gt;

Which could potentially break everything. At the moment, most browsers
deal with this as a missing quote, but allowing &gt; in the value, they
should include content after the &gt;.

Parsing-wise, I don't see it being any more difficult except for very
basic parsing methods, and any time difference should be negligible.

Thanks,
Ash
