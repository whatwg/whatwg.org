It's possible to use it like that, sure.  It makes you look like a
jackass, but it would work.  However, its efficacy isn't something
that the WHATWG or anyone else can change - if someone with
significant market share refuses to implement something, *web authors
can't use it*.  End of story.  No amount of moaning or complaining
about the unfairness of gaming-possibility will change that, because
it's simply how reality works.

There's no sense speccing something that can't be used, because a
significant chunk of an author's visitors won't ever have it.  Better
to spend time speccing things that everyone *will* implement.


&gt;<i> Is that really how we want the group to operate? &#160;It seems to reward
</I>&gt;<i> silent refusal with greater influence than transparent reasoning. &#160;We
</I>&gt;<i> saw similarly (IMO) offensive behaviour when IBM voted against the ES5
</I>&gt;<i> specification at ECMA General Assembly, simply because their pet
</I>&gt;<i> feature hadn't been included (though there was ample technical
</I>&gt;<i> justification for its omission, both in closed-door membership
</I>&gt;<i> meetings and in the public list). &#160;Happily, in that case it simply
</I>&gt;<i> made IBM look manipulative and petty, and didn't prevent the
</I>&gt;<i> specification from reaching ratification.
</I>
Like I said above, it's not our choice.  Removing something from the
spec when a significant browser refuses to implement it is simply
making the spec match reality, because authors won't be able to use
that feature.


&gt;<i> If I were to be in charge of an organization building a platform that
</I>&gt;<i> competed with the web, I would certainly consider it worth my time to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a browser and then refuse to implement pieces of the
</I>&gt;<i> specification that competed with my line of business. &#160;Certainly if I
</I>&gt;<i> were running an organization that made a browser and had a line of
</I>&gt;<i> business threatened by a piece of the specification, it would be very
</I>&gt;<i> clear how to mitigate that threat, since no specifics need be provided
</I>&gt;<i> in support of a refusal veto.
</I>
Note that &quot;has a browser&quot; isn't enough to give a company veto power.
You need &quot;has a browser with sufficient market share&quot; (where
&quot;sufficient&quot; is somewhere around 1%, based on previous remarks from
Ian).  This is due to the reasons stated above - the veto isn't a
power that we grant browsers, it's a right that they earn on their own
by virtue of having users.
