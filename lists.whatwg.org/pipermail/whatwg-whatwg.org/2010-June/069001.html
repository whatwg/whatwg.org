<PRE>Summary:  I have been persuaded that the device element is
unnecessary, given recent announcements for the
accept=&quot;...;source=...&quot; type specification proposed by Android and
Firefox developers.  Does anyone have any reasons to the contrary?

</I>
&quot;Created&quot; is as yet too past tense for something that's supposed to be
documenting practice, of which the only so far is to use Adobe Flash
instead of HTML.

&gt;<i> As there's already a standard for accessing such devices, what value does &lt;device&gt; add?
</I>
Per <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-device/">http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-device/</A> the device element is a way
for a page to request permission for its scripts to access a device.
Note that it, as a proposal, isn't finalized.  I can certainly see the
argument for implicit behavior when either input type=... accept=...
form elements or real-time javascript streaming interfaces attempt to
access a particular device:  The same permission request should occur
in either case, so why have a separate element for it?

&gt;<i> And why should this even be a HTML element in the first place, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> an (JS) API?
</I>
I don't have a good answer to that.  What do others think?

&gt;&gt;<i> input type=file accept=&quot;audio/x-speex;quality=(0-10);bitrate=...&quot; is more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important, and accept=&quot;audio/ogg video/x-webm, video/ogg&quot; are all fairly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One non-native English writer to another: I beg your pardon?
</I>
I mean that Speex, Ogg Vorbis, Google VP8/webm, and possibly Ogg
Theora if the W3C patent examination staff finds anything wrong with
VP8, should be included in form-based device input and upload,
ideally, as well as the real-time streaming javascript interface which
seems more ephemeral at this point.  On the other hand, audio/wav
should not be (it is currently referenced in at least one DAP draft
document), because it's a minefield union type, and its subtypes are
either too high-bandwidth (such as PCM like audio/L16), too low
quality (like a-law or mu-law), have such poor compression artifacts,
or are of too poor or uncertain encumbrance status to use.

I should have written input type=file
accept='audio/x-speex;quality=(0-10);bitrate=...;source=microphone' to
reflect the newly-announced Android/Firefox placement of the source=
parameter.  I would like to see something like that for device
type=audio per <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-device/#stream-api">http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-device/#stream-api</A> (&quot;This
will be pinned down to a specific codec.&quot;)  But again, I think the
issues raised here are good ones and if anyone knows why there is an
actual need for a separate device element, please tell me.
