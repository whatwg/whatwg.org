Ah, sorry I got the names mixed up, I meant to say RakNet/OpenTNL and not  
RakNet/TorqueSocket.

&gt;<i> I'd recommend doing some real-world testing for max packet size.  Back

</I>
Absolutely, that's why the path-MTU attribute was suggested. The ~64k  
limit is an absolute limit though at which sends can be rejected  
immediately without even trying.

&gt;<i> If WebSocket supports an encrypted and unencrypted mode, why would the
</I>&gt;<i> real-time version not support data security and integrity?
</I>
The reasoning was that if you do need data security and integrity the  
secure websocket over TCP uses the same state-of-the-art implementation as  
the browsers already have implemented. Secure connections over UDP would  
either require a full TCP over UDP implementation (to use TLS) or a second  
implementation that would need to be maintained. That implementation would  
be either a very complex piece or software or clearly inferior to that  
users are accustomed to.
So what's a good use-case where you want a secure connection over UDP and  
cannot use a second TLS connection?

&gt;<i> Client puzzles allow the host to allocate zero resources for a pending
</I>&gt;<i> connection until it knows that the source address of the client
</I>&gt;<i> request is valid and that the client has done some work; you could
</I>&gt;<i> still take a similar (though not client computationally expensive)
</I>&gt;<i> approach by having the host hash the client identity (IP/port) with a
</I>&gt;<i> server-generated secret.  Any approach that allocates memory or does
</I>&gt;<i> work on the host without verifying the client source address first is
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable to a super-trivial DOS attack (connection depletion before
</I>&gt;<i> even any bandwidth overwhelm).
</I>
Right, this is probably an area that needs to be looked more carefully at  
if/when real work is started on a spec.

&gt;<i> I'd propose that doing this in the javascript level would result in
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary extra overhead (sequence numbering, acknowledgements) that
</I>&gt;<i> could easily be a part of the underlying protocol.  Having implemented
</I>&gt;<i> multiple iterations of a high-level networking API, the notification
</I>&gt;<i> function is a critical, low-overhead tool for making effective
</I>&gt;<i> higher-level data guarantees possible.
</I>
Yes, no doubt it's useful for those implementing higher level APIs. As  
usual it's a matter of at what level to place the API.
