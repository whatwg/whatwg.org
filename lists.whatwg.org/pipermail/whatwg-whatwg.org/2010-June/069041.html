<PRE>We've given this a bit more thought and come the the conclusion that
textInput basically does what we want out of beforeInput, except that it
doesn't currently fire for actions like undo/redo. So, basically, we're
proposing that textInput should fire for any DOM modifying event and,
ideally, that it would be renamed beforeInput.

The one exception is for IME input. beforeInput/textInput wouldn't fire for
each composition update due to technical limitations of the Mac platform.
There's a thread about this on www-dom already.

Not sure exactly how to navigation this discussion as textInput is currently
in the DOM3 spec and input is in the HTML5 spec.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I have to ask... Why are events _before_ the edit needed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we add these, then you have to define what happens when those event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handlers modify the state of the DOM in arbitrary ways, including carrying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out operations that spin the event loop, operations that make the edit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's about to happen nonsensical, and so forth.  It's a huge chunk of spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and implementation complexity.  So I'd like to see some very compelling use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cases to even consider it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a couple use-cases off the top of my head:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Google Wave:
</I>&gt;<i> They keep a model of the content separate from the html contents of the
</I>&gt;<i> contentEditable region. In order to make that work, for every user-action,
</I>&gt;<i> they need to either mimic what the browser did or cancel the default browser
</I>&gt;<i> behavior and perform that action themselves. In both cases, having a
</I>&gt;<i> beforeinput event makes the code much more sane, less brittle and often more
</I>&gt;<i> performant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case where they want to cancel the default browser behavior (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> undo/redo), they get the beforeinput event, cancel it and then do their
</I>&gt;<i> thing. Without beforeinput, they need to wait for the action to happen and
</I>&gt;<i> then either make sense of the changes to the DOM, or undo the changes and
</I>&gt;<i> reapply their own changes. Those both lead to brittle and, in some cases,
</I>&gt;<i> expensive code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case where they want to let the browser perform it's default action,
</I>&gt;<i> having the beforeinput event allows them to properly bookend a user-action
</I>&gt;<i> and know with confidence that they've correctly handled it. Instead, they
</I>&gt;<i> currently have very complex and brittle logic listening to every event under
</I>&gt;<i> the sun in order to make sure they catch every possible user-action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Typing at the beginning/end of links:
</I>&gt;<i> Another more general use-case is needing to modify the DOM before the
</I>&gt;<i> user-action occurs. This comes up often when typing at the beginning/end of
</I>&gt;<i> a link (or otherwise special inline element). Different apps want different
</I>&gt;<i> behavior (e.g. should the text inserted go inside the link or after it).
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, controlling that behavior is really difficult. You need to
</I>&gt;<i> capture every time the selection changes and mess with the DOM/selection
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately to get the text inserted in the right place. In theory, you
</I>&gt;<i> *could* do this with just the input event, but that would get you back into
</I>&gt;<i> reverse engineering whatever the user-action was, which is again brittle and
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to get right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that a bit more convincing with respect to the need for a beforeinput
</I>&gt;<i> event? beforeinput aside, are you in support of extending the input event to
</I>&gt;<i> contentEditable elements and adding the data/action attributes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts from Opera developers? Anne, your previous comments on this
</I>&gt;<i> thread make it sound like you support this and would consider adding it to
</I>&gt;<i> Opera?
</I>&gt;<i>
