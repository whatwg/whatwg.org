&gt;<i> The 22 June 2010 spec says in section 6.5.1 Navigating across documents:

</I>&gt;<i> these steps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (emphasis mine.)&#160; When exactly is its active document created?&#160; I can read
</I>&gt;<i> this clause in several ways:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When documents are created they must set the sandboxed navigation

</I>&gt;<i> before they are active in some browsing context, so that seems wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When documents are set as active within a browsing context.&#160; But
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn&#8217;t sound like &#8220;creation&#8221; time, so that seems wrong too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; At the instant the document was allocated, the browsing context

</I>&gt;<i> active in the browsing context yet.&#160; But that seems implausible at best.
</I>
I'm not 100% sure how this all works in the spec, but I can tell you
how we interpreted this on WebKit:

1) When a Document object is allocated, it is either associated with a
browsing context (which we call a Frame) or it isn't.  It's an
invariant that a Document object can never become an active document
of a Frame unless the Document was associated with that Frame when it
was allocated.
2) If the Document object is associated with a Frame, then we check
whether that Frame is an &lt;iframe&gt; element in another document.
3) If so, we copy the sandbox bits from the &lt;iframe&gt; element into the
document, &quot;freezing&quot; them.

I'm not sure which of your bullets that corresponds to, but it looks
like a mix of your first and third bullets.  The second bullet is
definitely wrong because it's an invariant of the system that the
sandbox flags of a Document can never change after they are
initialized.

&gt;<i> Additionally, the sandboxing flags seem to be more a feature of the &lt;iframe&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> element than of the browsing context, because they depend on the value of
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;iframe&gt;&#8217;s sandbox attribute.&#160; Can these flags ever be set on a
</I>&gt;<i> top-level browsing context?&#160; No, correct?
</I>
Currently, there is no way to set sandbox attributes on a top-level
browsing context.  However, one could imagine a future in which such
an API existed.

&gt;<i> The spec then talks about the seamless browsing context flag.&#160; Is this flag
</I>&gt;<i> distinct from the sandbox-seamless-iframes flag?&#160; And when is this flag
</I>&gt;<i> set?&#160; It seems different from the others, because it can be set by
</I>&gt;<i> manipulating content attributes:
</I>
WebKit doesn't implement seamless yet, so I'm not how this all works.

Kind regards,
Adam


&gt;<i> Specifically, when the attribute is set on an iframe element whose owner
</I>&gt;<i> Document's browsing context did not have the sandboxed seamless iframes flag
</I>&gt;<i> set when that Document was created, and while either the browsing context's
</I>&gt;<i> active document has the same origin as the iframe element's document, or the
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context's active document's address has the same origin as the
</I>&gt;<i> iframe element's document, the following requirements apply:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The user agent must set the seamless browsing context flag
</I>&gt;<i> to true for that browsing context. This will cause links to open in the
</I>&gt;<i> parent browsing context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WARNING! It is important that user agents recheck the above conditions
</I>&gt;<i> whenever the active document of the nested browsing context of the iframe
</I>&gt;<i> changes, such that the seamless browsing context flag gets unset if the
</I>&gt;<i> nested browsing context is navigated to another origin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again the question of &quot;when the document was created&quot;.&#160; Additionally, the
</I>&gt;<i> seamless flag refers to the iframe, the iframe's owner document, the
</I>&gt;<i> iframe's owner document's browsing context, and the iframe's browsing
</I>&gt;<i> context itself.&#160; These don't seem intrinsically like flags on the browsing
</I>&gt;<i> context&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any other flags that might apply to browsing contexts that might
</I>&gt;<i> equally well apply to iframes instead?
</I>
