</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Or you could just raise the volume of the audio track itself.
</I>&gt;<i>         I think being able to raise the volume like this (beyond 100%
</I>&gt;<i>         of what it is) with script just makes it something more likely
</I>&gt;<i>         to be abused (think how the TV adverts always seem twice as
</I>&gt;<i>         loud as the programs they surround) and so will end up getting
</I>&gt;<i>         blocked more often. 
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That requires editing the resource. Think about it from a process
</I>&gt;<i> point-of-view: you're a Web developer and have been given a set of
</I>&gt;<i> media resources to put on a Website. As you put it all together, you
</I>&gt;<i> notice that the volume of the different files is different and thus
</I>&gt;<i> playing them back next to each other will create a very confusing user
</I>&gt;<i> experience. Do you really want to shoot the files back to the
</I>&gt;<i> production to adjust the volume settings so they are all similar? If
</I>&gt;<i> you're under time pressure, you'd probably much prefer just setting a
</I>&gt;<i> volume attribute on each so they all play back with the same level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your example of TV ads being louder than the rest of the program is
</I>&gt;<i> indeed a production issue but would not replicable through a volume
</I>&gt;<i> setting for the resource, since that volume applies to the whole
</I>&gt;<i> resource and not just to the ad clip inside it. I don't think that
</I>&gt;<i> kind of abuse would originate from JavaScript - it already originates
</I>&gt;<i> from production and doesn't really apply to this issue.

If, like you mentioned in your example, all the media files are of
different volumes, then your script would have to somehow detect the
actual real volume of them in order to give the right level of
adjustment for normalisation, something which I don't believe is
possible just at the moment.

If I was in such a situation, yes I would most likely send them back to
the post production team, or at the very least normalise them myself
with ffmpeg or some similar tool.

It would be like sourcing a bunch of images for a website and using
canvas to applying a filter to adjust the light volumes of them all.
Sure, it might be possible, but the images really should have been
adjusted before they were used on the site. Why should we encourage
sloppy content producers?

Thanks,
Ash
