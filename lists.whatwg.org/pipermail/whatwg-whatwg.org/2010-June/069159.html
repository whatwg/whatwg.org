Not quite.  The technical motivation was that there was no clear path
to that requirement getting interop.  The reasons for that were
political/legal, but their effect was technical.


&gt;<i>&#160;How

</I>&gt;<i> change to require ImageData for Canvas,
</I>
On the WHATWG wiki a Rationale page is being assembled by a volunteer
(don't know their name, but they go by 'variable' in #whatwg) to
document the reasoning behind various decisions that come up in
questions.  Beyond that, mailing-list diving.


&gt;<i> or participate in their
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation prior to them gaining the incumbent's advantage of being
</I>&gt;<i> present in the specification text?
</I>
Depends on the feature and where it originated.  WHATWG operates on
commit-then-review, so as soon as Hixie hits something in his email
dive and thinks it's sufficiently good, he writes it up.  There can
sometimes be a significant delay between something being proposed and
this happening, though, so within that timespan things can be
discussed without the &quot;incumbent advantage&quot; you talk about.  That
advantage isn't worth much, though, at least not until somebody starts
shipping something.
