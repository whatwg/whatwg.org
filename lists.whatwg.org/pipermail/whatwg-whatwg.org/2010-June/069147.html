First can we work on improving communications so that we can work on
differences before they become conflicts?

We recently had a change proposal made by Lachlan:

<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Apr/1107.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Apr/1107.html</A>

Absolutely nobody in the W3C WG indicated any issues with this proposal:

<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jun/0562.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jun/0562.html</A>

Recently you said that you value convergence:

<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jun/0525.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jun/0525.html</A>

Yet, when you made the change, you did it in a way that made the
WHATWG version not a proper superset.  You also characterized the
change in a way that I don't believe is accurate:

<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/commit-watchers-whatwg.org/2010/004270.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/commit-watchers-whatwg.org/2010/004270.html</A>

I'm having trouble reconciling all of the above.  You clearly continue
to be a member of the W3C Working Group.  You state that you value
convergence.  You were given ample opportunity to state an objection.
And you clearly have an issue with Lanlan's suggestion.

How can we improve communications to prevent misunderstandings such as
this one from occurring in the future?

What's the best way to address the mischaracterization of the
difference as it is currently described in the WHATWG draft?

Most importantly, how can we deescalate tensions rather that
continuing in this manner?
