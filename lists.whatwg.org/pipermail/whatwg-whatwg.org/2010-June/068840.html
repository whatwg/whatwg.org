I was hoping to be able to avoid looking at what the interfaces of a high  
vs low level option would look like this early on in the discussions, but  
perhaps we need to do just that; look at Torque, RakNet etc and find a  
least common denominator and see what the reactions would be to such an  
interface. Game companies are pretty restrictive about what they discuss,  
but I think I know enough game devs to at least get some good feedback on  
what would be required to make it work well with their engine/game.

&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect they prefer to be &quot;empowered with UDP&quot; rather than &quot;boxed  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high level protocol that doesn't fit their needs&quot; but I may be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you put it like that, I don't see why anybody would not want to be

</I>
Yeah I wouldn't put it like that when asking :) I'm really not trying to  
sell my view, I just like to see real browser gaming in a not too distant  
future.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that's not the choice, since they could never really have UDP -
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol will perhaps have to be Origin-based, connection-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> (to exchange Origin information etc), with complex packet headers so
</I>&gt;<i> you can't trick it into talking to a DNS server, with rate limiting in
</I>&gt;<i> the browser to prevent DOS attacks, restricted to client-server (no
</I>&gt;<i> peer-to-peer since you probably can't run a socket server in the
</I>&gt;<i> browser), etc.
</I>[...]
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That first option sounds like you're offering something very much like
</I>&gt;<i> a plain UDP socket (and I guess anyone who's willing to write their
</I>&gt;<i> own high-level wrapper (which is only hundreds or thousands of lines
</I>&gt;<i> of code and not a big deal for a complex game) would prefer that since
</I>&gt;<i> they want as much power as possible), but (as above) I think that's
</I>&gt;<i> misleading - it's really a UDP interface on top of a protocol that has
</I>&gt;<i> some quite different characteristics to UDP. So I think the question
</I>&gt;<i> should be clearer that the protocol will necessarily include various
</I>&gt;<i> features and restrictions on top of UDP, and the choice is whether it
</I>&gt;<i> includes the minimal set of features needed for security and hides
</I>&gt;<i> them behind a UDP-like interface or whether it includes higher-level
</I>&gt;<i> features and exposes them in a higher-level interface.
</I>
So, what would the minimal set of limitations be to make a &quot;UDP WebSocket&quot;  
browser-safe?

-No listen sockets
-No multicast
-Reliable handshake with origin info
-Automatic keep-alives
-Reliable close handshake
-Socket is bound to one address for the duration of its lifetime
-Sockets open sequentially (like current DOS protection in WebSockets)
-Cap on number of open sockets per server and total per user agent
