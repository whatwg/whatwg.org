<PRE>&gt;<i> A agree disallowing &quot;&gt;&quot; chars in attributes greatly simplifies parsing. Not
</I>&gt;<i> only with regular expressions, but any parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> If &quot;&gt;&quot; are allowed, it means that in order to found the end of the element
</I>&gt;<i> you do have to read all attributes before. This is very costy.
</I>
You just need two extra states in the parser (toggled on &quot; or '). I wouldn't call that &quot;very costly&quot;.

&gt;<i> Just an
</I>&gt;<i> example but they are many others:  let's image you'd like to convert an HTML
</I>&gt;<i> document into flat text. To simplify you're algorithm you've chosen  to
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve the content of the &lt;body&gt; element and then to delete all elements
</I>&gt;<i> in it. This is very fast if &quot;&gt;&quot; are not allowed in attributes because you're
</I>&gt;<i> able found elements bounds just by searching &quot;&lt;&quot; and then &quot;&gt;&quot;.  But if &quot;&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are allowed, the operation gets much more complicated, and you spend much
</I>&gt;<i> more time to scan all elements.
</I>
Conversion of HTML to text is more complicated than that - e.g. you shouldn't turn foo&lt;br&gt;bar into foobar, but you have to keep foo&lt;b&gt;bar as foobar. Implied &lt;body&gt; is allowed, you should extract &lt;img alt&gt;, you have to decode entities, etc. I think check for a single character is just a drop in the ocean in such code.

And if you're not concerned about accuracy of conversion, you can ignore the fact that &quot;&gt;&quot; is allowed too. It's just going to be yet another tradeoff among many other, much bigger ones.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also take into consideration that even if &quot;&gt;&quot; was forbidden in the spec,
</I>&gt;<i> it wouldn't mean it doesn't happen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the wild. Since it works in browsers, you'd still have to support it if
</I>&gt;<i> you wanted to parse markup from the web. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing it in the spec and how the browser should  behave if it is anyway
</I>&gt;<i> are two different things.
</I>
If you're parsing markup from the web, you have to support invalid markup that browsers accept, not merely pure markup that spec allows.

There are reasons to disallow &quot;&gt;&quot;, but I'm not convinced that parsing performance is one of them.
