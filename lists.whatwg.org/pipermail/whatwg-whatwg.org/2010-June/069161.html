The Wikimedia California Chapter initial funding proposal has some
interactive map work in it, if people are interested.  I've been
trying to raise money for it but it's been going pretty slow.  Anyone
who cares can find it on line.  It needs $150,000 plus management
salary to get going as a viable concern.  The point here is that even
free things take time and/or money to get right and and get open
right.

Locations should have security considerations similar to contacts.  It
seems reasonable to assume that people are going to want to download
them more than upload them, unless they have a very tightly controlled
assumption about of the list of recipients, and some assurance that
their assumptions are correct.  Also locations share a lot in common
with the user's contacts, of course, including the fact that at least
one is associated with the user.  (Telepresence is an interesting
example of a situation where a person may be associated with multiple
locations, but those are so rare that example seems contrived.)
