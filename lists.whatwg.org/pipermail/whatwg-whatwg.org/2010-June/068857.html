I'm trying to think of them mainly as indirect examples of use cases,
rather than as direct examples of interfaces. Under the assumption
that most games either use a library like these or implement a
comparable one themselves, and that the library designs are driven by
the game requirements, if a feature is supported by most of the
libraries then it's probably needed by many games; and if a feature is
unsupported in many of the libraries then it's probably unnecessary
for most games. (Also an assumption: games running in web browsers
will have similar needs to native games (though lagging many years
behind state-of-the-art); and we only ought to aim to support the
needs of most games, not all games.)

So they seem to suggest things like:
- many games need a combination of reliable and unreliable-ordered and
unreliable-unordered messages.
- many games need to send large messages (so the libraries do
automatic fragmentation).
- many games need to efficiently send tiny messages (so the libraries
do automatic aggregation).
- many games need some kind of security (I have no idea exactly what,
or how much is still relevant when the client is JavaScript and
trivial to tamper with).
- many games need to prioritise certain messages when bandwidth is limited.
- most games don't need low-level control over individual datagrams
and precise packet loss feedback, they're okay with the socket details
being abstracted away.
- ... probably lots more (and/or less); I'm not very familiar with the
details of the libraries so this is unlikely to be an accurate list,
but I think it may be a useful way to analyse the requirements.

(The solution suggested in your initial post
(socket.send(data_smaller_than_mtu) going over UDP) seems to be one
extreme, which combines with higher-level JS libraries to satisfy
these needs. I think I initially suggested the other extreme of
encoding all the features into the browser API. I guess the best
tradeoff depends largely on what non-game use cases exist that should
be satisfied by the same solution.)

&gt;<i> So, what would the minimal set of limitations be to make a &quot;UDP WebSocket&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> browser-safe?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -No listen sockets
</I>&gt;<i> -No multicast
</I>&gt;<i> -Reliable handshake with origin info
</I>&gt;<i> -Automatic keep-alives
</I>&gt;<i> -Reliable close handshake
</I>&gt;<i> -Socket is bound to one address for the duration of its lifetime
</I>&gt;<i> -Sockets open sequentially (like current DOS protection in WebSockets)
</I>&gt;<i> -Cap on number of open sockets per server and total per user agent
</I>
Perhaps also:
- Cap or dynamic limit on bandwidth (you don't want a single web page
flooding the user's network connection and starving all the TCP
connections)
- Protection against session hijacking
- Protection against an attacker initiating a legitimate socket with a
user and then redirecting it (with some kind of IP (un)hijacking) to a
service behind the user's firewall (which isn't a problem when using
TCP since the service will ignore packets when it hasn't done the TCP
handshake; but UDP services might respond to a single packet from the
middle of a websocket stream, so every single packet will have to be
careful not to be misinterpreted dangerously by unsuspecting
services).
