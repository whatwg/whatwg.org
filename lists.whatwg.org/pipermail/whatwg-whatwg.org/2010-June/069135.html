If the only purpose of an HTML contents was to be displayed by a browser, I would agree with you.
We have to consider that XML contents, and therefore HTML contents, has many finalities in the world including in the industry. It is an evidence for XML, but it is also true for HTML.
In the industry, parsing the content is essential, whatever the method is.
I understand that for the browser finality, the tolerance to the specification must be large in order to display something even if the webmaster has made mistakes in the source. You also don't mind to be obliged to parse all attributes because quite all of them have an impact for the browser. 
In another hand, in the industry the tolerance to the spec is often very low in order build simple, fast and robust processes. They are also many parsing purposes that care about some elements and don't care about others. I can give examples if needed, but we can foresee this is true.

Allowing &quot;&gt;&quot; in attributes is a small gift of tolerance for webmasters, but implies major complications for the industry.
Disallowing &quot;&gt;&quot; falls within the purpose of simplifying the grammar, like when  XHTML disallowed the uppercase for element and attribute names, like when XHTML  disallowed attribute values without  quotes....

PS: Of course my previous example is not a realistic one. That was a technical illustration of the issue.
