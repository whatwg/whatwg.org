Do people really expect to be able to get any of this right with a
wide range of mobile devices?

A number of the mobile devices I work with have fairly amusing on
screen keyboard behaviors.

I'm also now cursed by the fact that Google has decided to provide its
major sites (Google, Google News) with an incredibly small typeface to
my mobile phone. In addition to this Google News sends me to the WAP
version of CBSNews. Which shares Google News Mobile's incredibly small
typeface.

I don't think DPI is generally provided to web sites (beyond the CSS
magic for DPI) and as it happens the platforms I use don't seem
interested in offering correct DPI for the next couple of years.

This ignores the fact that &quot;having a predictable way of tricking the
user into giving away their password&quot; is a bad thing.

Sadly I don't have specific answers. Last night I added some css to
one of my phones to make the font size for cbsnews readable, but it's
really brutal:

@-moz-document url-prefix(<A HREF="http://wap">http://wap</A>) {
 * { font-size: .2in !important; }
}

But there's no way for a normal user to do this, and there's no way to
do it in a usable manner in general. Roughly, to &quot;fix&quot; sites, I'd need
to be able to use things like:

@-moz-document url-prefix(<A HREF="http://wap">http://wap</A>), url-match(/m/) {
screen {
  declared-width: 100px /* this can't be set by web content and only
applies to screen, so !important isn't needed */;
  declared-height: 56px /* this can't be set by web content and only
applies to screen, so !important isn't needed */;
  declared-dpi: 60 60 /* this can't be set by web content and only
applies to screen, so !important isn't needed */;
}
}
or
@-moz-document url-prefix(<A HREF="http://wap">http://wap</A>), url-match(/m/) {
body {
  relative-scaling: .2in/8px /* this can't be set by web content, so
!important isn't needed. it should mean that any content font sizes
are taken as a scaling factor against 8px which should be treated as
0.2 inches*/;
}

With something which could specify screen width/height (to force
layout to be calculated as if my screen were as tiny (in pixels) as
sites think it is instead of 8x wider than they're expecting, and
screen dpi). And they'd have to be limited to only being valid for
userContent.css (not available to web pages).

In theory, WebGL can be great, but if people try to create a 4px webgl
accelerated button (i.e. invisible), that doesn't enable me, as a
user, to interact with it.

I also want to remind people that &quot;hiding browser chrome&quot; will often
mean &quot;hiding the on screen keyboard&quot; (it's chrome shiny). Which is
often the only keyboard a user has ([Mr. Vanik: If you want a Nokia
n800, I can ship one to you). Google's approach to the lack of a real
keyboard in devices is to implement their own keyboard. But many app
developers will not do this.
