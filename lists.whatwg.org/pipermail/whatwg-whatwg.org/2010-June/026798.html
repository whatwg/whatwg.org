It's very important that the HTML5 spec address developers' needs without crippling their abilities due to unfounded or incorrect security implementations. This is the problem we've been dealing with in regard to the file input uploaders for years, trying to simply apply a little CSS style to them.

Adobe has blocked inappropriate use of fullscreen by tying that functionality to the click of a button. It can't be done onload or programmatically, it requires a user's interaction. The HTML5 spec can provide the same thing for fullscreen video. It's no different than the security used for HTML file inputs &#8211; you can't open a a File Browse Dialog, the user must click a button.

I sincerely hope developers' needs aren't made secondary in such debates. While I appreciate proper browser security, in some cases it forces us to just look for workarounds to circumvent the security. The lack of fullscreen is a serious issue for us as we deal with clients and superiors who ask us to replace the Flash video player with an HTML5 video player... only to have us go back to them and say &quot;Here is the cool player with custom controls... sorry, you can't do fullscreen though, it's not allowed&quot;. The obvious response to this is &quot;Flash can, why can't HTML5?&quot; and &quot;well, let's just use Flash then.&quot;

Finally, in reference to the CSSOM Ian, I'm not sure this is what you are referring to, but another solution to the fullscreen issue is if the browser default controls could be styled with CSS. This would be a real win-win, as we could have our secure fullscreen button (as implemented in Webkit but not Firefox strangely) and also have a faster path to custom controls.

While I would guess this would be a CSSOM issue, it seems that it would still be a recommendation by WHATWG.
