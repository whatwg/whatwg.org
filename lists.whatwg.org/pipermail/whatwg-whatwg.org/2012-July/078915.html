Done.

I don't follow this proposal.

I checked the list but didn't see any recent relevant e-mails from anyone 
named Richard or Steve. If they filed bugs, I hope to get to those soon; 
I've been focusing on e-mail for a while to get the e-mail pile under 
control after having neglected it for too long.


Re: using backing bitmaps for hit testing:

</I>
That's an interesting idea. I haven't added this yet, but it seems like 
something we should definitely keep in mind; if it turns out that the hit 
region API is popular, it would definitely be a logical next step.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It doesn't allow for sub pixel testing. In your algorithm above, only

</I>
Certainly implementations are welcome to use a hit region list with fine 
paths, rather than pixels, so long as the effect is equivalent.
