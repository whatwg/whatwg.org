</I>In case of differences, often, if some content is found to behave 
differently, some browsers will fix to align with the others after 
discussion (usually in standards mailing-lists, because that's what they 
are really here for).
If at some point all content decide to follow what some browser say, the 
others will follow creating a de facto standard.

You seem to be worried about what browsers will implement, but in the 
long term, there is no reason. In the long term, they will all align on 
parts of the spec that matter (that people cover by writing actual 
content for it).
I admit short term is a bit more chaotic, though.
