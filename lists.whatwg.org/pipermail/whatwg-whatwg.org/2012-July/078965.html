</I>Who are those different groups? As far as I know, the major producer of 
HTML content is a group usually refered as &quot;web developers&quot;.
I have a genuine question which is: does what any other group think 
about HTML matters?

&gt;<i> Let's just hope all major vendors will chose the same...
</I>This statement seems very upside down to me. Some people thinks 
standards follow this path:
1) a spec is written
2) some folks (browser vendors) implement it
3) some other folks (web devs) build on top of that.
I don't know how to say that, but this model is plain wrong. Maybe it 
works in some industry. Maybe it works for some languages, but it's not 
the case for web technologies (HTML included).

Reality is that implementors implement and for the most part, the spec 
codifies *afterwards* what has been implemented. The biggest part of 
HTML5 has been exactly that. And sometimes between the first 
implementation and the standard, other implement the same thing. 
Sometimes with bug, sometimes they get the initial implementors to fix a 
bug before copying it, sometimes no one care about what has been 
implemented and it's removed.

In the end, all majors vendors will keep doing what they have always 
been doing and for most part, since they all have the constraint to 
properly render at least what others render properly, there will be at 
worst a de facto standard if the standard either doesn't cover this case 
or is not properly describing what is actually implemented.

Who writes the spec, what is in the spec is at no point the most 
important piece of the puzzle, because if no one follows the spec, it's 
just a useless piece of document.
My good news for you is the following: all relevant specs will codify 
what all major vendors choose to do.

David
