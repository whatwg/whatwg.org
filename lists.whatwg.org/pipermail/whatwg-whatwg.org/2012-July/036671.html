</I>
This does seem to be a valid problem.

</I>
&lt;select&gt;s are an interesting problem, because they limit the valid inputs. 
So do features like maxlength=&quot;&quot;, pattern=&quot;&quot;, etc. I suppose the solution 
is to allow the user agent to have multiple possible autofill values for 
each autofill field, or to just allow the user agent to make suggestions 
based on any information it may have... Actually we pretty much have to do 
that anyway. There's not really any UA-testable conformance criteria for 
this feature, it's just providing information for the UA to make more 
intelligent editors possible.

</I>
I have no objection to us introducing new input types, but that seems 
orthogonal to the issue of introducing a way to label a field as being a 
certain piece of data.

That is, &quot;address&quot; is a type; &quot;shipping address&quot; is a field. A fax 
number, mobile number, home number, work number: they're all &quot;tel&quot;, but 
they're each different fields.

Anyway, if we want to experiment with higher-level types like &quot;address&quot; 
then I recommend interested vendors implement such ideas in their dev 
versions as e.g. type=&quot;x-address&quot;. I think that's somewhat orthogonal to 
what we have in the realm of autofill -- existing pages and database 
schemas are based on certain fields, which is presumably what we should 
expose. But similarly, we shouldn't preclude this being added in the 
future. This suggests that maybe we should have a field name &quot;address&quot; 
that encompasses all the various address-related fields into one. Might be 
best to leave that out until we have such an input type though.


&gt;<i> Other input types like 'email' and 'tel' should be able to solve the 
</I>&gt;<i> phone, fax and email autocompletetypes I believe. Authors should stop 
</I>&gt;<i> using multiple fields for telephone and use &lt;input type='tel'&gt; instead. 
</I>
I don't think it makes sense to have different input control types for 
work phone numbers vs home phone numbers. They're both phone numbers.


&gt;<i> Also, I do not understand why we have credit cards types. Is anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to have his credit cards information saved locally?
</I>
Sure, why not?


&gt;<i> Is any website not using autocomplete=off as soon as credit cards are 
</I>&gt;<i> involved?
</I>
Those that do that are incredibly annoying.

Yeah I don't see that as a viable option really. They're orthogonal 
concerns.

Reusing vocabularies is good where possible (so long as it doesn't 
interfere with solving the problems), but yeah, we can't really match more 
than one at a time.

Other vocabularies of relevance, in case anyone wants to study them: OASIS 
xAL, vCard, Apple AddressBook, ECML, Microsoft's Windows APIs.

Yeah, it seems better to address existing Web apges.

In a conversation on #chromium, Ilya linked me to this directory:

   <A HREF="https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/data/autofill/heuristics/input/">https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/test/data/autofill/heuristics/input/</A>

This is a list of sample forms derived from a big study of real-world 
sites, which is very useful.

Yeah, using autocomplete=&quot;&quot; in this way makes a lot of sense I think.


Studying the forms in the listing cited above, it seems that fields fall 
into these categories:

Separate forms all found in the same &lt;form&gt;, e.g. for pages that contain 
multiple products each with their own set of fields, only one product of 
which is shown at a time. At a high level, the use agent should treat each 
of these as a separate &lt;form&gt; for autofill purposes.

Each of these can have information for different people or facets of 
people:
 - shipping information
 - billing information
 - generic user information (e.g. when it's not a shipping order form)

Each of these sections can then have subinformation:
 - name (and its subfields, such as &quot;honorific-prefix&quot;, &quot;nickname&quot;, etc)
 - &quot;organisation&quot; name, the user's &quot;organisation-title&quot;
 - physical address (and its subfields, such as &quot;city&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, etc)
 - contact information category, e.g. &quot;home&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;cell&quot;, &quot;fax&quot;
    - each of which has subinformation such as &quot;email&quot;, &quot;tel&quot; (and their 
      subfields, such as &quot;country-code&quot;)
 - credit card details (and subfields such as &quot;name&quot;, &quot;exp&quot; etc)
 - personal information (such as &quot;bday&quot;, &quot;url&quot;, &quot;photo&quot;)

So we could define the autocomplete=&quot;&quot; field's value as follows:

   &quot;on&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, or:
   [section] [subsection] [generic-field | [contact-type] contact-field]

...where

   section       = high-level section name; author-defined string starting
                   with the prefix &quot;section-&quot;
   subsection    = &quot;shipping&quot; or &quot;billing&quot;
   generic-field = one of: name, honorific-prefix, given-name, 
                           additional-name, family-name, honorific-suffix,
                           nickname, organisation-title, organisation,
                           street-address, address-line1, address-line2,
                           address-line3, locality, region, country, 
                           postal-code, cc-name, cc-given-name, 
                           cc-additional-name, cc-family-name, cc-number, 
                           cc-exp, cc-exp-month, cc-exp-year, cc-csc, 
                           language, bday, bday-day, bday-month, 
                           bday-year, sex, url, photo
   contact-type  = &quot;home&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;cell&quot;, or &quot;fax&quot;
   contact-field = one of: email, tel, tel-country-code, tel-national,
                           tel-area-code, tel-local, tel-local-prefix, 
                           tel-local-suffix, tel-extension, impp

...with some conformance rules, so that each section/subsection and 
section/subsection/context-type group has:

 - either up to one &quot;name&quot; or up to one of each of &quot;honorific-prefix&quot;,
   &quot;given-name&quot;, &quot;additional-name&quot;, &quot;family-name&quot;, &quot;honorific-suffix&quot;

 - up to one &quot;organisation-title&quot;
 - up to one &quot;organisation&quot;

 - either one &quot;street-address&quot;, or one &quot;address-line1&quot;
 - up to one &quot;address-line2&quot;, but only if there is an &quot;address-line1&quot;
 - up to one &quot;address-line3&quot;, but only if there is an &quot;address-line2&quot;

 - up to one of each of &quot;locality&quot;, &quot;region&quot;, &quot;country&quot;, &quot;postal-code&quot;

 - either up to one &quot;cc-name&quot; or up to one of each of &quot;cc-given-name&quot;, 
   &quot;cc-additional-name&quot;, &quot;cc-family-name&quot;

 - up to one &quot;cc-number&quot;

 - either up to one &quot;cc-exp&quot; or up to one each of &quot;cc-exp-month&quot; and 
   &quot;cc-exp-year&quot;

 - up to one &quot;cc-csc&quot;

 - up to one &quot;language&quot;

 - either up to one &quot;bday&quot; or up to one each of &quot;bday-day&quot;, &quot;bday-month&quot;, 
   and &quot;bday-year&quot;

 - up to one &quot;sex&quot;
 - up to one &quot;url&quot;
 - up to one &quot;photo&quot;

 - up to one &quot;email&quot;

 - either up to one &quot;tel&quot; or up to one each of &quot;tel-country-code&quot; and 
   &quot;tel-national&quot;

 - if there is no &quot;tel&quot; and no &quot;tel-national&quot;, up to one each of: 
   &quot;tel-area-code&quot; and &quot;tel-local&quot;

 - if there is no &quot;tel&quot;, no &quot;tel-national&quot;, and no &quot;tel-local&quot;: up to one 
   each of &quot;tel-local-prefix&quot; and &quot;tel-local-suffix&quot;

 - up to one &quot;tel-extension&quot;

 - up to one &quot;impp&quot;


The UA conformance criteria would be pretty minimal: for each input 
control with an autocomplete value that matches the above long forms, try 
to determine a value that matches the description of that value (the spec 
would have prose and a table describing what the values mean), and 
optionally offer to set the control to that value. The values must pass 
all the form control validation stuff, so e.g. if a control has 
maxlength=1 and autocomplete=&quot;shipping additional-name&quot; then the only 
sensible value to offer is the middle initial of the person to which the 
user is intending to ship the product.

The documentation in the spec would recommend particular input types for 
each field, and discourage the use of the decomposed forms, but there 
would not be any conformance criteria there.

Are there any common fields missing from the list above? Any categories 
other than &quot;billing&quot; and &quot;shipping&quot; that should be listed? Anything other 
than &quot;work&quot;, &quot;home&quot;, and &quot;fax&quot;? Should it be &quot;work-fax&quot; and &quot;home-fax&quot;? 
Should we instead have the fax-* fields to parallel the &quot;tel-*&quot; fields, so 
you can say you have a cell fax and so you can't say you have a fax e-mail 
or fax Jabber? Does it make sense to have home and cell e-mail accounts 
separately specifiable? Should we disallow addresses and contact details 
without the &quot;shipping&quot;/&quot;billing&quot; labels?
