</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the scary thing is that this way you can monetize foreign content by

</I>&gt;<i> never notice it at all when he doesn't sniff the URI with JavaScript,
</I>&gt;<i> because image files would have no referrer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My final approach to convict the abuser is based on the fact, that the
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript was dynamically loaded from my server and that I can write to
</I>&gt;<i> location.href. So I added this piece of code:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if (top.location.protocol === 'data:') {
</I>&gt;<i>     top.location.href = '<A HREF="http://example.com/trap/">http://example.com/trap/</A>';
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But even then the referrer will not be passed to the server. So my proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is that the data URI schema gets an exception on this security behavior.
</I>
The problem you outline is not directly tied to the solution you
present.  You can scrape a site and display it as your own without any
fancy tricks, just by downloading all the resources and hosting them
yourself.  This merely consumes a little more bandwidth for the
attacker, since they're hosting the images/etc themselves.

The correct solution to this kind of problem is legal - this is simple
copyright violation.

I'm not sure about the merits of your suggestion otherwise.  It's
reasonable to make data: pages same-origin with their parent when
they're contained within something, but it seems dodgy to make them
same-origin with their *contained* pages as well.  If not done
carefully, that could allow contained pages access to the data: page's
parent as well, or other cross-origin pages that the data: page is
containing.
