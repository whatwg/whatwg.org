</I>&gt;<i>    1. &quot;What state will the UndoManager be in when an exception happens?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    There may be transactions that were undone, cropped off by the transact()
</I>&gt;<i>    call, which per the spec are now unrecoverable.  Also, in the undo or redo
</I>&gt;<i>    cases, we might be in the middle of a merged transaction.  The spec says we
</I>&gt;<i>    can't call undo while we're unapplying a transaction... nor can we call
</I>&gt;<i>    redo.  So where will we be - both during the event dispatch and in the
</I>&gt;<i>    aftermath?
</I>&gt;<i>    2. &quot;What information about the exception will be included with the
</I>&gt;<i>    event - or with the UndoManager?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    3. &quot;If the UndoManager can recover somehow to a known good state
</I>&gt;<i>    without intervention, how can it indicate that - and possibly, what that
</I>&gt;<i>    good state would look like?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    4. &quot;If no recovery is completed, is it acceptable to mark the
</I>&gt;<i>    UndoManager in an error state and prevent further transactions from either
</I>&gt;<i>    happening or being recorded until both undo and redo stacks have been
</I>&gt;<i>    completely cleared?&quot;  (I'm thinking of a fatal error state, which can be
</I>&gt;<i>    recovered if you throw away all your history.)
</I>&gt;<i>    5. If there is a recovery by one event listener, should another event
</I>&gt;<i>    indicating that recovery be dispatched, so that earlier event listeners are
</I>&gt;<i>    aware of the new good state?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can write up a simple HTML + SVG document illustrating the UndoManager
</I>&gt;<i> Exception cases I can dream up, if anyone's interested.  There's four main
</I>&gt;<i> areas: during transact with no undone transactions, during undo where we
</I>&gt;<i> may be in the middle of a transaction group, during redo where we may be in
</I>&gt;<i> the middle of a transaction group, and during transact where some
</I>&gt;<i> transactions have been undone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For question 3, I would propose including an UndoManager mockup without
</I>&gt;<i> methods:  a static data representation of the default after-state.  Note
</I>&gt;<i> that it is perfectly okay in my opinion for the UndoManager to report &quot;I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot recover from this on my own,&quot; and not provide this mockup at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>For point 1, we should move step 2 (clear all redo) in the definition of
transact() to after step 3.

Points 2 and 5 makes me think that we should just propagate the exception
instead of firing an event. Whoever is catching the exception can take
appropriate actions then.

I don't understand what you mean in point 3.

What's the use case for point 4.

In general, I don't want to make the spec too complicated. I want to
provide the simplest API that gets job done. If there are some use cases
that require elaborate exception handling, then I would like to let
scripts/libraries provide such an API instead of baking it natively into
the spec. Of course, the native UndoManager should be flexible enough to
accommodate such needs.
