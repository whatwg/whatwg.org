I wish this were the case, however it does appear that websites,
are trying to control the platform.  They do this via their terms
of use and by twisting laws to suit them.  There was a recent case
in which Google took down a website that presented audio from
youtube videos, stating terms of use violations and copyright laws.
This service could well be viewed as a cloud web browser that was
presenting the content in a format requested by the users.  There
are many other terms of use that attempt to place significant
restrictions on use.  If it can ever be claimed that HTML is a
standard suited to delivery of digital content on the terms stated
by websites then it will be a significant loss.

Adding virtual browser app support would make it so easy to develop
and share customized web browsers that it would be near
impossible for websites to enforce restrictions.

It would also empower users of devices with a fixed browser to
still be able to have a web app that suits their needs.  It is
very easy for devices to lock out other native browsers, but if
custom browsers apps become popular then such devices would be
less attractive which would place pressure on them to open up.

The browser app need not have any more privilege than any other
webpage.  It can manage its own navigation tabs and history.  It
could even be of utility if it was unable to save files.  For
example, a browser app could implement privacy strategies to
minimize fingerprinting and tracking etc.

The Firefox OS project is developing an implementation and I
think this is a really exciting development that could empower
web users.  It would help web users use their browser in the
manner they want rather than as dictated by websites.

I will try to assist the development of this feature and to make
an implementation available as a modification to Firefox if it
does not get official support in Firefox.

There are some real concerns relating to the trust users place in
the browser apps.  However these apps could be curated as for
current add-ons.

cheers

Fred
