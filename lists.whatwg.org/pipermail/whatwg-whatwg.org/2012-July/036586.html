Surely that's going to set the attribute regardless of whether the 
attribute is nullable or whatnot. I mean, this always sets the attribute 
even if the attribute wasn't previously set:

   myElement.title = myElement.title


&gt;<i> More importantly,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   myOtherFrame.sandbox = myFrame.sandbox;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have weird surprising behavior if the attribute is something 
</I>&gt;<i> whose value sanely distinguishes between the various possible sandbox 
</I>&gt;<i> values.
</I>
I'm not sure I follow.


&gt;<i> &gt; We can certainly add an attribute to DOMSettableTokenList (or rather, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a descendant, for use specifically with iframe.sandbox) that does the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same as .hasAttribute(), e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     iframe.sandbox.present
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...or something, if that would help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would we also make the attribute readonly, then, and require that it be 
</I>&gt;<i> set via the token list?  Otherwise, it seems like the snippets above 
</I>&gt;<i> would still have pretty unexpected behavior.  But even then they might, 
</I>&gt;<i> since sets of readonly props are just silently ignored.  :(
</I>
I think remaining consistent with other non-boolean attributes, and thus 
having the setter always set the attribute, is fine.

Upon reflection, I haven't changed anything here. I don't see much value 
in making an exception to 'sandbox' here.
