<PRE>WHATWG,

The Responsive Images Community Group was recently asked to furnish a formal draft proposal for consideration by the HTML WG. I thought it best to post it here along with some details, where Ian Hickson has mentioned that he&#8217;ll be considering this issue again within a few days.

More and more it seems that it&#8217;s a waste of effort trying to retrofit the original srcset proposal to cover all the use cases of the original `picture` proposal. As we attempt to do so, the `srcset` msyntax grows more confusing, and shares an increasing amount of overlap with media queries &#8212; though with some obvious holes, for example: units other than `px`. To those ends, the Responsive Images Community Group has officially published a draft proposal based on Florian Rivoal&#8217;s proposed compromise ( <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-May/036160.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-May/036160.html</A> ) between the two markup patterns. In this way, `srcset` retains the purpose for which it was originally proposed: a terse, easily-implemented syntax for switching image sources based on the client resolution.

The draft proposal can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/wiki/Picture_Element_Proposal">http://www.w3.org/community/respimg/wiki/Picture_Element_Proposal</A>

Discussion with the HTML WG can be found here:
<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Jun/0113.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Jun/0113.html</A>

## Proposed Markup

&lt;picture alt=&quot;Description of image subject.&quot;&gt;
&lt;source srcset=&quot;small.jpg 1x, small-highres.jpg 2x&quot;&gt;
&lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 18em)&quot; srcset=&quot;med.jpg 1x, med-highres.jpg 2x&quot;&gt;
&lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 45em)&quot; srcset=&quot;large.jpg 1x, large-highres.jpg 2x&quot;&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Description of image subject.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;  

The chain of events followed by the above markup pattern are:

1. If the `picture` element is unsupported, the `img` contained therein is shown as fallback markup.
2. If picture is supported, use `media` attributes to determine which source element best suits the user&#8217;s viewport, following the same logic as `video`&#8217;s specced use of `media` attributes.
3. Once an appropriate source element has been selected, the `srcset` attribute determines which image source is best suited to the user&#8217;s screen resolution. If only a single resolution is necessary, the `src` attribute will function as expected, instead.

In terms of selecting a source element, this markup leverages all the strengths of media queries &#8212; the syntax created for this very purpose &#8212; to handle the &#8220;art direction&#8221; use case.

However, as has been detailed at length here and elsewhere, `device-pixel-ratio` media queries are poorly suited towards these decisions. As an author, using vendor-prefixed `min-device-pixel-ratio` media queries in the example above would involve a massive amount of text and twice as many source elements. This could get unwieldy for authors very quickly, a concern voiced numerous times in these ongoing discussions. Further, implementation of MQ-based resolution switching is far more difficult on the UA side: a very real concern.

Once we&#8217;ve used media queries to determine the most appropriate source element, srcset&#8217;s originally intended usage becomes absolutely ideal for our purposes: simply determining the appropriate image source for a user&#8217;s resolution.

It&#8217;s worth noting that this example is, in fact, the most convoluted this element can ever be. This pattern in no way precludes the use of srcset on an `img` tag for simply preforming resolution switching, nor does it preclude the use of `picture` as originally proposed for the &#8220;art direction&#8221;/screen size use cases, with `src` in source elements rather than `srcset`.

## Bandwidth

We cannot reliably make assumptions about bandwidth based on client capabilities &#8212; a MacBook Pro with a Retina display may be tethered to a 3G phone; a high-resolution mobile device is as likely to be connected to WiFi as it is an EDGE connection.

Based on previous discussion on the list, I think we&#8217;re largely in agreement that bandwidth decisions are best left to the browser. It would assume a great deal if authors were to make this decision for the users. It would add a point of failure: we would be taking the bandwidth information afforded us by the browser, and selectively applying that information. Some of us may do it wrong; some of us may find ourselves forced to make a decision as to whether we account for users with limited bandwidth or not. To not account for it would be, in my opinion, untenable &#8212; I&#8217;ve expressed that elsewhere, in no uncertain terms. The decision to download high vs. standard resolution images should be made by user agents, depending on the bandwidth available &#8212; and further, I believe there should be a user settable preference for &#8220;always use standard resolution images,&#8221; &#8220;always use high resolution images,&#8221; &#8221;download high resolution as bandwidth permits,&#8221; and so on.

In discussing the final markup pattern, we have to consider the above. Somewhere, that markup is going to contain a suggestion, rather than an imperative. I think `srcset` affords us that opportunity: a new syntax _designed_ to be treated as such. I wouldn&#8217;t want to introduce that sort of variance to the media query spec &#8212; a syntax long established as a set of absolutes.

It seems `srcset` won&#8217;t be going anywhere, and that&#8217;s not an indictment. There is a time and a place for `srcset`, and I feel that place is resolution switching &#8212; as it was originally intended. Our best efforts to bring srcset closer in-line with the originally proposed picture element only stand to leave us with a siloed microsyntax that inconsistently serves the purpose of media queries. With that comes further opportunity for errors by implementors and authors alike &#8212; countless new potential points of failure.

## Updated Polyfill

In order to better wrap my head around this pattern, I&#8217;ve updated Scott Jehl&#8217;s Picturefill to make use of the proposed syntax. The source code is available on GitHub ( <A HREF="https://github.com/Wilto/picturefill-proposal/">https://github.com/Wilto/picturefill-proposal/</A> ), and I&#8217;ve posted a demo ( <A HREF="http://wil.to/picturefill/">http://wil.to/picturefill/</A> ) as well.

Thank you for your ongoing consideration, sincerely. I look forward to finally putting this issue to rest.

Mat Marquis
