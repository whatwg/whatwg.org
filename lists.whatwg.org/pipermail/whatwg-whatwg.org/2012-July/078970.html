<PRE>Le 25/07/2012 15:32, Bronislav Klu&#269;ka a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> And my last remark: I hope major browser vendors will chose to follow 
</I>&gt;<i> the same path, the same implementation of tasks, but not all major 
</I>&gt;<i> vendors are part of WHATWG (as far as I know), and if some choose to 
</I>&gt;<i> follow W3C and some different WHATWG drafts of the same task, what 
</I>&gt;<i> would happen?
</I>Interesting question...

&gt;<i> (Thou I do not think it actually will happen). To put it simply, it 
</I>&gt;<i> does not matter, what either W3C or WHATWG codify, what matter is, 
</I>&gt;<i> what browsers implement - it was always about vendors...
</I>... which you answer yourself to.
If the WHATWG continue to work in ways that we know (including codifying 
de facto standards to preserve content backward compatibility), then no 
matter what browsers will to do (follow one spec or several or none), 
the end result is that the WHATWG will codify what works.
As an example, they spec'ed innerHTML which was first implemented in IE 
(and followed by all others) which isn't part of the WHATWG. There are 
probably dozens of these examples.

&gt;<i> W3C forgot that.
</I>Who did? I mean, the actual people. Who should we be talking to to 
convince them that web standards are more the consequence of an 
implementation rather than the opposite (regardless of whether this is a 
good situation or not)?
