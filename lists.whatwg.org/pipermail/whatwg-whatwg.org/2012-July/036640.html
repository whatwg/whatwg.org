</I>
I've fixed the text so that those methods now always return 96dpi data.


&gt;<i> I'd like to propose the addition of a backingStorePixelRatio property to

</I>&gt;<i> ratio of device pixels to CSS pixels, ctx.backingStorePixelRatio would 
</I>&gt;<i> express the ratio of backing store pixels to CSS pixels. This allows 
</I>&gt;<i> developers to easily branch to handle different backing store scale 
</I>&gt;<i> factors.
</I>
I've added window.screen.canvasResolution which returns the resolution 
that is being used for 2D canvases created during the current task.


&gt;<i> Additionally, I think the existing {create,get,put}ImageData API needs 
</I>&gt;<i> to be defined to be in terms of CSS pixels, since that's what existing 
</I>&gt;<i> content assumes.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> I propose the addition of a new set of methods for working directly with 
</I>&gt;<i> backing store image data. (New methods are easier to feature detect than 
</I>&gt;<i> adding optional arguments to the existing methods.) At the moment I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> calling these {create,get,put}ImageDataHD, but I'm not wedded to the 
</I>&gt;<i> names. (Nor do I want to bikeshed them.)
</I>
Done.

I've also added toDataURLHD and toBlobHD.

I haven't done this, because it would make the API rather weird. But I am 
happy to do it if people think the API weirdness is a cost worth paying.

Note that technically getImageData() doesn't have to block -- it's array 
access on ImageData that has to block. It would be possible to implement 
getImageData() in such a way that the ImageData object is lazily filled. 
You'd end up blocking later if the author really needed the data, but it's 
possible to write code that doesn't block (though you wouldn't necessarily 
know how long to wait, I guess).

Having the operations not occur in order would make the API quite 
difficult to use, so if that's not an option, I don't think it's worth it.

I think it depends how strong the benefits are. In this particular case, I 
tend to agree that the benefits aren't really worth tying them together, 
and possibly not worth providing the async model as a separate API at all.

Maybe we could have an attribute on ImageData that says whether an array 
index read would have to block on getting the data or whether it's ready, 
maybe coupled with an event that says when it's ready?
