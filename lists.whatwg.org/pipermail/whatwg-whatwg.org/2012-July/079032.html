Thanks. I learned a lot from this thread.

Just now took myself in writing the following in a Web page: &quot;Regarding 
the last list-item, then &#8230;&quot;. And then I realized that that &quot;last 
list-item&quot; occurred inside a &lt;ul&gt; list. Which meant that I had to (or 
at least I did) change the list from &lt;ul&gt; to &lt;ol&gt;. I also replaced the 
numerical list-item numbering with circles, to signify that the items 
was not numbered.

In fact, I frequently deal with texts where there is &quot;homework items&quot; 
where each homework item contains one or more sub-items. For these 
sub-items, I use &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#8230;&lt;li&gt;&#8230;&lt;/ol&gt; &#8212; which seems logical as long as 
there more than one sub-item. But what - at least for the time being - 
there is only one sub-item? I want the sub-item to have a bullet, or 
similar, to signify that it is a sub-item. I don't want a number. At 
the same time, there is no principal difference between that lone 
sub-item and the multiple sub-items in the nearby homework item.

So one option that comes to mind is to do the following, in order to be 
certain that sole-items have a different style:
	ol&gt;li:first-child:last-child {list-style-type:circle}

Should I want to add one item more, then I automatically get numbering.

What strikes me is that I almost never would like to use &lt;ul&gt; anymore. 
Only when I would like to explicitly say that the meaning of this 
document does not change whichever way you list the list-items, only 
then would I pick &lt;ul&gt;.

Which makes me wonder: Why is not value=&quot;&lt;number&gt;&quot; allowed for &lt;li&gt; 
inside &lt;ul&gt;? E.g. I might want to add accidental numbers to the 
list-items while at the same time also wanting to say that the page 
does not change meaning whichever way you order the items?

I also wonder: Would it not make sense to advice, when uncertain about 
whether order is significant, advice authors to pick &lt;ol&gt; over &lt;ul&gt;? 
For instance the sub-items of our homework items: Since the order of 
the sub-items often risks becoming significant, it seems smart to pick 
&lt;ol&gt; and not &lt;ul&gt; - even if &lt;ul&gt; sometimes could work too.
