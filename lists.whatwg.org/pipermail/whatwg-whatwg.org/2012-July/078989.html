The practical problem with names is that we need to communicate what we 
are referring to, in an understandable manner.

&quot;HTML&quot; is far too broad, and &quot;Living Standard&quot; doesn't even say this is 
about HTML. &quot;HTML Living Standard&quot; would do I guess, even though it 
sounds more like a credo than a technical reference. I suppose &quot;WHATWG 
HTML&quot; might be used as a fairly neutral expression.

&gt;<i> As of the last time the W3C equivalent spec was updated, it was titled
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;HTML5&quot;, but you'd have to ask the W3C what their plans are.
</I>
&quot;HTML5&quot; has become a rather loose expression, so we may need to use a 
phrase like &quot;W3C HTML5&quot;, or maybe &quot;W3C HTML5 draft(s)&quot;, in contexts 
where the difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML might matter.
