</I>This goes to my &quot;Interesting question&quot;, I do understand the advantage of 
&quot;codifying supported convention&quot;, but in case of differences... And it's 
already happening (on vendor level... maybe not differences at the same 
task, but different approaches on similar tasks, decisions not to 
implement some parts of WebApp - but I guess it's inevitable).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> W3C forgot that.
</I>&gt;<i> Who did? I mean, the actual people. Who should we be talking to to 
</I>&gt;<i> convince them that web standards are more the consequence of an 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation rather than the opposite (regardless of whether this is

</I>I do not know who actually decided, that W3C will be inventor instead of 
codifier... It's like 14 years ago :). And I'm not in either group. Just 
remembering those times :) You should ask the people that were behind 
creation of WHATWG (there must have been a reason why some vendors, part 
of WG working on web tech, decided to leave and start their own project 
- there must have been someone opposing the idea of fast progress of 
HTML, there must have been someone trying to push XHTML2 at all costs, 
there must have been someone who though, that vendors opinion is 
irrelevant, or less important).

I was just looking at WHATWG wiki and there is nice sentence: &quot;In 
general the WHATWG will ensure that the normative content of the 
specifications (the requirements on authors and implementors) remains 
the same so long as the W3C group doesn't demonstrate any serious lapses 
in judgement.&quot;
