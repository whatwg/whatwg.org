I agree it shouldn't (and doesn't) dictate one. But it's crazy to not 
consider implementations at all when writing a spec. That way lies madness 
like requiring O(N^2) algorithms and solving the halting problem and all 
kinds of other disasters (all of which I've seen in real proposals).
 

&gt;<i> I also strongly object to having to update this hit testing bitmap 
</I>&gt;<i> and/or path set on drawing operations like clearRect(). That will 
</I>&gt;<i> potentially hurt performance.
</I>
How so? If it's a path set, you just add a rectangle (you can keep the 
list of shapes down by occasionally running pruning algorithms to remove 
shapes entirely contained by later ones). If it's a bitmap, it's even 
easier; you just wipe the rectangle in the bitmap.


&gt;<i> I think its up to the author to manage their set of paths appropriately, 
</I>&gt;<i> independently from the drawing operations.
</I>
Having the drawing mechanism work in a tightly integrated fashion with the 
region code IMHO helps authors avoid bugs. You don't have to track which 
regions you've defined, you just make sure to draw the regions while 
you're drawing the paths and it all Just Works. Not having to track the 
regions is the entire point of how this API was designed -- it's also the 
main differentiating factor between this API's design and the design of 
hit testing in retained-mode APIs such as SVG.
