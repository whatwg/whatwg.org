</I>
Actually the reason this thread hasn't gone anywhere is that there seems 
to only be implementer interest from Chrome.

See: <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/New_Features_Awaiting_Implementation_Interest">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/New_Features_Awaiting_Implementation_Interest</A>


&gt;<i> 1) This would make it possible to write JavaScript libraries that 
</I>&gt;<i> seamlessly scan the current page for &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; and add 
</I>&gt;<i> integration with Dropbox / Google Drive / Sky Drive etc. I claim that 
</I>&gt;<i> changing the &lt;input&gt; value is the easiest and most robust method of 
</I>&gt;<i> achieving this without requiring changes to the main application code. 
</I>&gt;<i> Asides from providing an easy path for developers to integrate online 
</I>&gt;<i> storage services into their apps, this change would make it easy to 
</I>&gt;<i> write bookmarklets / browser extensions that add this functionality to 
</I>&gt;<i> any Web application.
</I>
It seems like this use case would be better handled by having the sites 
offer an API to the browser, similar to Web Intents, for picking a file. 
That way you wouldn't need to update each site -- every site would support 
all the drive systems you use.


&gt;<i> 2) If I can set the files attribute of an &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;, I can 
</I>&gt;<i> write unit tests for any code that deals with such an &lt;input&gt;, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> XHR uploads. Tested code is less likely to break down as it is 
</I>&gt;<i> maintained, so it makes for a better Web.
</I>
That's an interesting use case, indeed.


&gt;<i> 3) Browser extensions / bookmarklets could easily filter files being 
</I>&gt;<i> uploaded. For example, an extension could automatically resize pictures 
</I>&gt;<i> larger than a certain threshold by rendering them to an off-screen 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;canvas&gt;. As another example, an extension could detect when huge files 
</I>&gt;<i> are uploaded to a Web mail client or forum, automatically upload them to 
</I>&gt;<i> Dropbox / Google Drive / Sky Drive, and replace them in the &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; with tiny &quot;.url&quot; files pointing to the real files.
</I>
In general, browser extensions don't have to be handled by Web standard 
APIs, so I'm not sure that's a compelling use case.


&gt;<i> With these applications in mind, I don't think FileList needs to accept 
</I>&gt;<i> Blobs. Instead, there should be an easy way to build a File out of a 
</I>&gt;<i> Blob and a file name. This capability seems to have been lost when 
</I>&gt;<i> BlobBuilder was deprecated by the Blob constructor.
</I>
There are places where FileList definitely needs to be readonly, so I 
don't think it makes sense to make it globally writable. but there could 
be a MutableFileList or something. That feedback should be sent to the 
list mentioned at the top of the File API spec.
