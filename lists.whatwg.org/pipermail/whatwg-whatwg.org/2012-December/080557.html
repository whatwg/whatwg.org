Thank you very much for explaining!

I can file a bug against Firefox, and argue for it. I think I would
have an easier time making an argument if I knew how the API should
look like. Can you please give me a hint as to which variant you'd be
more likely to agree with? Mutable FileLists vs a  way to put together
a new FileList + writable files attribute on &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;? File
constructor taking a Blob + name vs having Blobs in a FileList?

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) This would make it possible to write JavaScript libraries that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seamlessly scan the current page for &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; and add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integration with Dropbox / Google Drive / Sky Drive etc. I claim that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing the &lt;input&gt; value is the easiest and most robust method of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> achieving this without requiring changes to the main application code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Asides from providing an easy path for developers to integrate online
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> storage services into their apps, this change would make it easy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write bookmarklets / browser extensions that add this functionality to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any Web application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like this use case would be better handled by having the sites
</I>&gt;<i> offer an API to the browser, similar to Web Intents, for picking a file.
</I>&gt;<i> That way you wouldn't need to update each site -- every site would support
</I>&gt;<i> all the drive systems you use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, but that approach would require deeper application changes. I
think that adding a couple of &lt;script&gt; tags next to an existing &lt;input
type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; is easier to implement.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) If I can set the files attribute of an &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;, I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write unit tests for any code that deals with such an &lt;input&gt;, such as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XHR uploads. Tested code is less likely to break down as it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintained, so it makes for a better Web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's an interesting use case, indeed.
</I>
Thank you! In general, read-only APIs make testing really hard :(

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Browser extensions / bookmarklets could easily filter files being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uploaded. For example, an extension could automatically resize pictures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> larger than a certain threshold by rendering them to an off-screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;canvas&gt;. As another example, an extension could detect when huge files
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are uploaded to a Web mail client or forum, automatically upload them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dropbox / Google Drive / Sky Drive, and replace them in the &lt;input
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; with tiny &quot;.url&quot; files pointing to the real files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, browser extensions don't have to be handled by Web standard
</I>&gt;<i> APIs, so I'm not sure that's a compelling use case.
</I>
I think it would be useful to have a drop-in JS library that can
perform image resizing on the fly without requiring XHR-based form
submission.

&gt;&gt;<i> With these applications in mind, I don't think FileList needs to accept
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blobs. Instead, there should be an easy way to build a File out of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blob and a file name. This capability seems to have been lost when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BlobBuilder was deprecated by the Blob constructor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are places where FileList definitely needs to be readonly, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it makes sense to make it globally writable. but there could
</I>&gt;<i> be a MutableFileList or something. That feedback should be sent to the
</I>&gt;<i> list mentioned at the top of the File API spec.
</I>
FileList doesn't have to be mutable if there is a FileList constructor
that accepts File instances, or if the files attribute of &lt;input
type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; accepts an array of File instances and converts it into a
FileList.

I will start a discussion on the <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">public-webapps at w3.org.</A> For reference,
they seem to be in favor of a File constructor.

Thank you very much for your consideration,
