I think it makes sense, but I'd really rather not get into the nitty 
gritty of the maths if it can at all be avoided. I've tried to do as you 
describe, though.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can create a new Path, then add another Path to it while applying

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it is possible. But there are two reasons why I think that it still 
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense to use a transform function. First it seems natural to have 
</I>&gt;<i> a transform on Path object, like the CanvasRenderingContext2D already 
</I>&gt;<i> has. Both share a lot of functions, why disallow it for transforms?
</I>
The main reason I didn't add it to Path is because it led to a bit of 
confusion in terms of what the transform applied to. Does it apply when 
you add points _to_ the path? Does it apply when you draw the path on 
another path or the canvas? Also, one of the more confusing aspects of the 
canvas API is that you can change the coordinate space while adding lines 
to the path, and we had a whole era wherein implemenations and the spec 
were confused as to what exactly happened when (did the points get 
transformed? Did the transform apply only when you stroke? etc).

So in the new API I side-stepped the whole problem.


&gt;<i> Second, the solution that you mention requires a copy operation. A lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of libraries would create a new path, add the other path and apply the 
</I>&gt;<i> transform afterwards. Seems unnecessary for me.
</I>
I don't really follow. Can you elaborate?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In practice you're pretty much always going to have a context around

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Path object transformed as per the transform on the canvas, generally 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; speaking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessarily. The path object makes sense outside of canvas as well.

</I>
Sure, but with SVG you don't need to know if a point is in a path, because 
the events get dispatched to the right path by the UA.


&gt;<i> Maybe if there was a 'currentpath' property on the 2d context, you can

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so:
</I>&gt;<i>   myContext.currentpath.isPointInPath(...)
</I>
I don't really see what problem this solves.


&gt;<i> Most of the time you don't want to know if a point falls in the current 
</I>&gt;<i> path in the canvas. You want to know after you finish drawing and the

</I>&gt;<i> canvas is long gone (unless you want to go through the trouble of 
</I>&gt;<i> redrawing everything).
</I>
Sure, and for that we have the hit region API.


&gt;<i> I agree with Ian that there shouldn't be a method that changes the current

</I>&gt;<i> In addition, the path API's could be simplified since you can take out all

Can you elaborate on the use case for this? Why would you transform a path 
without immediately using it somewhere?

It is definitely possible, but before we add anything, we must know what 
the use cases are so that we can evaluate if this is the best solution.

CanvasRenderingContext2D has a path-related API because that's what has

Why not just draw the path to a Path?

I'd rather not add API surface just for transitory needs.

It's always possible for constraints to change; I was just disagreeing 
with your statement above regarding what was an option and what was not.


&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing can quite mess up an API or language like changing

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its life. You end up with languages that feel like they have multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personality disorder, and it ends up being much harder to learn the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language than if it was consistent with itself but overall more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated than possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes this is the price of backwards compatibility.
</I>
Yes, but it's a _very_ high price, rarely worth the cost. In particular, 
it _doesn't_ result in a simpler language, so if simplicity is the goal, 
then this is not the way to do it.


&gt;<i> &gt; That is, a language that has complexity 10 throughout is easier to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learn and use than a language that is half complexity 10 and half 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity 1. This is a lesson we have learnt many times on the Web, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not least of which with HTML, which has lurched in many directions 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over its lifetime, leaving authors highly frustrated and confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we just add new segments and don't mess up the existing syntax. 
</I>&gt;<i> Authors have the freedom to choose between the path syntax they want.
</I>
&quot;Authors have the freedom to choose between the path syntax they want&quot; is 
exactly the mistake I'm talking about. Adding more flexibility doesn't 
make things simpler, it makes things more complex. For example, authors 
have to learn everything, because they might have to maintain stuff 
written by someone who used the part of the API you'd rather were ignored.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; To be honest it seems very confusing to me that Canvas has arc() and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ellipse() but no ellipseTo() as pendant to ellipse().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ellipse() exists only because arc() already had optional arguments and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the resulting API had arc() been extended to support ellipse()'s use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case would have been to have the radii arguments split or to have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optional arguments in the middle, which is IMHO even worse than adding 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another method. It's an unfortunate situation, certainly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe you that this wash't your intention initially, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistency is the naming now. Canvas has arc and ellipse on the one 
</I>&gt;<i> side and just arcTo on the other side.
</I>
Yes, as I said, it's an unfortunate situation.

</I>
Oh it _absolutely_ makes sense to &quot;act against wishes of web authors&quot; in 
some situations. Authors often do not realise what they want from 
languages, much like users don't realise what they want from software, or 
people who live in houses don't realise what they want from architecture, 
or people who wat don't realise what they want from food.

It's the job of the language designer / interaction designer / architect / 
cook to provide the people with what they actually want even when they 
don't realise that they want it.

(Nothing illustrates this better than usability studies, where users will 
ask for the most inane of features and yet, when presented with well- 
designed features that address their underlying use cases, respond very 
positively and indicate that that is exactly what they wanted all along.)


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As such, we're requesting that the canvas path API change to be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the canvas API is adequately consistent with itself given

I think the two have started with very different design philosophies and

They're not. In each case, if there are legitimate reasons that you could

If you have to write a check for zero, that assumes it can legitimately

That's a reasonable use case. I've made the image stuff do nothing when

I've updated drawImage() -- it just aborts silently if the source 
dimensions are zero (in particular, it doesn't paint anything, so no 
shadows end up visible, and the composition operator doesn't blow away the 
canvas as it would for a very small non-zero rectangle -- I couldn't work 
out exactly what should happen if we did actually try to render 
somethign). I haven't changed ImageBitmap or ImageData, not sure what to 
do with those. If you could elaborate on what cases end up with zeroes in 
those cases, I can figure out what it would make sense to do.

Theoretically the filtering algorithm is undefined, so yes, in theory it

It's certainly suboptimal, I agree. These are just the options that one 
has to do now in the absence of a better solution.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Disabling image smoothing will increase artefacts, that's kind of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point. :-) Having said that, I don't really see what that test case is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; demonstrating. Can you elaborate?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the test case is demonstrating the behavior I argue correct, the 
</I>&gt;<i> drawn images in the canvas at the bottom will not show any red pixels. 
</I>&gt;<i> Another arguably correct approach would be for red pixels only to appear 
</I>&gt;<i> with image smoothing enabled. It doesn't make sense even given the 
</I>&gt;<i> current spec for red pixels to appear when smoothing is disabled - if 
</I>&gt;<i> you're drawing with nearest neighbor sampling, the red pixels that 
</I>&gt;<i> appear in the current test case (in Firefox on Windows, at least) can 
</I>&gt;<i> only be there if partial pixels are being rendered, which shouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> possible using nearest neighbor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An acceptable compromise in this case, IMO, would be to at least require 
</I>&gt;<i> that pixels from outside the source rectangle are not read if image 
</I>&gt;<i> smoothing is disabled.
</I>
I haven't changed the spec here. I don't really want to specify the 
filtering algorithms beyond what we've already done; this is all supposed 
to be a quality-of-implementation issue.


&gt;<i> &gt; The reason to prefer the current behaviour is if you want to just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update a small part of an image. For example, if you draw a bit photo, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then draw text over it, then want to remove the text by just drawing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the photo over where the text was but not redrawing the whole thing. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we clamped to source rectangle, we'd get artefacts in this case 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that couldn't be worked around (unlike the problems with scaling 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sprites, which can be worked around, albeit in a suboptimal fashion).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using a clip seems like the right way to do that.
</I>
It's a lot more expensive.

I'm sure we will in due course. Probably not an extra optional argument 
though, since it's unclear where you'd put it (requiring all 9 other 
arguments each time seems excessive).

Why would it be expensive?

If we did a method, I'd probably go for drawSprite().


&gt;<i> This gives me another idea: we could just have a new Image constructor

That's an interesting option, indeed.

I've done this, using ImageBitmap.

createImageBitmap accepts the following:

   &lt;img&gt;
   &lt;video&gt;
   &lt;canvas&gt;
   Blob
   ImageData
   CanvasRenderingContext2D
   ImageBitmap

This is entirely a UA optimisation / quality of implementation decision.


&gt;<i> Will creating the subregion imply a copy and the associated garbage

</I>
Also a UA issue.


&gt;<i> I think what you'd want here is for it to be a reference to the

</I>&gt;<i> a subregion of a canvas, when the canvas changes the subregion changes 
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>
Hm, interesting. That's not what I specced. What would the use case be?

ImageBitmap is intended to be immutable once created, so that you can 
safely pass it around across workers.


&gt;<i> How would a new overload of the Image constructor be feature-detected in JS?
</I>
I used createImageBitmap(), so hopefully all implementations will do a 
full implementation of this feature all at once, so it's either there or 
not.


&gt;<i> If this becomes the correct way to solve this problem, what happens to 
</I>&gt;<i> existing implementations that provided alternative sampling behavior 
</I>&gt;<i> (like Chrome)? Will they get changed to match the spec, breaking apps 
</I>&gt;<i> until the new Image constructor is rolled out?
</I>
Hopefully...


&gt;<i> Also, the more I think about it, the more the garbage collection impact 
</I>&gt;<i> of invoking a constructor for every blit seems like a potential problem.
</I>
You only need to call the constructors when you create your sprites, not 
continually.


&gt;<i> Even in generational GCs like V8, allocating a bunch of objects isn't

</I>&gt;<i> particular source rectangle used when drawing.
</I>
Could you elaborate on this?

It's more a matter of who wants to use it than who implemented it, but 
thanks, that's useful information also.
