<PRE>
I've just checked in a somewhat large redesign of how context menus work 
in HTML. It's much more similar, though not identical, to what Firefox 
implements. It drops the &lt;command&gt; element, adds a &lt;menuitem&gt; element,
introduces a &lt;button type=menu&gt; feature, and drops &lt;menu type=toolbar&gt;.

High-level overview:

* There's now three features of relevance here:

   1. Toolbars.

   2. Context menus.

   3. Pop-up menu buttons.

* Toolbars are nothing more than a &lt;div&gt; with the element name &lt;menu&gt;. 
There's no magic at all, no special content model, it's all CSS for 
styling, you use regular form controls to fill the toolbar.

* Context menus and pop-up menu button menus use &lt;menu type=popup&gt;. The 
only children allowed for these elements are &lt;menuitem&gt;, &lt;hr&gt; for 
separators, and &lt;menu label=&quot;&quot;&gt; for submenus.

* &lt;menu type=menu menu=&quot;id&quot;&gt; &lt;menu type=popup id=&quot;id&quot;&gt; defines a pop-up 
menu button.

* &lt;menuitem&gt; has all the stuff that &lt;command&gt; used to have, including 
&lt;menuitem command=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; to point to another element (e.g. an &lt;a href&gt;, 
&lt;button&gt;, &lt;option&gt;, etc) and accesskey=&quot;&quot;.

* &lt;menuitem&gt; is void (requires parser changes).

* &lt;command&gt; is entirely gone. (Actually, I renamed &lt;command&gt; to &lt;menuitem&gt; 
and made it so it's only allowed in &lt;menu&gt;.)

I would love input from implementors regarding whether this is something 
they are more interested in implementing than what came before.

I've made the type=toolbar state be a regular &lt;div&gt;-like context. Authors 
are on their own again for making toolbars for now.

</I>
I've dramatically simplified this algorithm. It now only consists of 
&lt;menu&gt;, &lt;menuitem&gt;, and &lt;hr&gt;.

(We can drop &lt;hr&gt; if people don't like that; it's actually redundant with 
the handling of &lt;menu&gt; without a label.)

</I>
I haven't got a solution for drop-down button styling. The &lt;menu&gt; in this 
scenario is display:none, so I can't get any styles out of it to affect 
the styling of the drop-down menu. I'm open to suggestions for how to fix 
this; maybe the solution is to have something like:

   display: compute-style-but-do-not-render-anything-in-flow

I don't think a pile of CSS should be needed for this, though, that's the

Ideally you should just have to describe your toolbar or context menu in 
HTML and be done with it.


&gt;<i> * A mechanism (most probably an attribute + a CSS pseudo-class, or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> even recycling :hover) to show click-based menu bars some script-less love.
</I>
Traditional menu _bars_ are not something that I've solved with this 
update (specifically, the part where you click on one menu bar's label and 
then hover over to another label and the other menu opens). It's not 
entirely clear to me that freestanding menu bars are an especially 
important user interface widget in the context of a Web page or Web app, 
but if so, we should indeed address it.

The simplest way of doing it that I can see would be a new type of &lt;menu&gt;:

   &lt;menu type=menubar&gt;
    &lt;menu label=&quot;File&quot;&gt;
     &lt;menuitem ...&gt;
    &lt;/menu&gt;
    &lt;menu label=&quot;Edit&quot;&gt;
     &lt;menuitem ...&gt;
    &lt;/menu&gt;
   &lt;/menu&gt;

Are any browser vendors interested in implementing something like this?


&gt;<i> * A mechanism to deal with context menus in a sane way. It all boils 
</I>&gt;<i> down to UA's natively handling the showing and dismissing of the menus; 
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe enabling a mechanism to define a default (did you noticed the

</I>&gt;<i> double-clicking instead of right-clicking does invoke it, skipping the 
</I>&gt;<i> whole &quot;show the menu&quot; step! ). That would cause it to work with any 
</I>&gt;<i> native method the browser or platform already supports for displaying 
</I>&gt;<i> context menus.
</I>
This is supported now (including the default styling thing, though in the 
spec model that's just a hint, you have to implement the default behaviour 
yourself if you want that to actually happen).


&gt;<i> As a user, I would hope any context menu implementation grants me the 
</I>&gt;<i> ultimate control on which menu is used (native vs. app-provided).
</I>
The browser leaves that up to the UA at the moment, but see discussion 
below.

</I>
As far as I can tell the spec differs in the following ways from what 
Gecko does now (based on my understanding of what Gecko does, not on 
thorough tests):

 - &lt;menuitem command=&quot;&quot;&gt; is not supported in Gecko.
   This is just a missing feature, not a big deal. I've heard a lot of 
   requests for the indirection feature so I've left that in the spec, but 
   if it never gets implemented I'll eventually drop it.

 - &lt;menu type=popup&gt; is implemented as &lt;menu type=context&gt; in Gecko.
   This is an unfortunate incompatibility. I renamed &quot;context&quot; to &quot;popup&quot; 
   because it doesn't make sense to have &lt;button type=menu menu=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
   pointing at a &lt;menu type=context&gt; since then it's not a context menu 
   but a drop-down menu. Since both context menus and drop-down menus are 
   also called &quot;pop-up menus&quot; I went with &quot;popup&quot;. If there's too much 
   content depending on type=context let me know and I'll change it back.

 - Gecko doesn't support &lt;hr&gt;.
   I can drop this from the spec if people think it's not a good idea.
   You can do the same thing using nested unlabeled &lt;menu&gt;s (Gecko does 
   support that). It's a bit weird to require the nested elements in 
   simple cases, which is why I've left &lt;hr&gt; in for now.

 - Gecko's parser doesn't treat &lt;menuitem&gt; as a void element.
   I think we should treat it as void because otherwise it's really 
   verbose.

 - Gecko uses the first text node of the &lt;menuitem&gt; element as a label if 
   there's no label=&quot;&quot; attribute.
   I don't see much point supporting this, especially if we make it void.

 - Gecko doesn't support contextmenu=&quot;&quot; pointing at a &lt;menu&gt; child of a 
   &lt;menu type=context&gt; (popup, in spec).
   Per the spec now, the child would be a valid target of contextmenu=&quot;&quot; 
   since its type=&quot;&quot; defaults to popup if its parent is a popup &lt;menu&gt;.
   This is more of a side-effect of other stuff, not a big deal.

 - Gecko doesn't drop submenus with no label (it does drop items with no 
   label, at least in most cases, and seems to strip separators as the 
   spec suggests).
   This just looks like a minor issue in Gecko.

 - Gecko doesn't support &lt;button type=menu menu=&quot;&quot;&gt;.
   It's now as of today, so that's not surprising.


&gt;<i> In Gecko MenuItem inherits Command, so it has type, label, icon etc.

Done.

Not showing the browser's own context menu items is a hurtful user 
experience as well; indeed, possibly a worse one.

However, the spec does allow the user agent to not add its own items if 
that is considered better. Browsers are encouraged to provide an override 
if they do that (e.g. shift-click brings up the full menu).

I'm not sure I really agree with the premise of the bug. It points to this 
image as a reason for not showing UA context menu items:

...but that to me is a perfect example of why this is a misfeature. 
Where's &quot;Inspect Element&quot;, for example?

I think it would make sense for browsers to skip the less important menu 
items (those that are accessible via the menus, for instance) when showing 
a context menu that the author is providing. (But then, I think it would 
make sense to not show those ever.) But for things that are only sanely
accessible via the context menu, I don't see why we'd drop them.

Indeed.

I don't understand why the page should ever be able to remove items that

The above information would still be helpful in determining whether we 
should add a &quot;nodefault&quot;-like feature to HTML menus. Hopefully with the 
new changes there will be more widespread implementations and we will be 
able to get this information.
