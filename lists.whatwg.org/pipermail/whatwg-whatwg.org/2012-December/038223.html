<PRE>== Use case ==

Load and execute script as quickly as possible.

== Discussion ==

Currently, there are a number of ways to load a script from the
network and execute it, but none of them will actually load and
execute the script as fast as physically possible.  Consider the
following markup:

&lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

In this case, the user agent will wait until it receives the last byte
of script.js from the network before executing the first byte of
script.js.  In principle, the user agent could finish executing
script.js sooner if it could overlap some of the execution time with
some of the network latency, for example by executing a chunk of the
script while waiting for the bytes for the next chunk to arrive from
the network.

Unfortunately, without additional information, the user agent doesn't
know where &quot;safe&quot; chunk boundaries are located.  Picking an arbitrary
byte boundary is likely to cause a syntax error, and even picking an
arbitrary JavaScript statement boundary will change the semantics of
the script.  The user agent needs some sort of signal from the author
to know where the safe chunk boundaries are located.

== Workarounds ==

The simplest work around is to break your script into several pieces:

&lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script-part1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script-part2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script-part3.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Now, script-part1.js will execute before the user agent has received
the last byte of script-part3.js.  Unfortunately, this approach does
not make efficient use of the network.  Specifically, if the three
parts are retrieved from the network in parallel, then the user agent
might receive a byte from script-part3.js before receiving all the
bytes of script-part1.js, wasting network bandwidth (because the bytes
from script-part3.js are not useful until all of script-part1.js is
received an executed).

A more sophisticated workaround is to use an &lt;iframe&gt; element rather
than a &lt;script&gt; element to load the script:

&lt;iframe src=&quot;path/to/script-in-markup.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

In this approach, script-in-markup.html is the following HTML:

&lt;script&gt;
[... text of script-part1.js ...]
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
[... text of script-part2.js ...]
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
[... text of script-part3.js ...]
&lt;/script&gt;

Now the bytes of the script are retrieved from the network in the
proper order (making efficient use of bandwidth) and the user agent
can overlap execution of the script with network latency (because the
&lt;script&gt; tags delineate the safe chunks).

This approach is used in production web applications, including Gmail,
to load and execute script as quickly as possible.  If you inspect a
running copy of Gmail, you can find this frame---it's the one with ID
&quot;js_frame&quot;.

Unfortunately, this approach as a number of disadvantages:

(1) Creating an extra &lt;iframe&gt; for loading JavaScript is not resource
efficient.  The user agent needs to create a number of extra data
structures and an extra JavaScript environment, which wastes time as
well as memory.

(2) Authors need to write their scripts with the understanding that
the primary callers of their code will do so from another frame.  For
example, the instanceof operator might not work as expected if they
ask whether an object from the caller (i.e., from the parent frame) is
an instance of a constructor from the callee's environment (i.e., from
the child frame).

(3) This approach requires the author who loads the script to use
different syntax than normally used for loading script.  For example,
this prevents this technique from being applied to the JavaScript
libraries that Google hosts (as described by
&lt;<A HREF="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/</A>&gt;).

== Proposal ==

The &lt;script&gt; element should support multipart/mixed.

== Details ===

The main ingredient that we're missing is a way for the author to
signal to the user agent which chunks of scripts are safe to execute
in parallel with loading subsequent chunks from the network.
Fortunately, the web platform already has a mechanism for breaking a
single HTTP response body into chunks that are processed sequentially:
multipart/mixed.

For example, if an HTTP server provides a multipart/mixed response to
a request for an image, the &lt;img&gt; element will display each part of
the response in sequence, animating the image.  Similarly, if an HTTP
server provides a multipart/mixed response to a request for an HTML
document, the user agent will display each part of the response
sequentially.

One way to address this use case is to add multipart/mixed support to
the &lt;script&gt; element.  Upon receiving a multipart/mixed response to a
request for a script, the &lt;script&gt; element must execute each part of
the response as they become available.  This behavior appears to be
consistent with the definition of multipart/mixed
&lt;<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-5.1.3">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-5.1.3</A>&gt;.

To load and execute a script as quickly as possible, the author would
use the following markup:

&lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

The HTTP server would then break script.js into chunks that are safe
to execute sequentially and provide each chunk as a separate MIME part
in a multipart/mixed response.
