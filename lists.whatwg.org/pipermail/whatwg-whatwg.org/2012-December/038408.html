Per the spec, calls that would create a new browsing context are blocked 
unless called from the handler of a trusted 'click' event. (The spec also 
allows blocking in some other cases, and requires blocking in some sandbox 
cases, but those aren't popup-blocking-related.)

I don't know if the spec is overly strict here; maybe it should also be 
possible on other trusted events e.g. mousedown or keydown?


&gt;<i> 2) About the third argument, is there a somewhat interoperable overlap

</I>
I haven't tried to spec it, because as far as I can tell, UAs could 
completely ignore it with no ill effects. If I'm wrong about this, then we 
should spec something.


&gt;<i> 3) Is what is returned a instance of Window or WindowProxy? By that I

</I>&gt;<i> changing the URL (and reloading), is A supposed to have access to the

</I>
You can never get hold of a raw Window object, only WindowProxy objects. 
In your scenario, provided it's all same-origin, A will have an object 
that reflects that the browsing context has a new document loaded in it. 
(It's only one browsing context though.)


&gt;<i> 4) About step 4 of The rules for choosing a browsing context given a
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context name [1]:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the given browsing context name is not |_blank| and there exists a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsing context whose name is the same as the given browsing context 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name, and the current browsing context is allowed to navigate that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsing context, and the user agent determines that the two browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contexts are related enough that it is ok if they reach each other,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does &quot;related enough&quot; mean?
</I>
That's up to the UA.


&gt;<i> How is it implemented in different browsers?
</I>
It varies. Gecko, IIRC, thinks everything is related enough. Chrome 
probably limits it to same-process windows.


&gt;<i> &gt; then that browsing context must be the chosen one. If there are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple matching browsing contexts, the user agent should select one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in some arbitrary consistent manner, such as the most recently opened, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most recently focused, or more closely related.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the &quot;consistent manner&quot; in each implementation?
</I>
I do not know. I hope that this doesn't matter for interop; if I'm wrong, 
let me know and we shall spec it.
