</I>
There's two ways to do scaled sprites with drawImage(): have a border of 
transparent black around each sprite, or copy the data out of the sprite 
sheet and into a temporary canvas at its original size, then scaling from 
that.


&gt;<i> Unfortunately, at present Internet Explorer and Firefox both read pixels

</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1643240/canvas_artifacts.html">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1643240/canvas_artifacts.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Worse still, in implementations with imageSmoothingEnabled available, 
</I>&gt;<i> turning off image smoothing is not sufficient to eliminate the 
</I>&gt;<i> artifacts.
</I>
Disabling image smoothing will increase artefacts, that's kind of the 
point. :-) Having said that, I don't really see what that test case is 
demonstrating. Can you elaborate?


&gt;<i> Google Chrome appears to implement this the way you would probably want 
</I>&gt;<i> it to work - by clamping to the edges of the source rectangle, instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of the source image. I can't think of a good reason to prefer the 
</I>&gt;<i> current behavior over what Chrome does, and I haven't been able to find 
</I>&gt;<i> a reliable way to compensate for the current behavior.
</I>
The reason to prefer the current behaviour is if you want to just update a 
small part of an image. For example, if you draw a bit photo, then draw 
text over it, then want to remove the text by just drawing the photo over 
where the text was but not redrawing the whole thing. If we clamped to 
source rectangle, we'd get artefacts in this case that couldn't be worked 
around (unlike the problems with scaling sprites, which can be worked 
around, albeit in a suboptimal fashion).

</I>
I don't think this reading is consistent with the usage of the term 
&quot;original image data&quot; in the spec. It's pretty consistently used to mean 
the whole image.

I've clarified the spec to make this even less ambiguous.


&gt;<i> Also, it makes more sense to do it that way.
</I>
I think arguments could be made for both ways, but the problem is there's 
only a way to work around one of the ways.

Right.

</I>
I'd be happy to add a flag if it's something browser implementors want to 
support.


&gt;<i> Additionally, I think there's a related bug filed from a while ago about 
</I>&gt;<i> defining how to sample pixels that are outside of the source bounds -- 
</I>&gt;<i> do you clamp to edge, do you sample transparent black, etc.
</I>
Fixing that bug is how the current text came to be, IIRC.

</I>
Right. The second is easy enough to work around by having some empty 
pixels (not ideal, but then neither is scaling sprites, really...). The 
first has no work around that I'm aware of, so if we don't have a flag, it 
should be the one we support.
