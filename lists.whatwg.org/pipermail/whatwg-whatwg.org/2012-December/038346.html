There are solutions to this problem, e.g. you can authenticate to a site 
using your Facebook identity using one or two clicks.


&gt;<i> Second, user accounts are based on e-mails as a rule, which is not

</I>&gt;<i> registrations. Many web-services struggle against users' reputation

</I>
Users can have multiple devices and could tell their browser to provide a 
unique identifier with each page access, so a device ID API wouldn't stop 
or change this.


&gt;<i> Third, I think it's up to a certain web-service design and requirements, 
</I>&gt;<i> if it needs to identify user accounts or user devices. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> usage of the same profile on multiple devices can be a violation of a 
</I>&gt;<i> web-service license agreement, or a web-service may bind several devices 
</I>&gt;<i> to the same profile.
</I>
Binding multiple devices to a profile is easy and done today, it doesn't 
require an identifier.

An identifier wouldn't help stop a user from using multiple devices with 
one site (not that such a restriction would even make sense in the first 
place), because there's no guarantee that the user agent isn't providing 
you with fake device identifiers.


&gt;<i> Multiple browser profiles on the same device do not matter, because the 
</I>&gt;<i> same device ID will be returned.
</I>
What if the different profiles are for different people? Or different 
identities of the same person? (e.g. a woman's professional identity and 
a pseudonymous identity in an assault support group; or a man's identity 
that he uses for this extended family, and his identity that he uses when 
exploring his transexuality?)


&gt;<i> The main point, if device ID could be available it would provide more 
</I>&gt;<i> great possibilities for users and web-services.
</I>
I don't understand what it would provide that would be better than the 
existing ability to use one's identity from an identity provider.
