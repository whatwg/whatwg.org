<PRE>The only thing I've seen in a spec was CSS3 System Appearance, but it had
poor support and was ultimately removed.

2 years ago, I contacted people from Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Opera
about this, but I haven't seen any real progress. A few weeks ago, support
for &lt;input type=&quot;week/month&quot;&gt; landed in Chrome Canary and this fiddle was
provided to show how to prevent the calendar from showing up:
<A HREF="http://jsfiddle.net/PPpUu/">http://jsfiddle.net/PPpUu/</A> This is clunky and doesn't even fully solve the
problem.

Here's one of the emails I sent after getting a response about device
vendors wanting to provide consistent UI/UX throughout the device (tying
their native calendar into controls like &lt;input type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;):

The problem is that no matter how consistent the UI/UX is, I want to
&gt;<i> opt-out because it will never be good enough. I want to customize the UI to
</I>&gt;<i> look like my app, layer on additional functionality, etc. All of this is
</I>&gt;<i> possible today without the new input types. However, once the new input
</I>&gt;<i> types are used, this becomes more difficult. For example, enhancing a text
</I>&gt;<i> field into a datepicker is really common, but you can't do this with a date
</I>&gt;<i> field because of the new UI. I really don't think that JS implementations
</I>&gt;<i> of these input types are ever going to die, no matter how good the native
</I>&gt;<i> implementations work. There's just too much functionality that users will
</I>&gt;<i> want that won't be possible because the APIs would be too large to spec.
</I>&gt;<i> Falling all the way back to text fields works, but then we lose all the
</I>&gt;<i> other benefits, such as the new attributes/methods, built-in validation,
</I>&gt;<i> type-specific virtual keyboards, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> So the end goal is still to have consistent UI/UX cross-browser, but not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily cross-site.
</I>

We get a lot of requests for jQuery UI widgets to work on the new input
types. However, as things are right now, all we can do is say no.

&gt;<i> It is currently difficult to control the visibility of the UI (e.g. little
</I>&gt;<i> arrows, spinners, etc) on new input types like datetime, number, range,
</I>&gt;<i> color, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that many developers want to use the semantic attributes, but need
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to hide the little arrows for various reasons, and so they are
</I>&gt;<i> sticking with type=text (e.g. <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/q/11418289/925897">http://stackoverflow.com/q/11418289/925897</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reasons developers might want to control the visibility of the UI:
</I>&gt;<i> - developer has built their own datepicker/numberfinder/colorpicker/etc
</I>&gt;<i> - developer wants to display just the values (as if it were type=text) upon
</I>&gt;<i> printing, or when readonly, or when not active
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As browsers add support, there will likely be ways to control this using
</I>&gt;<i> vendor-specific CSS, but not only will this vary from browser to browser,
</I>&gt;<i> it will vary among the different input types. For example, in Chrome it is
</I>&gt;<i> currently possible to hide the slider arrows on the number input:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> input[type=&quot;number&quot;]::-webkit-inner-spin-button{
</I>&gt;<i>     -webkit-appearance: none;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This kind of code is clearly going to be very difficult to maintain and
</I>&gt;<i> keep up to date. I don't think a CSS solution is going to work. Has there
</I>&gt;<i> been discussion here on an input attribute that controls the UI? Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;date&quot; ui=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
