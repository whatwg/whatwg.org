What you say makes sense as a generalization of &lt;main&gt; into &lt;article&gt;
that arises as soon as one thinks of how to write processing rules for
the case where a page has more than one &lt;main&gt; even if it isn&#8217;t
supposed to have more than one &lt;main&gt;. However, there are at least
four problems with the &#8220;first &lt;article&gt;&#8221; rule:

 1) The generalization no longer looks the way authors think. The
cowpath being paved is hard to recognize. That is, the idea that you
replace &lt;div id=content&gt; or &lt;div id=main&gt; with &lt;main&gt; is more
intuitive than that you replace &lt;div id=content&gt; with &lt;article&gt; but
you also replace each &lt;div class=comment&gt; with &lt;article&gt; and since the
comments come after the main article, the first &lt;article&gt; ends up
having the semantics of main content.

 2) When role=&quot;main&quot; exists, it&#8217;s hard to convince people that
implicit works as well as explicit. Even if browsers actually exposed
the right accessibility API role for first &lt;article&gt;, authors would
still probably feel it&#8217;s better to say role=&quot;main&quot; just in case. I
would love to see ARIA obsoleted in the sense that people who don&#8217;t
retrofit accessibility to legacy code and who aren&#8217;t recreating GUI
widgets is JS wouldn&#8217;t need to deal with ARIA (where including
role=main just in case because one doesn&#8217;t trust rules like &#8220;first
&lt;article&gt;&#8221; counts as &#8220;needing&#8221; to deal with ARIA).

 3) Even though in principle, the element names are just runes whose
meaning is given by the spec&#8212;not by the English meaning of the element
name, people still try to guess usage from the element name. It&#8217;s
pretty easy to believe from element names alone than &lt;main&gt; is &lt;div
id=content&gt; or &lt;div id=main&gt; made as a part of the language itself.
It&#8217;s harder to grok the defined semantics of &lt;article&gt; from its
element name.

 4) It&#8217;s more obvious to write main { ... } in CSS than
article:first-of-type { ... }

I think it was unfortunate that &lt;main&gt; didn&#8217;t make it to the same
round of added elements as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;aside&gt;. But
it&#8217;s not too late to add it&#8212;browsers update faster than they used to.

Steve&#8217;s research suggests that role=main is the most popular ARIA
landmark. Hixie&#8217;s own research data from 2005 shows that there&#8217;s a
stronger cowpath to be paved than in the case of some other
landmarkish elements when you consider class=content and stronger than
any of the other landmarkish elements when you sum class=content and
class=main together:
