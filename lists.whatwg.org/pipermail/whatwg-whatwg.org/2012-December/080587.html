Yes, it should follow.  The only reason it wouldn't do that is it were
explained in terms of a one-shot adjustment of top/left.  The fact
that it's done in terms of a (not yet specced) anchoring functionality
means that as long as the anchor is specified, the two elements should
have the correct relationship.

&gt;<i> Relatedly, it's not clear what happens if anchor is display: none or is not
</I>&gt;<i> in the document when show() is called, but later has a rendered box and is
</I>&gt;<i> in the document. And the reverse: if it is in the document when show() is
</I>&gt;<i> called and later is removed.
</I>
The spec defines this - the magical alignment only happens while A and
B have rendered boxes.  When the conditions don't apply, it's not
magically aligned.  (The spec's recommendation for CSS is somewhat
badly designed for this - assume that it merely forces A to
&quot;position:absolute&quot;, and while B doesn't have a box, A isn't anchored
and is interpreted as a normal abspos box.)
