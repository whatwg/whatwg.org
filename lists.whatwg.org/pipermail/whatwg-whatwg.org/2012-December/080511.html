<PRE>
It might be good to use a custom MIME type instead of multipart/mixed. multipart/mixed can represent arbitrary heterogenous sequences of types, which is not the desired semantic here - you want a sequence of all text/javascript types. It also has a syntactic affordance for conveying a MIME type per chunk, which is unnecessary in this case. Since browsers will likely need custom logic for this case anyway, I think it might be better to have a multipart/javascript type. Note: if this feature is needed for other script types, let's say vbscript, you could mint distinct types like multipart/vbscript, or use a MIME parameter: &quot;multipart/script; type=text/javascript&quot;

&gt;<i> == Use case ==
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Load and execute script as quickly as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> == Discussion ==
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, there are a number of ways to load a script from the
</I>&gt;<i> network and execute it, but none of them will actually load and
</I>&gt;<i> execute the script as fast as physically possible.  Consider the
</I>&gt;<i> following markup:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, the user agent will wait until it receives the last byte
</I>&gt;<i> of script.js from the network before executing the first byte of
</I>&gt;<i> script.js.  In principle, the user agent could finish executing
</I>&gt;<i> script.js sooner if it could overlap some of the execution time with
</I>&gt;<i> some of the network latency, for example by executing a chunk of the
</I>&gt;<i> script while waiting for the bytes for the next chunk to arrive from
</I>&gt;<i> the network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, without additional information, the user agent doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> know where &quot;safe&quot; chunk boundaries are located.  Picking an arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> byte boundary is likely to cause a syntax error, and even picking an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary JavaScript statement boundary will change the semantics of
</I>&gt;<i> the script.  The user agent needs some sort of signal from the author
</I>&gt;<i> to know where the safe chunk boundaries are located.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> == Workarounds ==
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The simplest work around is to break your script into several pieces:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script-part1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script-part2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script-part3.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, script-part1.js will execute before the user agent has received
</I>&gt;<i> the last byte of script-part3.js.  Unfortunately, this approach does
</I>&gt;<i> not make efficient use of the network.  Specifically, if the three
</I>&gt;<i> parts are retrieved from the network in parallel, then the user agent
</I>&gt;<i> might receive a byte from script-part3.js before receiving all the
</I>&gt;<i> bytes of script-part1.js, wasting network bandwidth (because the bytes
</I>&gt;<i> from script-part3.js are not useful until all of script-part1.js is
</I>&gt;<i> received an executed).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A more sophisticated workaround is to use an &lt;iframe&gt; element rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a &lt;script&gt; element to load the script:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;iframe src=&quot;path/to/script-in-markup.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this approach, script-in-markup.html is the following HTML:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [... text of script-part1.js ...]
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [... text of script-part2.js ...]
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [... text of script-part3.js ...]
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the bytes of the script are retrieved from the network in the
</I>&gt;<i> proper order (making efficient use of bandwidth) and the user agent
</I>&gt;<i> can overlap execution of the script with network latency (because the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt; tags delineate the safe chunks).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This approach is used in production web applications, including Gmail,
</I>&gt;<i> to load and execute script as quickly as possible.  If you inspect a
</I>&gt;<i> running copy of Gmail, you can find this frame---it's the one with ID
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;js_frame&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this approach as a number of disadvantages:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Creating an extra &lt;iframe&gt; for loading JavaScript is not resource
</I>&gt;<i> efficient.  The user agent needs to create a number of extra data
</I>&gt;<i> structures and an extra JavaScript environment, which wastes time as
</I>&gt;<i> well as memory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Authors need to write their scripts with the understanding that
</I>&gt;<i> the primary callers of their code will do so from another frame.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, the instanceof operator might not work as expected if they
</I>&gt;<i> ask whether an object from the caller (i.e., from the parent frame) is
</I>&gt;<i> an instance of a constructor from the callee's environment (i.e., from
</I>&gt;<i> the child frame).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) This approach requires the author who loads the script to use
</I>&gt;<i> different syntax than normally used for loading script.  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> this prevents this technique from being applied to the JavaScript
</I>&gt;<i> libraries that Google hosts (as described by
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/</A>&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> == Proposal ==
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &lt;script&gt; element should support multipart/mixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> == Details ===
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main ingredient that we're missing is a way for the author to
</I>&gt;<i> signal to the user agent which chunks of scripts are safe to execute
</I>&gt;<i> in parallel with loading subsequent chunks from the network.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, the web platform already has a mechanism for breaking a
</I>&gt;<i> single HTTP response body into chunks that are processed sequentially:
</I>&gt;<i> multipart/mixed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, if an HTTP server provides a multipart/mixed response to
</I>&gt;<i> a request for an image, the &lt;img&gt; element will display each part of
</I>&gt;<i> the response in sequence, animating the image.  Similarly, if an HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> server provides a multipart/mixed response to a request for an HTML
</I>&gt;<i> document, the user agent will display each part of the response
</I>&gt;<i> sequentially.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One way to address this use case is to add multipart/mixed support to
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;script&gt; element.  Upon receiving a multipart/mixed response to a
</I>&gt;<i> request for a script, the &lt;script&gt; element must execute each part of
</I>&gt;<i> the response as they become available.  This behavior appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> consistent with the definition of multipart/mixed
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-5.1.3">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-5.1.3</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To load and execute a script as quickly as possible, the author would
</I>&gt;<i> use the following markup:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script async src=&quot;path/to/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The HTTP server would then break script.js into chunks that are safe
</I>&gt;<i> to execute sequentially and provide each chunk as a separate MIME part
</I>&gt;<i> in a multipart/mixed response.
