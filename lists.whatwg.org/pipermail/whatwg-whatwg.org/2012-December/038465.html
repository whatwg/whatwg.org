<PRE>
I've added a feature to HTML to enable users (and authors) to sort tables.

The basic design of the feature is that if a column's &lt;th&gt; has a sorted=&quot;&quot; 
attribute, the UA will sort the table every time the mutation observers 
would fire (before they fire). A table can have a sortable=&quot;&quot; attribute, 
which lets the user tell the user agent to add sorted=&quot;&quot; attributes to 
columns to sort them.

Done.

Well I guess nothing would stop us supporting sorted=&quot;&quot; on &lt;th&gt;s at the 
front of a row, but boy, that would be a lot more complicated to do. You'd 
have to be moving cells around all over the place.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not every table has content that makes sense to be sorted in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; different order. So sortable tables should be marked as such. Note 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that &#145;col&#146; and &#145;colgroup&#146; elements are hardly supported.
</I>
&lt;table sortable&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not every column has content that makes sense to be sorted in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; different order. So non-sortable columns inside sortable tables 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; should be marked as such.
</I>
Any column with a &lt;th&gt; is sortable, for now. We can add a &quot;nosort&quot; column 
or something later if this becomes a problem.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There are different ways to sort, eg. numeric, temporal or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; alphabetic and ascending or descending. Therefore columns should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bear information how they should be sorted, ie. what kind of content 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their cells have.
</I>
Ascending/descending is supported (sorted=&quot;reversed&quot;).

Any temporal syntax supported by &lt;time&gt; can be used by putting &lt;time&gt; as 
the only child of the cells to sort.

I intend to spec some sort of algorithm for doing numeric/string 
comparison, but haven't yet come up with a good solution. If you have any 
suggestions, this is the bug tracking this issue:

   <A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20524">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20524</A>


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Several columns may be used for sorting by some kind of priority.
</I>
You can set sorted=&quot;&quot; on multiple columns' headers, and give a sort key 
cardinality in each, as in sorted=&quot;1&quot;, sorted=&quot;2&quot;, etc.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The original order must be restorable.
</I>
This I have not supported. I don't see how to support it sanely.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Cell content may not consist of the string that should be used 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; verbatim for sorting purposes, eg. leading articles or similar 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; numbers with different units (&#145;g&#146;, &#145;kg&#146;, &#145;t&#146; &#133;). Cells should have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an optional attribute indicating their sort key. The &#145;time&#146; element 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; already provides the necessary metadata features for temporal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sorting &#150; maybe there should be more of such elements instead.
</I>
I've used &lt;data&gt; for this, alongside &lt;time&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There may be columns that shall remain stable, eg. rank numbers.
</I>
I haven't supported this. I've no idea how to do this sanely, especially 
given cells with column and row spans.


&gt;<i> 1. Would sorting actually reorder the DOM nodes or just change their 
</I>&gt;<i> visual order? It's not clear to me which one is better. I think the 
</I>&gt;<i> former is what you'd want most of the time.
</I>
I've gone with reordering the DOM nodes. Things like :nth-child styling 
become nigh on impossible without doing it at the DOM level, not to 
mention the confusion that would reign from having such a dramatic 
disconnect between rendering and DOM (e.g. with abs pos, etc).


&gt;<i> 2. What values should the sort property allow. One idea is that it takes 
</I>&gt;<i> a JS function similar to what JavaScript's sort function takes. If you 
</I>&gt;<i> leave it out then it just does alphanumeric sort.
</I>
I was going to have a comparator function, but I couldn't see a sane way 
to make it work in the face of hostile functions that mutate the DOM, so 
I dropped it. You can do custom sort orders by giving a key in the &lt;data&gt; 
element's value=&quot;&quot; attribute, though.


&gt;<i> 3. What elements does it go on? I don't see what it would do on a td. I 
</I>&gt;<i> could see putting it on a th though. Also, it's not clear to me what 
</I>&gt;<i> would get sorted. For example, in some tables, you would group trs 
</I>&gt;<i> inside tbodys and want to sort those.
</I>
sorted=&quot;&quot; goes on a column-heading &lt;th&gt;, ideally in a &lt;thead&gt; but you can 
also put it on the first row of your &lt;tbody&gt; if you don't have a &lt;thead&gt;. 
Rows are sorted on a per-group basis. Rows that span each other are 
treated as one row for sorting.

</I>&gt;<i> Another obvious question: how does (or should) sorting interact with

</I>
The sort algorithm groups rows that span each other together and treats 
them as one (using the data in their top row for sorting).

Interesting, thanks.


&gt;<i> Also, a sortable table's header needed some indication of the sortability,

</I>&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>
I haven't defined the styling in detail, pending both user agent 
implementation experience and the addition of :sorted to CSS.

Thank you very much for your input, it was invaluable.


&gt;<i> Sorttable.js, my script, has the guiding principle of not needing 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration in most cases. Therefore, it attempts to guess the type of 
</I>&gt;<i> a table column: if a column looks like it contains numbers, sorttable 
</I>&gt;<i> will use numeric sort (1 before 2 before 100) rather than alphanumeric 
</I>&gt;<i> sort (1 before 100 before 2); if a column looks like it contains date 
</I>&gt;<i> information, then sorttable will sort by date (for formats DD/MM/YYYY 
</I>&gt;<i> and MM/DD/YYYY). The algorithm used for this guessing is pretty naive 
</I>&gt;<i> (check the first cell in a column; if it's blank, check the next one; 
</I>&gt;<i> etc). I think that this, by itself, has accounted for sorttable's 
</I>&gt;<i> popularity, because in most cases, it Just Works; you add a &lt;script&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element pointing to the script, and class=&quot;sortable&quot; to the &lt;table&gt;, and 
</I>&gt;<i> do *nothing else*, and your table is sortable without any configuration.
</I>
I intend to do something along those lines for HTML's sorting algorithm 
also, though that is still up in the air (see above).


&gt;<i> Everything else below here is configuration-based: something you'd have 
</I>&gt;<i> to do explicitly as an author. The above point is the critical one; 
</I>&gt;<i> guessing column types to make table sorting be zero-config. Some 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative scripts require you to explicitly tag date or numeric 
</I>&gt;<i> columns, and I think that authors see that as annoying. Anecdata, of 
</I>&gt;<i> course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorttable also allows authors to specify &quot;alternate content&quot; for a cell. 
</I>&gt;<i> That is (ignore the invalid HTML attribute here; I didn't know any 
</I>&gt;<i> better, and we didn't have data-* attributes when I wrote this stuff)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;td sorttable_customkey=&quot;11&quot;&gt;eleven&lt;/td&gt;
</I>
&lt;td&gt;&lt;data value=&quot;11&quot;&gt;eleven&lt;/data&gt;&lt;/td&gt;


&gt;<i> This is basically useful for when you have table data which has a 
</I>&gt;<i> definite order but it can't be autoguessed, or (more usefully still) 
</I>&gt;<i> when it could be autoguessed but that would be hard. The canonical 
</I>&gt;<i> example of this is dates: it would be exceedingly annoying, given 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;td&gt;Wed 7th November, 10.00am GMT&lt;/td&gt; to have to parse that cell 
</I>&gt;<i> content in JavaScript to turn it back into a Date() so it can be placed 
</I>&gt;<i> in sort order with other dates. The sorttable.js solution is to specify 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;custom key&quot;, which sorttable pretends was the cell content for the 
</I>&gt;<i> purposes of sorting, so &lt;td sorttable_customkey=&quot;20121107-100000&quot;&gt;Wed 
</I>&gt;<i> 7th November, 10.00am GMT&lt;/td&gt; and then the script can sort it.
</I>
&lt;td&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2012-11-07T10:00Z&quot;&gt;Wed 7th November, 10.00am GMT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/td&gt;


&gt;<i> This feature is basically the get-out clause, an author hook for saying 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I know what I want, but your fancy sorting thing can't handle it; how 
</I>&gt;<i> do I override that?&quot; They can specify custom keys for all their TDs and 
</I>&gt;<i> then sorting will work fine. (Obviously, dates are less of a problem in 
</I>&gt;<i> theory today with &lt;date&gt; elements, but... how does the script know to 
</I>&gt;<i> use the datetime attribute of the &lt;date&gt; in &lt;td&gt;&lt;date&gt;...&lt;/date&gt;&lt;/td&gt;?)
</I>
In the case of the spec, if the &lt;td&gt; element's only child is a &lt;time&gt; or a 
&lt;data&gt;, it knows to use the datetime=&quot;&quot; or value=&quot;&quot; attributes respectively.


&gt;<i> In roughly descending order of popularity, here is what I've been asked 
</I>&gt;<i> questions about, over the last decade or so:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Sorting tables inserted after page load. This is obviously not a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem (sorting a table created with JS rather than in the base HTML), 
</I>&gt;<i> and sorttable should handle it without explicit action from the author 
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;mark&quot; a table as sortable, but it doesn't because of laziness from 
</I>&gt;<i> me. I include it for completeness because sorttable not handling it 
</I>&gt;<i> generates probably a third of all the sorttable complaint email I 
</I>&gt;<i> receive; a properly specced sortable tables implementation in browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> would obviously handle this and wouldn't need to even have it specified.
</I>
Supported.


&gt;<i> 2. Sorting a table on page load. That is: a table in HTML containing 
</I>&gt;<i> unsorted data should be sorted by the browser when the page loads, 
</I>&gt;<i> without user action. Sorttable doesn't do this because I think it's 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong (if you want sorted data when the page loads, serve it as sorted 
</I>&gt;<i> in the HTML), but lots of people ask for it.
</I>
Supported, though I'm not sure how good an idea this will end up being.


&gt;<i> 3. Multiple header rows. Many authors have two or more &lt;tr&gt;s in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;thead&gt;, one of which contains rowspanned &lt;th&gt;s, to group columns 
</I>&gt;<i> together. If this happens, which &lt;th&gt;s are clickable to sort the table? 
</I>&gt;<i> Which are not? This is hard to autodiagnose (and indeed sorttable punts 
</I>&gt;<i> on it and picks the first one, which is almost certainly wrong; even 
</I>&gt;<i> naively picking the last &lt;tr&gt; inside &lt;thead&gt; would be better, but still 
</I>&gt;<i> imperfect).
</I>
The spec picks the highest non-spanning &lt;th&gt; in a column, if there's a 
&lt;thead&gt;. (If there's not, it uses the top row's &lt;th&gt;, if it doesn't span 
columns.)


&gt;<i> 4. Handling colspans and rowspans in the table. Sorttable.js basically 
</I>&gt;<i> punts on this, because what's expected to happen when you sort a column 
</I>&gt;<i> which contains only half a cell (because the other half's in another 
</I>&gt;<i> column, with rowspan=2) is wildly author-specific. But a properly 
</I>&gt;<i> specced solution doesn't get to punt and say &quot;unsupported&quot;. This will 
</I>&gt;<i> need some thought.
</I>
For column spanning, the spec's model basically just acts as if the cell 
isn't spanning, but is in each column it spans.

So e.g. &lt;td colspan=2&gt;X&lt;/td&gt; is treated as &lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;, for the 
purposes of sorting.


&gt;<i> 5. Numeric sort handling exponented numbers such as 1.5e6 (which do not 
</I>&gt;<i> match a naive &quot;is this a number&quot; regexp such as /^[0-9]+$/ )
</I>
I'd like to support this as part of the algorithm mentioned bofer:

   <A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20524">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=20524</A>


&gt;<i> 6. Specifying how to display that a column is sorted. This would likely 
</I>&gt;<i> be done in this specification by leaving it to CSS and 
</I>&gt;<i> th::sorted-forward { after: content(&quot;v&quot;); } or some such thing (I have 
</I>&gt;<i> no policy suggestions here), but authors want to be able to specify 
</I>&gt;<i> this, along with different styles for a sorted column. This is mildly 
</I>&gt;<i> more awkward because there's no real concept of a column in the DOM of 
</I>&gt;<i> an HTML table, but perhaps all the TDs could grow a pseudo 
</I>&gt;<i> ::sorted-forward or something (handwaving here like mad, obviously).
</I>
I haven't specced this yet but once CSS has the :sorted pseudo (bug 20522) 
I expect we'll be able to do something like:

   th:sorted(ascending)::after { content: &quot;v&quot;; }


&gt;<i> 7. Case sensitivity in alphannumeric sorting. Some people like it, some 
</I>&gt;<i> people don't; it's good to have some sort of author-controllable switch. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Obviously solveable with &lt;td 
</I>&gt;<i> sorttable_customkey=&quot;INSENSITIVE&quot;&gt;Insensitive&lt;/td&gt; in the limit case,
</I>
I intend to only support insensitive comparisons initially, but if that's 
a problem we can definitely revisit it somehow. (It can't be worked around 
easily, unlike the other way around.)


&gt;<i> and this, like many other things on this list, suggests that some sort 
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;here is the JavaScript function I want you to use to produce sort 
</I>&gt;<i> keys for table cells in this column&quot; function is a useful idea. 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorttable allows this, and people use it a lot.)
</I>
I tried to do this but couldn't figure out a sane way to do it. A 
comparator can totally destroy the table we're sorting, and I don't know 
what to do if that happens.


&gt;<i> 8. Mark a column as not sortable. Note: this does not mean that clicking 
</I>&gt;<i> on that column doesn't sort it; it means that that column does not get 
</I>&gt;<i> sorted *even when the rest of the table does*. This gets requested for a 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of &quot;left-hand header&quot; concept, where the first column contains 
</I>&gt;<i> numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc, one per row, to show which is row 1, row 2, row 
</I>&gt;<i> 3 etc of the table. Obviously this column should not be sorted when the 
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the table is. I'm not sure there's any good markup for this in 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML (&lt;ol&gt;s do it, but there's no &lt;ol&gt; concept for &lt;tr&gt;s).
</I>
I haven't supported this. To some extent, it's presentational, and thus 
can be done using something like:

   tr::before { display: table-cell; content: counter(row); }

...or some such.


&gt;<i> 9. A commonly requested type of things to know how to automatically sort 
</I>&gt;<i> is IP addresses. (I solve this by forwarding people the email explaining 
</I>&gt;<i> how to add a new sort type function to sorttable, because I've never got 
</I>&gt;<i> around to adding it to the script.)
</I>
This is something that should end up supported by the sorting algorithm 
automatically.


&gt;<i> 10. Zebra-striped tables are a problem. Well, they're not a problem if 
</I>&gt;<i> you're striping with CSS (#mytable tr:nth-child(2n) td { background: 
</I>&gt;<i> #eee; }) but an awful lot of people bake the stripes into their HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;tr class=&quot;even&quot;&gt;), and this gets screwed up if you sort the table. The 
</I>&gt;<i> solution here obviously might be to poke authors to do presentational 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff with CSS instead and then their problems go away, but *lots* of 
</I>&gt;<i> people complain about this.
</I>
:<i>nth-child() is more widely supported than this feature, so I think it 
</I>makes sense to rely on the former if you're relying on the latter.


&gt;<i> 11. Authors like the idea of having script callbacks before and after a 
</I>&gt;<i> user action to sort, so they can do things to the table, show progress 
</I>&gt;<i> or an hourglass, etc. This would presumably be neatly handled by firing 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;sort&quot; event on the table or similar.
</I>
I've made 'sort' get fired at the table before the sort starts. Nothing is 
fired after currently.


&gt;<i> 12. Stable sort: I recommend that the sort that's implemented be 
</I>&gt;<i> specified as being a stable sort, because people who care really want it 
</I>&gt;<i> and write me annoyed emails that it's not there, and no-one explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i> wants unstable sort. :)
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> 13. What happens if a table has multiple &lt;tbody&gt; elements? Do they sort 
</I>&gt;<i> as independent units, or mingle together? Sorttable just sorts the first 
</I>&gt;<i> one and ignores the rest, because multiple tbodies are uncommon, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that's not really acceptable ;-)
</I>
Independent.


&gt;<i> 14. Fixed-position rows. Many authors have a &quot;totals&quot; row at the bottom 
</I>&gt;<i> of their table which should remain at the bottom of the table even after 
</I>&gt;<i> sorting, which is easily handled (that's what &lt;tfoot&gt; is for), but some 
</I>&gt;<i> authors also have rows midway through the table which are &quot;headers&quot;: 
</I>&gt;<i> this especially shows up in long tables, where the column headers from 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;thead&gt; are repeated midway down the table and should remain in position 
</I>&gt;<i> even when the table is sorted. In general this means that they should 
</I>&gt;<i> remain the same number of rows away from &lt;thead&gt;. This case is odd, and 
</I>&gt;<i> sorttable.js doesn't handle it, but lots of people ask for it.
</I>
&lt;tfoot&gt; is supported as suggested. Haven't done it for the mid-rows. Not 
sure how to make that work while sorting around them. I mean, you'd have 
to count the number of rows before each one so that you put back the right 
number of rows or something...

</I>&gt;<i> This could also apply to HTML lists: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;.

I haven't added this. I'm curious as to the use cases and how much 
implementation interest there is (I guess this would primarily be for 
validators?).

I'm happy to strip out the current text in the spec and add in something 
more like this model if there's implementation and author interest, but I 
don't really understand what you are proposing. Can you elaborate?

That's an interesting idea, but I don't think it's the right approach. 
Some elements are not elements you want to clone (e.g. &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, 
&lt;input&gt;). And it's not clear how you remerge them.

That's an interesting idea. I'm dubious about overloading the logic like 
this, though, lest it make authors set invalid scope values just to get 
sorting enabled/disabled.

I'd rather just add an attribute that says &quot;this can't be a sort column&quot;, 
if that's really a need.

When is it a need, though? I'd love to study a table that has a column 
that it doesn't make sense to sort by.

Not sure what you mean, but for what it's worth, the spec as written will 
skip over and rows at the top of &lt;tbody&gt;s that consist of only &lt;th&gt;s.


&gt;<i> Use case: A data table that only have row headers.
</I>&gt;<i> Row that is in the scope of an rowspans data cell (td) would be fixed.
</I>
If a data table only has row headers, I'm not sure how to sort it.

Not sure what this means.
