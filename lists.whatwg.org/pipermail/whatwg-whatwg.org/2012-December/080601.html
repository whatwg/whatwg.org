<PRE>This was meant to follow-up to Henri's message[1]:

[1] <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-December/038219.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-December/038219.html</A>

but for some reason that didn't make it to my archives so I'm replying
to the latest message on this thread that did.


tl;dr: Having previously opposed the addition of a main element, I've
been convinced by the arguments (and counter-counter-arguments) and
evidence presented[1] that it's worth adding &lt;main&gt; to HTML.


I'm a strong advocate of being conservative of adding new elements to
HTML. Every element we add has a cost (in maintenance, learning etc.)
and perhaps increasingly so. That's the &quot;high bar&quot; that has been
referenced that has to be met - a new element must provide advantages
outweighing the cost to all of us of adding a new element. In
particular I am thinking of the cost to authors/developers of
continuing to grow HTML and its complexity.

&lt;aside&gt;
If anything I think I've grown more conservative regarding new
elements in this regard based on experience teaching authors. I used
to support &lt;hgroup&gt;, and though while I personally find it useful in
content, I no longer find its addition useful enough for authors in
general to overcome the confusion it adds. Similarly with &lt;section&gt;
(which appears to be turning into an alias for &lt;div&gt;). IMO the outline
algorithm is dead and we could simplify HTML by dropping these two.
&lt;/aside&gt;

There has been a lot of reference to previous threads (on this list,
other lists, etc.) and at some point it becomes useless to say &quot;go
search the mail archives&quot; because no one has time follow all the
meandering threads.

I've written up a wiki page documenting what I believe to be
sufficient arguments to add the &lt;main&gt; element, along with arguments
against that I've heard and rebuttals, as well as counter-proposals
made along with flaws in counter-proposals:

<A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Main_element">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Main_element</A>

Contributions/corrections/citations welcome, both for *and* against &lt;main&gt;.

&gt;<i>From discussions I've seen there appears to be a growing implementer
</I>consensus that adding a &lt;main&gt; element helps more than it hurts and
thus I expect to see it happen.

However, I still think adding main is fully supported on principle
(rather than just on browser-implementation-Hixie-veto-override) and
thus I'm interested in capturing that on the wiki page so that
hopefully we can learn from this analysis about adding a new element
and use those lessons when considering new elements in the future.

Thanks,

Tantek
