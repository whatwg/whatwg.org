</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; The only situation that might be reasonable would be a transform on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; the Canvas that an author want to cover in the Path. But for the rare
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; case where this matters, you can create a new Path object, add your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; path with the transform and call isPointInPath.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yeah, you could do that too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Furthermore, a transform() function that applies to a Path object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; seems to be useable as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can create a new Path, then add another Path to it while applying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a transform, using the addPath() method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, it is possible. But there are two reasons why I think that it still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes sense to use a transform function. First it seems natural to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a transform on Path object, like the CanvasRenderingContext2D already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has. Both share a lot of functions, why disallow it for transforms?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main reason I didn't add it to Path is because it led to a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion in terms of what the transform applied to. Does it apply when
</I>&gt;<i> you add points _to_ the path? Does it apply when you draw the path on
</I>&gt;<i> another path or the canvas? Also, one of the more confusing aspects of the
</I>&gt;<i> canvas API is that you can change the coordinate space while adding lines
</I>&gt;<i> to the path, and we had a whole era wherein implemenations and the spec
</I>&gt;<i> were confused as to what exactly happened when (did the points get
</I>&gt;<i> transformed? Did the transform apply only when you stroke? etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the new API I side-stepped the whole problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't understand. How did you sidestep the problem?
It is still confusing. for instance, reading the current spec, transforms
happen before stroking in addPathByStrokingPath, but after stroking in
addPathByStrokingText. Why is that?

Wouldn't it be easier to have API's that
- create a path with svg path data
- create a path with text (and a style)
- stroke a path with a style
- add a path with a optional transform

We also should discuss what 'adding' a path means. Currently, the shapes
are simply aggregated which will only work for simple cases.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second, the solution that you mention requires a copy operation. A lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of libraries would create a new path, add the other path and apply the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transform afterwards. Seems unnecessary for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really follow. Can you elaborate?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The interface of CanvasRenderingContext2D currently has a function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; called isPointInPath() with a Path object as input [1]. I wonder why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; this needs to be on the context interface. Wouldn't it make more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; sense on the interface of Path object itself? If an implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; really needs a context to get a point on a path it, it can create it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; on it's own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't think it would make _more_ sense, but I agree that it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; make equal amounts of sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In practice you're pretty much always going to have a context around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; when you want to check this, because the reason you'd use it is to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; where I mouse click landed on a canvas. And you're going to want the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Path object transformed as per the transform on the canvas, generally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; speaking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not necessarily. The path object makes sense outside of canvas as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You don't need a context to create it so we are thinking of integrating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it with SVG. It would increase interop and simplfy the API's if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could ask SVG elements for their path, or create them with one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but with SVG you don't need to know if a point is in a path, because
</I>&gt;<i> the events get dispatched to the right path by the UA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That assumes that you always have an event handler attached to the path.
This might not always be the case. For instance in a game, you might want
to know what region of the character you hit.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe if there was a 'currentpath' property on the 2d context, you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move 'isPointInPath' to the path object. This would let you get rid of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the extra 'isPointInPath' that takes a path too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   myContext.currentpath.isPointInPath(...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really see what problem this solves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It simplifies the API and gives you access to the current path.


&gt;<i> &gt; Most of the time you don't want to know if a point falls in the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; path in the canvas. You want to know after you finish drawing and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user clicks on the canvas if he hit a region. By then the path in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; canvas is long gone (unless you want to go through the trouble of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redrawing everything).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, and for that we have the hit region API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that is true.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with Ian that there shouldn't be a method that changes the
</I>&gt;<i> current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; points in a path.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, if there was a 'transform' function that took a matrix and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returned a transformed path, it would do what Dirk wants.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition, the path API's could be simplified since you can take out
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 'transform' arguments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you elaborate on the use case for this?
</I>

Simplify the API's so they're easier to understand and implement.


&gt;<i> Why would you transform a path
</I>&gt;<i> without immediately using it somewhere?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't understand. Can you rephrase?

It's not that big of a deal.
In postscript, 'currentPath' was very handy and used quite a bit.

A UA would have to initialize and store the value in each drawing state.
Maybe not super expensive, but if we keep adding things to the state, it
will eventually make a difference.
