</I>
Yes, I don't understand why browsers do this. It drives me crazy, as a 
user.


&gt;<i> As long as that remains the case we are giving authors two options:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A) Use &quot;pile of &lt;div&gt;s&quot; to render context menu and get full control over

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B) Use &lt;menu&gt; to create a more accessible menu, but accept that they 
</I>&gt;<i> will always be listed together with a list of UA items.
</I>
Browsers don't _have_ to show their items with the contextmenu=&quot;&quot; menu. If 
the two choices above are the only choices, then it seems to me that 
browsers should just not include their menu in the contextmenu=&quot;&quot; menu.


&gt;<i> * &quot;more options&quot; isn't always equivalent to &quot;better UX&quot;. I.e. even a 
</I>&gt;<i> website that has the intent and knowledge to design the, for the user, 
</I>&gt;<i> perfect UX would hide many or all of the built-in menu items in many 
</I>&gt;<i> cases.
</I>
Right, this is why I suggested that the UA should drop all non-context- 
specific items when there's a page context menu. So e.g. for Firefox, in 
the default (context menu on &lt;body&gt;) case, keep Inspect Element and View 
Background Image, but drop everything else.


&gt;<i> All of this makes me think that in very many cases authors will choose 
</I>&gt;<i> option A above.
</I>
In that case, when would it make sense for the browser to ever include the 
default menu items? i.e. why not make &quot;nodefault&quot; the default?


&gt;<i> Additionally, the nodefault attribute proposed in [1] can be treated
</I>&gt;<i> by the UA as a hint without risking pages breaking. For example it
</I>&gt;<i> could choose to hide only non-critical menu items. Or hide none of
</I>&gt;<i> them but move them into a sub-menu.
</I>
Why not do this anyway, always, and forego the attribute?


&gt;<i> While mean that authors still wouldn't have 100% control over the UX, 
</I>&gt;<i> they would have dramatically more control than as the proposal stands 
</I>&gt;<i> now, heavily tipping the scale towards option B.
</I>
The proposal as it stands now is that the browsers can show only the 
page's context menu, only the user agent's context menu, or anything in 
between. I don't think it's &quot;heavily tipped&quot; in either direction.
