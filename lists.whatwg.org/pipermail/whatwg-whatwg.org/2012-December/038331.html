It is just not offered on iPad. Android 4.2 introduced it and the response from the users is amazing.
Many people share a tablet in family also in Europe (and I think in US, too).  
&gt;<i> &gt; The main point, if device ID could be available it would provide more great possibilities for users and web-services.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> And it would create big challenges in usability and privacy.
</I>
That would be the biggest challenge I think.
Privacy would be fully exposed to the web service and that for good reason won't work (at least) in the EU.
So this technique would be illegal to use in European countries regarding current privacy laws.
