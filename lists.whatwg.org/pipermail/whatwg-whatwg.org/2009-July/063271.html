That section no longer exists.

</I>
The user agent is allowed to skip past a video file it deems unsuitable, 
but as currently written, the algorithm precludes the user agent skipping 
past a resource based on the presence or absence of a further resource 
that it deems superior.

Localisation in general of HTML isn't supported at the moment; it's 
assumed that this will be done server-side. (I don't see why we'd support 
localisation of video and audio media when we don't support localisation 
of text or images yet).

</I>
When would you fall back? For example, while parsing, would you fall back 
in between the &lt;video&gt; element being parsed and the first &lt;source&gt; element 
being parsed?

The design you describe is what &lt;object&gt; tried to do, and it proved to be 
extremely problematic in practice -- and that was without another built-in 
fallback mechanism to complicate matters.

</I>
In practice, as people keep pointing out to me, it's only Apple that 
supports &lt;video&gt; but doesn't support Theora. If people really want to push 
Apple into supporting Theora, the best way to do it would be to just keep 
using it as if it was the common codec, and _not_ provide another fallback 
for &lt;video&gt;-supporting UAs -- then things would work fine it non-&lt;video&gt;- 
supporting UAs like IE (through fallback flash support inside &lt;video&gt;), 
and would work fine in Theora-supporting UAs, but Safari would be left in 
the cold.

Not supporting Safari would be an effective way of pressuring Apple.

</I>
We presumably don't want to make the use of uncumbered codecs easier.


&gt;<i> Sites might want to do this even if there were an agreed-upon common

</I>
Sanity and simplicity in implementation is the main advantage. With 
&lt;object&gt;, fallback proved to be a huge source of bugs for years.

</I>
I tend to agree that if Theora is considered a contender now, I don't see 
why we wouldn't think H.264 would be a contender when its patents expire. 
But in any case I doubt we have to wait that long, as I discussed in my 
long e-mail on this a few weeks ago.


&gt;<i> This was a minor side point to what I think is the main point:  &lt;video&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> one wants to use it.
</I>
The design of &lt;video&gt; from the ground up is based on the idea that in
browsers that support the element, the API will be used. If we change this 
assumption, then the entire design of the element would have to be 
reconsidered -- in particular, I think we would need to find a way to 
avoid people having to implement the script side twice, in such a 
scenario. We don't get a consistent design if we change the assumptions at 
the slightest provocation. In practice I don't think that the assumption 
is wrong on the long term, though it may be tested on the short term.
