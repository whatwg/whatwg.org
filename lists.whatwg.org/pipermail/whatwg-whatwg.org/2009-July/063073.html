I said most parts (by which I meant the actual image manipulations, which  
are defined pretty well in the SVG spec, not the surrounding issues of when  
to do drawing updates and so on that wouldn't apply to a Canvas  
anyway) :) . OK, I made it sound simpler than it is, but when you get right  
down to it, just the drawing code isn't terribly complicated.

I'm fearing that the dependency on SVG would bring a lot of problems if a  
browser vendor wants to include just Canvas, like WebKit on the Palm Pre.  
Also, the SVG model is pretty complex when you include all the ways to  
cross-reference data. What would happen if a filter would want to load an  
image? Canvas can't work asyc, so either the whole call would fail or we'd  
lock up the browser for ages. Security issues would also increase tenfold  
as Canvas has a pretty simple security model. If we'd allow normal SVG  
filters, we'd probably need to flag the Canvas as &quot;dirty&quot;, since SVG flters  
allow for loading of data from many sources, including what's currently on  
the screen. Or we forbid only dangerous elements, but that would mean that  
Canvas filters would look like SVG filters, but really function differently.

Including a dedicated filter API for Canvas would keep it simple and  
self-contained, allowing for much easier implementation, wouldn't it?

It would also give us a chance to strip out SVG stuff that doesn't make any  
sense for Canvas or is too complicated for too little benefit.
