There wasn't much for h.264 when it was being standardized. There was
committment, yes, but little actual hardware until after H.264 was
standardized and the big names of the time requested the chips: Creative,
Samsung, etc.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a rarely used fallback format to be especially relevant to their own

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I believe he means in the context of the current situation that Theora is
rarely used fallback format. I expect that it would change, given time and a
clear push for Theora. That's why I believe the HTML 5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;
codec situation is so important. If Theora and Vorbis are standardized here,
and all the major browsers (except Internet Explorer, of course) were to
support it, then users who want to have those videos on the personal
portable media players would ask the companies to add support for them.
Things would probably snowball from there.

</I>I would like to point out that we do have one of the most influential
hardware manufacturers participating in this: Apple. If they asked for
Theora hardware decoders, they would get them. Which annoys me so much..
They would have quite a lot to gain from supporting Theora, and they refuse
to. If they added Theora and Vorbis to the default set of QuickTime codecs,
then everybody would be happy, since Safari uses QuickTime.

As for the hardware thing, Apple's iPod is the most popular portable media
player. So, any hardware decoder chip manufacturer would be salivating to
get a contract with Apple, and if Apple requested a chip for Theora
decoding, then companies would get it done pronto in hopes of winning a
contract bid with Apple. Then other companies needing hardware decoders for
Theora could get them too.

As it is, Apple is stonewalling efforts to convince them to support Theora
and Vorbis. Additionally, the Theora spec was only finalized last November,
you can't expect all the companies around the world to announce hardware
Theora decoders the next day or something? They need a business case and an
opportunity. The opportunity is here. The business case would be the simple
fact people want to be able to watch videos like Dailymotion, Archive.org,
or Wikimedia ones on their portable media devices. From this desire, profit
could be made in making these chips and selling them to portable media
player makers.
