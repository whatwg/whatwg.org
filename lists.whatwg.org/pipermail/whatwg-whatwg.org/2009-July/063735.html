I guess that couldn't have happened, because .length counted only the
unique tokens.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. I've made DOMTokenList not remove duplicates.
</I>
ok, I realize now that this is about the duplicates in .length and item().

By the way, preserving duplicates shouldn't be much code complexity if
I'm not mistaken.

The only required code change would be to use a hashset when parsing
the attribute in order to only insert unique tokens in the token
vector. Then DOMTokenList.length would return the token vector length
and .item() get the token by index. I don't think anything actually
depends on keeping duplicate tokens in the token vector. Then there
would be a small perf hit when parsing attributes with more than one
token.

&gt;&gt;<i> To summarize:

</I>
I don't think changing the underlying string is related to that
algorithm (from an implementation point of view). On setting, the
tokens would be deleted and the attribute parsed again.

</I>
The remove() algorithm is about 50 lines with whitespace and comments.
After all, that's not a big cost and I guess that preserving
whitespace may be closer to what DOMTokenList API consumers would
expect.
