I haven't removed HTMLCollection.tags yet, since it appears to be 
implemented by most browsers. If we can get Opera and WebKit to remove 
support, then I'll remove it from the spec.

Right now the HTML5 spec calls the document.all HTMLCollection 
&quot;HTMLAllCollection&quot;, since I have no way to override the name, and I can't 
have two names the same. I'm not sure what the prototype of document.all 
is if it's not the same as document.images... in fact this whole area is 
quite confusing to me. So I haven't done any the confusingness and just 
made them distinct.
