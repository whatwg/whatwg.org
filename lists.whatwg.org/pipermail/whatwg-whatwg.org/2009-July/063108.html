Fair enough. Done.



&gt;<i> There's similar oddness with receiving events that satisfy the MessageEvent

</I>&gt;<i> don't see the value in receiving something more complex.
</I>
I would like to avoid introducing four different event types for the four 
different types of 'message' events being introduced, which is why I 
overloaded the same interface for all four. I don't think it's a problem.


&gt;<i> 1) The 'readyState' attribute can never actually be used by an application
</I>&gt;<i> and is redundant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Initially, the 'readyState' attribute is set to CONNECTING, but while 
</I>&gt;<i> the object is in this state the user is not permitted to interact with 
</I>&gt;<i> the WebSocket in any way.  The only useful thing that a user could do is 
</I>&gt;<i> set event handlers and wait for the 'open' event to fire.  When the 
</I>&gt;<i> WebSocket becomes connected, the readyState becomes 1 and the 'open' 
</I>&gt;<i> event is fired. Once the WebSocket is open, the spec states that 
</I>&gt;<i> whenever the connection is closed the readyState changes to CLOSED and a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'close' event is enqueued. However, users can't usefully check the 
</I>&gt;<i> readyState to see if the WebSocket is still open because there are not 
</I>&gt;<i> and cannot be any synchronization guarantees about when the WebSocket 
</I>&gt;<i> may close.  A user will have to wrap all calls to postMessage() (or 
</I>&gt;<i> send() if the function is renamed) in a try/catch block in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> handle INVALID_STATE_ERRs.  Once the 'close' event has been received the 
</I>&gt;<i> readyState attribute is useless since the state of the WebSocket is 
</I>&gt;<i> known and can never change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think 'readyState' should just go away since an application will have 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep track of state updates through the fired events and use 
</I>&gt;<i> try/catch blocks around all API calls anyway.
</I>
The attribute is mostly present for debugging purposes. I wouldn't expect 
anyone to actually use it for production work.

</I>
I've changed the spec to not throw an exception on send() if the 
connection is closed.

</I>
send() doesn't report I/O errors, it only throws an exception if the 
connection isn't open yet (and previously, if the connection had died 
prior to it being called, though that is no longer the case), or if the 
input is invalid.


&gt;<i> I'm also not sure there is good coverage of error conditions in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec. The only methods of error notification are exceptions in 
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage and onclose.
</I>
In fact, only onclose actually reports an error; the exception from send() 
now only reports a misuse of the API, not a network error.


&gt;<i> I had assumed that a WebSocket that fails to connect would invoke 
</I>&gt;<i> onclose asynchronously, but I didn't see that in the spec.
</I>
It's there, though subtle. :-)

The constructor in the API spec invokes the &quot;Establish a Web Socket 
connection&quot; algorithm from the protocol spec. That algorithm then invokes 
the &quot;fail the Web Socket connection&quot; algorithm upon failure, and that 
algorithm says to invoke the &quot;close the Web Socket connection&quot; algorithm, 
and that algorithm says that this means that &quot;Web Socket connection is 
closed&quot;, and the API spec says &quot;When the Web Socket connection is closed, 
the readyState attribute's value must be changed to CLOSED (2), and the 
user agent must queue a task to fire a simple event called close at the 
WebSocket object&quot;.

I've added a note that says this.


&gt;<i> Without that you don't even have the ability to know if a 
</I>&gt;<i> socket failed to establish a connection (short of readyState polling). 
</I>&gt;<i> The spec also doesn't indicate that the readyState should transition to 
</I>&gt;<i> CLOSED on connection failure.
</I>
This is part of the same sequence of events as described above.

I've renamed disconnect() to close() in both EventSource and WebSocket.

If you want acknowledgements, implement app-level acks -- in practice, 
there's not much difference between hitting the network or not, if the 
other side hasn't yet received the packets.


&gt;<i> postMessage() may want another exception condition... 'too much data

</I>
The spec doesn't specify how UAs are to handle hitting hardware 
limitations or system limitations, because it's often difficult to truly 
control how those cases are handled.

</I>
I've left it as is (the attribute changes on the fly), which is possibly 
risky, but more consistent with how such attributes are handled in 
general.


&gt;<i> I think a better way to do error handling is to have an asynchronous 
</I>&gt;<i> onerror callback or event when the browser notes that a message did not 
</I>&gt;<i> make it to the other side.
</I>
The client can't really always know this anyway. I think it's better to do 
app-level acking if you care enough.

</I>
If we had access to the underlying TCP packets, I guess we could return a 
number with each send() and have some way to query the number of the 
mesage that the most recent packet that got all the way to other side 
contained, but in practice I don't think that implementations are always 
going to have access to that, and also it's not just that the other stack 
got the message that matters, but that the remote server actually got the 
messages and processed it.

I think when we add support for file upload, we'll make it so that it 
automagically supports this case. That is, you'll say &quot;upload this file in 
small bits&quot; and then if you later say &quot;send this text message&quot;, the text 
message will be sent before any pending file bits. We can use a separate 
type of packet in the WebSocket stream to do this.
