</I>&gt;<i> do pullquotes, but I can't deduce the logic that makes it obvious why 
</I>&gt;<i> one should use an &lt;aside&gt; rather than &lt;figure&gt;; the definition of each 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to allow either to be used thus.
</I>
&lt;aside&gt; is defined as follows:

# The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of 
# content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside 
# element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such 
# sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
#
# The element can also be used for typographical effects like pull quotes.

&lt;figure&gt; is defined as follows:

# The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a 
# caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single 
# unit from the main flow of the document.
#
# The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, 
# photos, code listings, etc, that are referred to from the main content 
# of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the 
# document, be moved away from that primary content, e.g. to the side of 
# the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.

I don't really know how to make it clearer.

At the end of the day it doesn't really matter if &lt;figure&gt; is used for 
pull quotes (it's not really that inappropriate, and if it were the only 
thing &lt;aside&gt; were to be used for, I'd have suggested dropping &lt;aside&gt; and 
leaving pull quotes to &lt;figure&gt; anyway). Pull quotes are kind of a middle 
ground which (notwithstanding the explicit statement in the spec saying 
that &lt;aside&gt; is more appropriate for pull quotes) could probably be argued 
either way.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For example, in the middle of a fictional interview about markup, I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; might want to pull out a quote and citation: Do I write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;aside&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;After a sip of sweet sherry, I turn into Mr Last
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Week&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;cite&gt;Ian Hickson&lt;/cite&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;/aside&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;figure&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;After a sip of sweet sherry, I turn into Mr Last
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Week&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;legend&gt;Ian Hickson&lt;/legend&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;/figure&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The former shows correct usage of &lt;aside&gt; vs &lt;figure&gt;, though the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;cite&gt; element usage is incorrect; the name should not be marked up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I see no spec-derived reason why it should be &lt;aside&gt; rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;figure&gt;, other than it happens to be given an example of one rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than the other.
</I>
Well it says &quot;The element can also be used for typographical effects like 
pull quotes&quot;, which is the main reason. :-)

However, at the end of the day, the second markup snippet there isn't 
especially wrong either, it's just not the preferred way (which was more 
or less arbitrarily chosen in this case).


&gt;<i> (Given that marking up a name as a citation is common practice, and 
</I>&gt;<i> validator cannot distinguish between a name and a title of a work, 
</I>&gt;<i> should we widen the definition of &lt;cite&gt; to match the &quot;English language&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> defintion &quot;1. to quote or refer to (a passage, book, or author)&quot; ? A 
</I>&gt;<i> different discussion, apologies)
</I>
&lt;cite&gt; in HTML5 is defined to mean &quot;title of work&quot; based on current usage, 
rather than having anything to do with actual citations.
