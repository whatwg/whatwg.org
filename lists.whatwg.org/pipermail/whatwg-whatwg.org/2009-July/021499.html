</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allowing a background page to continue running after the visible page has

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, the first part sounds like it alone would be useful to web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications like GMail:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The first, which should begenerally useful, is the ability to have a
</I>&gt;<i> hidden
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTML/JS page running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the background that can access the DOM of visible windows. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page should be accessible from windows that the user navigates to. We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call this background Javascript window a &quot;shared context&quot; or a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;background page&quot;. This will enable multiple instances of a web app
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e.g. tearoff windows in Gmail) to cleanly access the same user state
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no matter which windows are open.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + restrict things to the same security origin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It sounds similar in concept to a share worker except that it runs in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; main thread and is more concerned with dom manipulation/state while
</I>&gt;<i> workers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have typically been thought of as allowing background processing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems that the lifetime of this could be scoped, so that it dies when
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't referenced (in a similar way to how shared worker lifetime is
</I>&gt;<i> scoped).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This idea actually sounds reasonably ok, and I think I once proposed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like this as an alternative to shared workers as the way for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple app instances to share state and computation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's really the bit about invisibly continuing to run once all related
</I>&gt;<i> web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages are closed that I would worry about the security issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only concern I see with this is that it permanently forces all
</I>&gt;<i> windows from the same domain to run in the same process. As things
</I>&gt;<i> stand today, if the user opens two tabs (or windows) and navigates to
</I>&gt;<i> the two different pages on www.example.com, then a browser could if it
</I>&gt;<i> so wished use separate processes to run those two pages. If we enabled
</I>&gt;<i> this API the two pages would have to run in the same process, even if
</I>&gt;<i> neither page actually used this new API.
</I>&gt;<i>

There are conflicting requirements along these lines that would need to be
resolved...

1) A nested iframe needs to run in the same process as its containing page.
2) A shared context needs to run in the same process as its client pages.

... but what if a nested iframe document in processA connects to a
sharedContext that has already been loaded into processB. Somethings gotta
give.

What if a sharedContext isn't gauranteed to be a singleton in the browser. A
browser can provide best effort at co-locating pages and sharedContexts, but
it can't gaurantee that, and the spec respects that.

The lesser gaurantee is that all directly scriptable pages (those from a
given set of related browsing contexts) WILL share the same sharedContext
(should the refer to it).
