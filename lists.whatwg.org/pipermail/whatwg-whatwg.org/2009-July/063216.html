Ah, ok. Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; The long and short of this is that if we solve this problem today, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution will be abused as much as the current API, and we'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduce yet another solution when high-res backing stores are common. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead I'm hoping that (a) authors won't screw this up, and (b) high-res
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backing stores will be implemented sooner rather than later. If we fail with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a), which is more likely if (b) is delayed, then we'll just introduce a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; higher-res API later, and designate this one a lost cause.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  This was sort of discussed in a follow-on thread to my mail, but my 
</I>&gt;<i> last comment about there being two fundamentally different use cases for 
</I>&gt;<i> PutImageData never got any responses... [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was the first use I tried to put canvas to: visualizing something by 
</I>&gt;<i> computing color values for pixels and then painting to the canvas (in my 
</I>&gt;<i> case Julia sets).
</I>
Yeah, I guess if you want to generate low-res bitmap data using an 
array-like API, the current &lt;canvas&gt; doesn't really help you.


&gt;<i> &gt; The putImageData() API is really intended for filters and generated 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patterns, both of which would want to be as high-res as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People are using it for things that are not filters or generated 
</I>&gt;<i> patterns as we speak...  And generally getting it wrong (in the sense 
</I>&gt;<i> that their stuff will break on high-res displays).
</I>
Not much we can do about that yet.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's not that hard, it's an extra four or five lines of code to fill

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; expression or two to work out what the limit is). Compared to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; maths such code would be doing anyway, this is trivial stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The hard part is realizing you have to do it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And in particular, the fact that it's not just filling in multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> pixels in a square...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For another example, consider an algorithm that wants to reduce the size of
</I>&gt;<i> the image by 1px horizontally (e.g. content-aware image resizing as demoed

</I>&gt;<i> If we're shrinking by one device pixel, then suddenly we can't even create a
</I>&gt;<i> canvas of the right size for the new image, because canvas size is specified
</I>&gt;<i> in integer CSS pixels.  Note that the algorithm used here, basically
</I>&gt;<i> off-the-shelf, would in fact want to work on device pixels the way the spec is
</I>&gt;<i> written right now; in general it would want to work on whatever pixels
</I>&gt;<i> imagedata is in.
</I>
If you want to shrink an image, redraw it using drawImage() with different 
dimensions.


&gt;<i> If we want to shrink by one CSS pixel, so we can actually draw the 
</I>&gt;<i> canvas, then each shrink step needs to apply the algorithm N times, 
</I>&gt;<i> right?  But what if N is, say, 2.5, as it can be in Safari?  It's been 
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out before that 1 css pixel can map to a fractional number of 
</I>&gt;<i> device pixels there...  That algorithm can't very well be applied 2.5 
</I>&gt;<i> times.  Of course my Julia set example would also need to do something a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot more interesting than just &quot;fill in multiple pixels in a square&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> when the css-to-device pixel ratio is non-integral.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I don't have a proposed solution here; I'm just pointing out 
</I>&gt;<i> that the authoring pitfalls here are a lot more complicated than you 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to give them credit for.
</I>
Yeah, I can see that there are cases that are a lot more complex than it 
would first seem.

I don't know what we can do about it either, though.

Do 1. The earlier the better, because if we do it now we can still break 
pages without huge problems, and if we do, we might get away with using 
this API without having to introduce a new one later.

So please, if you are at all able to, do 1, as soon as possible.
