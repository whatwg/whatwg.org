And I'm saying it's incompatible with IE in precisely the way that's 
unacceptable to me as an implementor, I guess.... I'm also not sure that 
the IE compat is important here; we've had no reports of compat issues 
with not doing what IE does.

</I>
I haven't internalized your parsing algorithm rules, but my intuition 
given the one compat requirement I know of here (not blowing away 
documents in cases where IE doesn't blow them away) is that deferred 
scripts should be treated as if the &lt;script&gt; tags appeared in the HTML 
character stream after all the content that is actually there...  That 
is, immediately before the EOF point.

&gt;<i> One alternative would be to make the scripts that have &quot;src&quot; attributes

</I>&gt;<i> them do the old behaviour
</I>
I could probably live with that, for what it's worth, but I'm still 
wondering why we need this innerHTML behavior at all.  innerHTML doesn't 
even run scripts it directly inserts; why would it run some other random 
script?

That said, if for compat we need this I can see doing it...

&gt;<i> But it's less compatible with IE than I usually try to be (I would have 
</I>&gt;<i> specced this innerHTML behaviour long ago if I'd thought to test for it).
</I>
Again, what you specced is also incompatible with IE, and the precise 
incompatibility is the issue I (and apparently Maciej) have with it.
