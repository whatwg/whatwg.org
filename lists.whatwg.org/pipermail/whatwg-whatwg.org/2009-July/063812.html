Which part specifically are you saying should be changed? I'm not sure I 
follow.


&gt;<i> In any event this is inconsistent with
</I>&gt;<i> 2.4.4.2, which says
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If position is not past the end of input, return to the top of step 9
</I>&gt;<i> in the overall algorithm (that's the step within which these substeps
</I>&gt;<i> find themselves).&quot;
</I>
I guess I didn't screw that one up yet. :-) I originally wrote algorithms 
using numeric step jumps, then when editing them I broke a bunch of jumps 
(adding steps but not updating numbers), and so whenever I edit an 
algorithm now, I make it symbolic rather than numeric.


&gt;<i> Either both should say &quot;the top of step 9&quot; or both should say &quot;the top
</I>&gt;<i> of the step labeled loop&quot;.
</I>
There is value in not changing them unless they are actually broken -- 
when I edit the spec, there's always a risk I'll break something.


&gt;<i> I don't see the value in the whole &quot;in the overall algorithm . . .&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> part, since in context there's no ambiguity with just giving the number.
</I>
For now -- what if I later add a dozen more substeps?


&gt;<i> &quot;If sign is &quot;positive&quot;, return value, otherwise return 0-value.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I initially read &quot;0-value&quot; as a single word, like &quot;p-value&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever.  Perhaps it should have spaces to make it more immediately
</I>&gt;<i> obvious that it's subtraction (&quot;0 - value&quot;).
</I>
I've rephrased this.


&gt;<i> In 2.6.2:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The specification says that user agents may serve HTTPS content as 
</I>&gt;<i> though it were unencrypted.  For instance, an example states: &quot;If a user 
</I>&gt;<i> connects to a server with a self-signed certificate, the user agent 
</I>&gt;<i> could allow the connection but just act as if there had been no 
</I>&gt;<i> encryption.&quot;  If this is done, however, man-in-the-middle attacks become 
</I>&gt;<i> trivial, unless the user is expected to notice the lack of encryption 
</I>&gt;<i> (unlikely).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, suppose a user navigates to PayPal and bookmarks it. 
</I>&gt;<i> PayPal is configured so if you try using HTTP (e.g., typing &quot;paypal.com&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> in the URL bar), it will redirect to HTTPS.  Therefore the user will 
</I>&gt;<i> bookmark a URL such as <A HREF="https://www.paypal.com/.">https://www.paypal.com/.</A>  Now suppose the user 
</I>&gt;<i> later attempts to access this site from the bookmark with a MITM present 
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., a free wireless router placed in a public place by a malicious 
</I>&gt;<i> person).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The router can intercept the HTTPS request, make its own identical HTTPS 
</I>&gt;<i> request, and return the results to the original HTTPS request, but 
</I>&gt;<i> signed with its own key instead of the original.  If the user agent 
</I>&gt;<i> behaves as described in the example, the only way for the user to notice 
</I>&gt;<i> this is to notice that the URL bar looks different, or whatever visual 
</I>&gt;<i> cue the browser uses.  If the user agent raises a prominent scary 
</I>&gt;<i> warning or even makes it difficult for the user to continue, on the 
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, there's no way for the attacker to prevent this, AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The section should prohibit user agents from displaying self-signed 
</I>&gt;<i> pages without at least giving a warning.  Or, at a minimum, it should 
</I>&gt;<i> strongly discourage it.  Currently it seems to indicate that this 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior is acceptable.  As far as I know, existing browsers all present 
</I>&gt;<i> scary warnings for self-signed pages (probably so scary as to be 
</I>&gt;<i> misleading, in fact, but that's a separate issue).
</I>
I've required UAs to catch this case and added this example.


&gt;<i> In 2.7:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;User agents must at a minimum support the UTF-8 and Windows-1252
</I>&gt;<i> encodings, but may support more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It is not unusual for Web browsers to support dozens if not upwards
</I>&gt;<i> of a hundred distinct character encodings.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why aren't the most important ones listed as requirements?
</I>
They are. UTF-8 and 1252 are the most important ones.


&gt;<i> This seems to be contrary to the usual HTML 5 philosophy of mandating 
</I>&gt;<i> (or at least precisely specifying) existing behavior that's required for 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility.
</I>
Which others are needed for compatibility?
