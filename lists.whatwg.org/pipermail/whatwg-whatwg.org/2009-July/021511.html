If the application code (HTML, JS, CSS) is all the same for two users, 
then appcache works for multiple users by just having the data for the 
users separate from the logic.

This is the expected model for most apps. For example, your typical blog 
has just one set of CSS for all users.

For systems where the user affects what HTML, JS, and CSS is served back, 
the spec as written pretty much requires that there be one app per user, 
and one generic &quot;login&quot; app that then redirects to one of those other apps 
-- and where each app has a different base URL, separate manifest, etc.

I think conceptually that's actually not a bad idea anyway, to be honest. 
However, I could see that it might not be the preferred model.

An alternative that we could explore in a future version is to have the 
manifest include a manifest name, and then have script that allows you to 
&quot;activate&quot; a particular manifest name for a given appcache.

So each appcache group would be futher subdivided into named subgroups, 
and for a given manifest URL with such a group of subgroups, one subgroup 
would be the default one at a time. The inactive ones would just lie 
dormant, but and the active ones would act like now, but there'd be a 
scripted way to change the default (and maybe query what available 
variants exist for the current appcache), so that you could log back in as 
someone else by just making the script pick the other user's variant, and 
then reloading.

I've noted this in the spec as a possible v2 feature.
