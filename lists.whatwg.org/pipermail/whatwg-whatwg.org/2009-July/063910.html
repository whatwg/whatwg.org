<PRE>So use an out-of-band extension mechanism to establish trust and
permissioning for capabilities that fall out of bounds of the 'regular' web
model.
So lets put that to practice on this particular two-part proposal...

&gt;<i> Our proposed solution has two parts.
</I>
This first part (below) falls within the bounds of the 'regular' web model.
Would be nice to discuss this on the merits in absense of the 'scary trust
permissioning' issues.

&gt;<i> The first, which should be
</I>&gt;<i> generally useful, is the ability to have a hidden HTML/JS page running
</I>&gt;<i> in the background that can access the DOM of visible windows. This
</I>&gt;<i> page should be accessible from windows that the user navigates to. We
</I>&gt;<i> call this background Javascript window a &quot;shared context&quot; or a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;background page&quot;. This will enable multiple instances of a web app
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. tearoff windows in Gmail) to cleanly access the same user state
</I>&gt;<i> no matter which windows are open.
</I>
This second part (below) would only be accessible after out-of-band trust
and permissioning mechansims got tickled.

&gt;<i> Additionally, we'd like this background page to continue to run after
</I>&gt;<i> the user has navigated away from the site, and preferably after the
</I>&gt;<i> user has closed the browser. This will enable us to keep client-side
</I>&gt;<i> data up-to-date on the user's machine. It will also enable us to
</I>&gt;<i> download JS in advance. When the user navigates to a web app, all the
</I>&gt;<i> background page has to do is draw the DOM in the visible window. This
</I>&gt;<i> should significantly speed up app startup. Additionally, when
</I>&gt;<i> something happens that requires notification, the background page can
</I>&gt;<i> launch a visible page with a notification (or use other rich APIs for
</I>&gt;<i> showing notifications).
</I>
(aside... begs the question... when will that extension mechanism be
standardized :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the error here is viewing this as a UX issue - if it were just a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this sounds dangerous - make sure you wrap it with the same permissions UI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we have for extensions, plugins, and binary downloads&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The realization I came to this morning is that the core of the objections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not primarily about protecting users (although this is one goal), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more about protecting the current secure web browsing model (Linus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explicitly said this yesterday in his email to the list, but I only &quot;got it&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when thinking about it today).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is why people are OK with supporting this via extensions but not OK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with supporting this as part of the core HTML APIs even if the UX was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly the same. It's more about keeping the model pristine. Doing crazy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff in extensions and plugins are OK because they are viewed as falling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outside the model (they are just random scary things that user agents choose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do that don't conform to the specification).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So arguing &quot;but it's the same UI either way!&quot; is not going to convince

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It seems the biggest concern in this discussion is around &quot;BotNet

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> full-powered platform API persistently in the background, w/o a visible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 'page' in some window.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This concern is clear. But what could be a direction to the solution?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Assuming one of the goals for html5 is reducing a gap in capabilities
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> between web apps and native apps, how do we move forward with more powerful
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> APIs?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So far, multiple ways exist to gain access to the user's machine - nearly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all of them based on some dialog that asks user to make impossible decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - as bad as it is, binary downloads, plugins, browser extensions, axtivex
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> controls or Gears modules are all but a dialog away from the user's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> computer. Basically, if a malicious dudes are cool to write native apps -
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they can have their botnet relatively easy. The ongoing fight with malware
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and viruses will continue - not because the platforms have wrong API, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because it's really hard to give power to the apps and not to the malware,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> since they, in essence, do the very similar things.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As controversial as it sounds, it might be if a web platform API can't be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used to write a botnet, then it can't be used to write a wide class of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> powerful applications as well :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't have a botnet example, but when Safari 4 visits the sites in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> background (to keep the 'new tab page' site snapshots up-to-date) w/o ever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> asking my permission - it looks a bit scary, because I'm not sure I want it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to visit websites at random time from my IP with I don't know what cookies
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and then snapshot the result in jpg and store it locally... But I sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like the feature anyways. Now, how can I make a web app that does this? Some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sort of background shared page could be handy. It can pop up the same dialog
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when installed, live in Applications folder but it should be possible. Now
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if we make it possible, would it be possible to write a botnet on top of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> API? Of course! Same exact way as it's possible to write even better botnet
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on OSX API in which Safari is written.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now, what if I want the same feature but implemented not as a native app,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but as a web app? We would need to give it specific rights locally, and make
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the process transparent - not only on 'install' time but when it runs too -
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so the user could peek into some 'task manager' and clearly see if such
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thing is running. Browser could periodically download 'malware lists' and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kill those web apps that are in it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But for now, it should be ok to have it 'installed' with a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> browser dialog that asks the user to make a decision the user may not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> understand - it is not the ideal way but it is the common way today, users
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know they are asked these questions, admins and IT teaches users what to do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when asked, so it's the best we can do now. Having a 'task manager' (as in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Chrome) reflecting those things is good too.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Btw, if it only can do window.open() on the url from the same domain,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then if it's from Gmail then it can't be used or hijaked.  If it is from a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> site that says install this and I'll show you a pretty picture and user
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> clicks through a dialog, I'd say it's not a new vector for malware.
