readyState on Document and &lt;video&gt; aren't realy useful for anything but 
debugging either, as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> Also, maybe it should be noted as such in the spec?
</I>
I don't really see much benefit to including such a statement; if someone 
wants to use it for a non-debugging reason, why not do so?

I don't really understand what problem we would be trying to solve by 
changing that.


&gt;<i> One other random question:  in the IDL for WebSockets, the three

Fixed.

I've made it clear that if bytes can't be sent, the connection must be 
closed.


&gt;<i> However, I do not think that raising an exception is an appropriate

</I>
I think we are best off abstracting away this level of complexity from 
authors, especially since we'd need to make sure that data was not sent 
half-way through a UTF-8 sequence, and since the framing is under the 
control of the UA, not the application. There's no way to retry a 
partially-successful send() from the API here.


&gt;<i> 1) Web Sockets is specified to send whatever authentication credentials 
</I>&gt;<i> the client has for the resource. However, there is no challenge-response 
</I>&gt;<i> sequence specified, which seems to prevent using common auth schemes. 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP Basic needs to know an authentication realm for the credentials, 
</I>&gt;<i> and other schemes need a cryptographic challenge (e.g. nonce for Digest 
</I>&gt;<i> auth).
</I>
I expect to address this in more detail in a future version. For now, use 
in-band authentication in the WebSocket once you are connected. We may 
find that that is actually enough.


&gt;<i> 2) It is not specified what the server does when credentials are 
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect, so I assume that the intended behavior is to close the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection. Unlike HTTP 401 response, this doesn't give the client a 
</I>&gt;<i> chance to ask the user again. Also, if the server is on a different 
</I>&gt;<i> host, especially one that's not shared with an HTTP server, there isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> a way to obtain credentials, in the first place.
</I>
How we address this will likely depend on how we address the earlier 
point.


&gt;<i> 3) A Web Sockets server cannot respond with a redirect to another URL. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if the intention is to leave this to implementations, or to 
</I>&gt;<i> add in Web Sockets v2, but it definitely looks like an important feature 
</I>&gt;<i> to me, maybe something that needs to be in v1.
</I>
What's the use case? Why does this need to be at the connection layer 
rather than the application layer? (Why would we need this, when TCP 
doesn't have it? Would you also need &quot;redirect&quot;-like functonality in IRC, 
IMAP, SSH, and other such protocols?)


&gt;<i> 4) &quot;If the user agent already has a Web Socket connection to the remote 
</I>&gt;<i> host identified by /host/ (even if known by another name), wait until 
</I>&gt;<i> that connection has been established or for that connection to have 
</I>&gt;<i> failed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't look like &quot;host identified by /host/&quot; is defined anywhere. 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this requirement say that IP addresses should be compared, instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of host names?
</I>
Right. I've tried to clarify this.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure if this is significant for preventing DoS attacks, and 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, the IP address may not be known before a request is sent. This 
</I>&gt;<i> puts an unusual burden on the implementation.
</I>
Without this requirement, you can just have a DNS server return the victim 
IP for a wildcard DNS entry, and then just have attackers open connections 
to thousands of &quot;hosts&quot;.


&gt;<i> 5) We probably need to specify a keep-alive feature to avoid proxy 
</I>&gt;<i> connection timeout. I do not have factual data on whether common proxies 
</I>&gt;<i> implement connection timeout, but I'd expect them to often do.
</I>
This seems like something that would be easy to deal with at the 
application layer, if desired.


&gt;<i> 6) The spec should probably explicitly permit blocking some ports from 
</I>&gt;<i> use with Web Sockets at UA's discretion. In practice, the list would 
</I>&gt;<i> likely be the same as for HTTP, see e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html</A>&gt;.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> 7) &quot;use a SOCKS proxy for WebSocket connections, if available, or failing
</I>&gt;<i> that, to prefer an HTTPS proxy over an HTTP proxy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not clear what definition of proxy types is used here. To me, an HTTPS
</I>&gt;<i> proxy is one that supports CONNECT to port 443, and an HTTP proxy (if we're
</I>&gt;<i> making a distinction from HTTPS) is one that intercepts and forwards GET
</I>&gt;<i> requests. However, this understanding contradicts an example in paragraph
</I>&gt;<i> 3.1.3, and also, it's not clear how a GET proxy could be used for Web Sockets.
</I>
Clarified, I hope.


&gt;<i> 8) Many HTTPS proxies only allow connecting to port 443. Do you have the 
</I>&gt;<i> data on whether relying on existing proxies to establish connections to 
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary ports is practical?
</I>
I do not. I expect most people to use direct connections over port 81 or 
TLS over port 443, as discussed in the introduction.


&gt;<i> 9) &quot;There is no limit to the number of established Web Socket 
</I>&gt;<i> connections a user agent can have with a single remote host&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this mean that Web Socket connections are exempt from the normal 
</I>&gt;<i> 4-connection (or so) limit? Why is it OK?
</I>
That limit is an HTTP limit. WebSocket is not an HTTP protocol, so the 
limit has no bearing on WebSocket.

As I understand it, the limit in HTTP is intended to deal with the problem 
of multiple short-lived connections being needed to render a page, e.g. 
going to a Web page with thousands of &lt;img&gt;s. There would be no way for 
the author to ensure the page didn't DOS the server in such a case. This 
is not a concern with WebSocket, where the author controls when the 
connections are made.


&gt;<i> 10) Web Socket handshake uses CRLF line endings strictly. Does this add 
</I>&gt;<i> much to security? It prevents using telnet/netcat for debugging, which 
</I>&gt;<i> is something I personally use often when working on networking issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no practical reason for this, I'd suggest relaxing this 
</I>&gt;<i> aspect of parsing.
</I>
Do you mean client-&gt;server or server-&gt;client?


&gt;<i> 11) There is no way for the client to know that the connection has been
</I>&gt;<i> closed. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> - socket.close() is called from JavaScript;
</I>&gt;<i> - onclose handler is invoked;
</I>&gt;<i> - more data arrives from the server, and onmessage is dispatched (which I
</I>&gt;<i> think is correct, and it matches what TCP does);
</I>&gt;<i> - finally, a TCP FIN arrives, indicating that there will be no more data from
</I>&gt;<i> the server (the underlying TCP connection is in TIME_WAIT state after that);
</I>&gt;<i> - the client never learns that the server is done sending data.
</I>
The onclose only fires once the connection has closed, which is after the 
TCP FIN, so it happens after the last 'message' event.


&gt;<i> As Web Sockets are basically at the same level as TCP, and TCP provides 
</I>&gt;<i> complete info about socket state, I don't think that delegating 
</I>&gt;<i> connection closing to app-level protocols would be appropriate.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean.

Indeed.

</I>
I've added an attribute that says how much data has been buffered, so an 
application can tell if this number is rising unexpectedly.


&gt;<i> An example where adapting to network bandwidth is needed is of course

</I>
We may have to do more complex things when we introduce files and streams, 
but in practice I expect those to be a non-issue since the UA would take 
care of them completely with just one send() call.

   function upload(file) {
     websocket.send(file);
   }

   websocket.startSendingStream(camera.stream);
   ...
   websocket.stopSendingStream(camera.stream);

...or something. Those are in fact far easier to deal with than just 
continuous updates of the user's progress in a game or some such.

</I>
Running out of space is hitting a hardware limitation, at which point you 
can do whatever you like (the spec doesn't require any particular 
behaviour in such scenarios, since what is possible depends on the UA).

I have, however, made the spec clear that if the send() fails somehow, the 
connection must be closed.

I think returning a boolean is more or less the same as &quot;silently 
dropping&quot; in practice.

Agreed.

True. the .bufferedAmount attribute will now allow this.

Probably true also.

Without the recent changes, yes.


&gt;<i> Even worse, to be broadly deployable the app-level protocol would have

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;canWrite&quot; notification like other async socket APIs provide (or 
</I>&gt;<i> something similar) to avoid the clunky catch-and-retry idiom.
</I>
The attribute now lets you just wait until the buffer is empty, which is 
more or less equivalent, I think.

</I>
Both the lice stream and the file case are actually far easier for us to 
deal with, as noted above, than just lots of generated text data.

That's what I've done.
