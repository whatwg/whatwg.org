<PRE>the difficulty with a named-section option is that the manifest generation
for an application would have to know which users use a particular machine,
which is pretty much a non-starter.

&gt;<i> If the application code (HTML, JS, CSS) is all the same for two users,
</I>&gt;<i> then appcache works for multiple users by just having the data for the
</I>&gt;<i> users separate from the logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the expected model for most apps. For example, your typical blog
</I>&gt;<i> has just one set of CSS for all users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For systems where the user affects what HTML, JS, and CSS is served back,
</I>&gt;<i> the spec as written pretty much requires that there be one app per user,
</I>&gt;<i> and one generic &quot;login&quot; app that then redirects to one of those other apps
</I>&gt;<i> -- and where each app has a different base URL, separate manifest, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think conceptually that's actually not a bad idea anyway, to be honest.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I could see that it might not be the preferred model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An alternative that we could explore in a future version is to have the
</I>&gt;<i> manifest include a manifest name, and then have script that allows you to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;activate&quot; a particular manifest name for a given appcache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So each appcache group would be futher subdivided into named subgroups,
</I>&gt;<i> and for a given manifest URL with such a group of subgroups, one subgroup
</I>&gt;<i> would be the default one at a time. The inactive ones would just lie
</I>&gt;<i> dormant, but and the active ones would act like now, but there'd be a
</I>&gt;<i> scripted way to change the default (and maybe query what available
</I>&gt;<i> variants exist for the current appcache), so that you could log back in as
</I>&gt;<i> someone else by just making the script pick the other user's variant, and
</I>&gt;<i> then reloading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've noted this in the spec as a possible v2 feature.
