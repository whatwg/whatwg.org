Do we know why 1 and 2 are true? Can it be fixed?

Yes, but a background page keeps a lot of state in memory semi-permanently.
It's not acceptable for any web page to have the power to use significant
system resources even after it's been closed.

The most contentious part of this proposal is keeping the page open after
all it's parent pages have been closed. #3 only needs background pages to be
open as long as it's parent pages are open. #4 can be somewhat solved by
this, but there are other less resource intensive solutions to that as well.

Something like Aaron's proposal where &quot;the lifetime of the page could be
refcounted by pages referencing it&quot; seems reasonable though. It doesn't
solve the initial startup problem, but it does solve #3, which would allow
for making things like popping out an email to it's own window fast.

In addition, putting this behind an install UI like extensions seems fine to
fix the startup case and #4, although I agree that you shouldn't need to
&quot;install gmail&quot; for it to load quickly.

I'd like to understand the underlying reasons for #1 and #2. As Jonas said,
there may be alternative solutions that are less prone to abuse of system
resources. For example is loading cached JS so slow because it needs to hit
disk? That could be solved by an AppCache extension that pins resources in
memory if possible.
