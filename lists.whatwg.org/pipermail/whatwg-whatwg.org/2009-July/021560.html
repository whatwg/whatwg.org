<PRE>I intended the &quot;resistant to malice and incompetence&quot; definition of safe,
not the idempotent definition of safe. Thanks for clarifying.
Even in a world of exceptionally sophisticated applications, now and in the
future, I think it is worth preserving the safe and stateless properties of
the web. The challenge is exposing new capabilities in a way that is
compatible with those properties.

Naively bringing over APIs from desktop apps may not always work. For
example, a typical desktop app can, at any time, read all of my files. Web
apps need access to files too, but I don't want every web page see all my
files. The &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; API and UI were designed to grant access to
only the files I want to make available, and do so in a way that is natural.
Even in this simple case there were subtle security issues that took years
to emerge and address.

We need to take a similar approach with other new capabilities without
adding a new install escape hatch to the web. For capabilities where we
aren't yet clever enough to come up with a safe and stateless solution,
using the existing install mechanism of extensions and their attendant
security features seems like a good way forward.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here's some security risks I've thought about, for persistent workers and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> persistent background pages:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) If they have general-purpose network access, they are a tool to build
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a DDOS botnet, or a botnet to launch attacks against vulnerable servers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) If they do not have general-purpose network access, this can be worked
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> around with DNS rebinding. Note that ordinarily, DNS rebinding is only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> considered a risk for content protect by network position. But in the case
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of a DDOS or attempt to hunt for server vulnerabilities, this doesn't matter
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - the attack doesn't depend on the DDOS node sending credentials.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) If they have notification capabilities, they can be used for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> advertising spam.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) If they have general network access only while a page from the same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> domain is displayed, then they can use a misleading notification to trick
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the user into going to a page on that domain, to gain network general
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> network access at the moment it's needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Even if they only have same-domain network access, they can be used to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create a botnet for computation - for example for purposes like distributed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> password cracking.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 6) They can be used to greatly extend the window of vulnerability from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visiting a malicious site once. Consider the model where a browser patches a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> security vulnerability, and users apply the patch over some period after
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's released. Assuming the vulnerability wasn't already known to attackers,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> users are at risk if they visit a malicious site in the period between
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> release of the patch and install of the patch. But with persistent workers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (or background pages) in the picture, users can be vulnerable if they have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *every* visited a malicious site - because it could have installed a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> persistent worker that periodically &quot;phones home&quot; for exploit code to try.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This can greatly increase the number of people who can be affected by a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> malicious web page, and therefore greatly increases the incentive to try
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> such a thing. This works even with just same-doman network access. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this risk is really serious because it makes every future browser
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vulnerability much more dangerous.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 7) Even with only same-domain network access, the persistent worker could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> periodically &quot;phone home&quot; to allow tracking of the user by IP, which can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mapped to an approximate physical location. Normally, a page you don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> open can't do that to you.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This list isn't necessarily exhaustive, I'm sure there's more risks I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> haven't thought of, but note that most of these problems are not resolved by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> limiting networking to same-domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think a permissions dialog could possibly adequately explain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> these risks, and in any case many users blindly click through alert dialogs.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The risks are subtle but nonetheless outside user expectations for a web
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do think offering a feature like this in the context of an application
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or extension style install experience might be acceptable - specifically an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experience that is explicitly initiated by the user with multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> affirmative steps. But web features are not usually designed around such an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expectation, usually this is the hallmark of a proprietary platform, at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> times also including central vetting and revocation capabilities.
