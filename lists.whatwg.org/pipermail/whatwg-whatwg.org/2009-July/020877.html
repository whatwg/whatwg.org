</I>
I mean that a conforming implementation should intrinsically know that the 
content is a heading, without having to do further processing to discover 
this.

For example, with this CSS and HTML:

   h1 { color: blue; }

   &lt;h1&gt; Introduction &lt;/h1&gt;

...the HTML processor knows, regardless of what else is going on, that the 
word &quot;Introduction&quot; is part of a heading. It only knows that the word 
should be blue after applying processing rules for CSS.

I think by and large the same should hold for more elaborate semantics.


(I didn't really agree with your other responses regarding my criticisms 
of your proposal either, but I don't have anything except my opinions to 
go on as far as those go, so I can't argue my case usefully there.)


&gt;<i> &gt; I think CRDF has a bright future in doing the kind of thing GRDDL does,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure about what GRDDL does: I just took a look through the spec,

</I>&gt;<i> a bad thing.
</I>
A good thing.

GRDDL is a way to take an HTML page and infer RDF information from that 
page despite the page, e.g. by &quot;implementing&quot; Microformats using XSLT. So 
for example, GRDDL can be used to extract hCard data from an HTML page and 
turn it into RDF data.


&gt;<i> &gt; It's an interesting way of converting, say, Microformats to RDF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ability to convert Microformats to RDF was intended (although not 
</I>&gt;<i> fully achieved: some &quot;bad&quot; content would be treated differently between 
</I>&gt;<i> CRDF and Microformats); and in the same way CRDF also provides the 
</I>&gt;<i> ability to define de-centralized Microformats.org-like vocabularies (I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> not sure if referring to these as &quot;microformats&quot; would still be 
</I>&gt;<i> appropiate).
</I>
I think this is a particularly useful feature; I would encourage you to 
continue to develop this idea as a separate language, and see if there is 
a market for it.


Cheers,
