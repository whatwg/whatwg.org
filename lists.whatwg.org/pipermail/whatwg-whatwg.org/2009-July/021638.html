</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Depends on the device. If you're on Android (or I suspect iPhone, although I
don't have one), doesn't the device sync your email constantly in the
background? If I am a web-based email provider, I would like to have a
similar option. Especially on something like the iPhone or Android, where I
don't think it's reasonable to expect them to keep the browser open all the
time (as the browser will just get closed if some other active app applies
memory pressure).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I think there are valid use cases for out-of-band
</I>&gt;<i> notifications, for example for calendar events or &quot;status update&quot; type
</I>&gt;<i> applications such as Facebook or Twitter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to explore whether we can accommodate this notification use case
</I>&gt;<i> without bringing the full power of the Web platform to bear, and thereby
</I>&gt;<i> opening up a lot of attack surface on the client. Here's one rough sketch of
</I>&gt;<i> an idea:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Notification Feeds *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Often, web applications would like to give users the option to subscribe to
</I>&gt;<i> notifications that occur at specific times or in response to server-side
</I>&gt;<i> events, and for the user to get these UI notifications without a
</I>&gt;<i> prerequisite that the web app is open or that the browser is running. There
</I>&gt;<i> may be a desire to do client-side computation as well, but often just the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to give the user a notification solves the basic user interaction
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One possible way to address this kind of use case is to let users subscribe
</I>&gt;<i> to a &quot;feed&quot; of notifications. This feed could use standard syndication
</I>&gt;<i> formats, such as RSS or Atom. But instead of being displayed in a
</I>&gt;<i> traditional feed reader, it's displayed in the form of transient
</I>&gt;<i> notifications (along the lines of Growl on Mac OS X) which are posted for
</I>&gt;<i> each new event. To allow some pre-scheduling of events, each item can have a
</I>&gt;<i> date and won't be displayed until that date - this way a calendar can give
</I>&gt;<i> you your feed of upcoming events and you can still get notifications when
</I>&gt;<i> offline. In the case of something like email or Twitter, obviously there's
</I>&gt;<i> no sensible way to get notifications when offline since they depend on
</I>&gt;<i> unpredeictable server-side activity. There could even be a client-side API
</I>&gt;<i> that lets a Web app schedule items on a subscribed notification feed from
</I>&gt;<i> script, to enable scheduling calendar events offline. Each notification
</I>&gt;<i> would have the option to unsubscribe from the notification feed, to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> spam potential.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that this opens up a lot less attack surface. The user has to
</I>&gt;<i> actively opt in to subscribing to the notification feed, just as for an RSS
</I>&gt;<i> feed. This makes it much less likely they end up with a subscription to a
</I>&gt;<i> shady site. And the notifications are passive data items (probably no script
</I>&gt;<i> should be allowed in a notification, if the format is HTML and not just
</I>&gt;<i> plain text), so they open up a lot less security risk. Obviously this is
</I>&gt;<i> less powerful than the ability to run arbitrary code in the background. But
</I>&gt;<i> it could address a large chunk of the use cases with much less security
</I>&gt;<i> risk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It addresses some use cases (calendar, perhaps), but I would still like to
be able to e.g. keep my email up to date. Do I need the &quot;full power&quot; /
&quot;fully general&quot; solution? I don't know, perhaps the push mechanism can be
structured in a way that it gets into my database or whatever storage
mechanism I am using for offline data storage?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like us to think along these kinds of lines when expanding the web
</I>&gt;<i> platform. Often there is a low-power alternative to fully general solutions,
</I>&gt;<i> which addresses many of the same use cases. By proceeding in this manner, we
</I>&gt;<i> can extend the power of the web platform without neutering its desirable
</I>&gt;<i> security properties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Maciej
