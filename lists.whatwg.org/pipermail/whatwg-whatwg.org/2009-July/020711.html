Only if people don't show restraint in extending the language.


&gt;<i> For example what use would a &lt;color&gt; element or a &lt;number&gt; element do?
</I>
It would allow conformance checkers to do type checking for the most 
commonly used types, and might allow (for number, anyway) localised 
formatting.


&gt;<i> If instead mashine readable values could be added using a generic 
</I>&gt;<i> method, such as a 'itemvalue' or 'propvalue' attribute, each microdata 
</I>&gt;<i> format can define how to interpret the values, be they numbers, dates, 
</I>&gt;<i> body parts, or chemical formulas.
</I>
You can do that now with &lt;meta itemprop=... content=...&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I even wonder it would allow replacing the &lt;time&gt; element with a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; standardized microformat, such as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Christmas is going down on &lt;span item=&quot;w3c.time&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; itemvalue=&quot;12-25-2009&quot;&gt;The 25th day of December&lt;span&gt;!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really understand how that would be better than dedicated 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea would be to reduce the size of the language. I.e. if a feature 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't heavily used, it might be better expressed as a microdata format. 
</I>
Well, you can do it today as:

   Christmas is going down on &lt;meta itemprop=&quot;w3c.time&quot; 
   content=&quot;12-25-2009&quot;&gt;The 25th day of December!

...which (assuming that in your example you meant &quot;itemprop&quot; and not 
&quot;item&quot;, and assuming that you didn't mean the contents of the &lt;span&gt; to 
have any effect on the microdata processing model) would result in exactly 
the same name/value pair being generated into the relevant item.

On the other hand, if you really meant item=&quot;&quot;, which I guess you might 
have meant... you could do that today as:

   Christmas is going down on &lt;span item=&quot;w3c.time&quot;&gt;&lt;meta itemprop=&quot;value&quot;
   content=&quot;12-25-2009&quot;&gt;The 25th day of December&lt;/span&gt;!

...or some such (it doesn't matter what the textual contents of the &lt;span&gt; 
are in this example). However, this is going to result in much more 
painful structures, and you'd still need to link the item with a parent 
item (assuming there is one), as in:

   &lt;div item=&quot;com.example.somethingorother&quot;&gt;
    Christmas is going down on &lt;span itemprop=&quot;com.example.startdate&quot; 
    item=&quot;w3c.time&quot;&gt;&lt;meta itemprop=&quot;value&quot; content=&quot;12-25-2009&quot;&gt;The 25th 
    day of December&lt;/span&gt;!
   &lt;/div&gt;

...which is really getting complicated compared to just:

   &lt;div item=&quot;com.example.somethingorother&quot;&gt;
    Christmas is going down on &lt;meta itemprop=&quot;w3c.time&quot; 
    content=&quot;12-25-2009&quot;&gt;The 25th day of December!
   &lt;/div&gt;

...or (preferred today):

   &lt;div item=&quot;com.example.somethingorother&quot;&gt;
    Christmas is going down on &lt;time itemprop=&quot;w3c.time&quot; 
    datetime=&quot;12-25-2009&quot;&gt;The 25th day of December&lt;/time&gt;!
   &lt;/div&gt;


&gt;<i> For example, why didn't you add elements for bibtex or vCard, but 
</I>&gt;<i> instead used microdata?
</I>
New elements didn't really fit the use cases as well.


&gt;<i> Another reason is as a test of the microdata feature itself. Microdata 
</I>&gt;<i> is a sort of extension mechanism to HTML 5. In software development, it 
</I>&gt;<i> is common to test your extension system by developing parts of the 
</I>&gt;<i> product using the extension system. This way you can both keep the core 
</I>&gt;<i> code small, and you get a good test bed for your extension system.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> You have already done this with the &quot;predefined vocabularies&quot;
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> and apparently the lack of ability to define a mashine readable value 
</I>&gt;<i> separate from the human readable one was not a problem. However it would 
</I>&gt;<i> seem that the same does not hold true for &lt;time&gt;.
</I>
Right, that's why I adapted &lt;time&gt; into the microdata model.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * Support for tabular data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would be nice if we can find a way to do it that doesn't put 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; undue burdens on simple implementations. (e.g. I would imagine that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while a microdata implementation today can be a few hundred lines 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; total, adding support for the table model could easily double that.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite possibly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In both these cases I'm perfectly happy to wait with adding more 
</I>&gt;<i> features to microdata for now and see if what we have is successful, 
</I>&gt;<i> before we start over engineering it to cover every imaginable case.
</I>
Agreed.
