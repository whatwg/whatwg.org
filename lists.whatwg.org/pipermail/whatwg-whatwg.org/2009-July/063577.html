The idea here is 'when in doubt, favor the more restrictive option.'  There shouldn't be both headers, but if there are, then CSP wins.


&gt;&gt;<i> There's already been some discussion that authors would iteratively relax CSP until their site worked.  I can see where an author enables ReportOnly, their site suddenly works and they mistakenly believe it's properly configured and actively protecting their site.

</I>&gt;<i> They might also make a typo in the policy file that causes Firefox to
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the whole thing, and mistakenly believe they're being
</I>&gt;<i> protected.
</I>
This won't happen as CSP explicitly enforces a 'fail closed' policy:

&gt;<i> Or they might enable CSP, then allow inline script and
</I>&gt;<i> import from arbitrary foreign sites because that's what it took for
</I>&gt;<i> their ads and Analytics to start working again, and think they're
</I>&gt;<i> protected.
</I>
Allowing content from their advertising and analytics providers is far less serious than mistakenly turning on ReportOnly which allows content from any source.

 
&gt;<i> You can't really do much to stop people from having a sense of false
</I>&gt;<i> security if they neither understand nor test their security system.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think it's valuable to try.
</I>
It's valuable to set them up for as much success as possible.
