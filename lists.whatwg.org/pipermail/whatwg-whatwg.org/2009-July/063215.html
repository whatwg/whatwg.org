</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Really, it's not that much work to make sure the API can have

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even if it is  never actually implemented in other languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not about whether it is a lot of work; it's about whether the

</I>&gt;<i> target language. Where this doesn't happen (as in much of the DOM),  
</I>&gt;<i> the API ends up feeling clunky and difficult to use. My experience  
</I>&gt;<i> with dom-equivalent APIs that have been designed to fully take  
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of the target language capabilities is that they are much  
</I>&gt;<i> more pleasant to use than the equivalent DOM APIs. Indeed one of the  
</I>&gt;<i> first things that most javascript libraries do is replace most of  
</I>&gt;<i> the DOM  with their own API. This hardly seems like a ringing  
</I>&gt;<i> endorsement of the design strategy that gave us the DOM. I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> think it is sensible to optimise for the few people for whom the  
</I>&gt;<i> cross-language* approach is convenient at the expense of the many or  
</I>&gt;<i> whom it is bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly it seems that canPlayType is going to be another hacky-feeling  
</I>&gt;<i> API because of cross-language considerations and because the  
</I>&gt;<i> problems with it were not picked up soon enough :(
</I>
We added support for the updated canPlayType API to WebKit last night  
-- eg. the empty string is returned instead of &quot;no&quot; -- this is now  
present in the latest nightlies and seems to work for the use case we  
are looking at eg. &quot;if (video.canPlayType(..)) ...&quot; now succeeds if  
support is possible, and fails otherwise.

&gt;<i> *I idly note that DOM seems entirely unsuited to some languages so  
</I>&gt;<i> it is only really cross-language to the extent that it can be  
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in any language where you can mimic the style of java.
</I>
I don't buy this -- WebKit generates DOM bindings for JS, Obj-C, and C+ 
+ and has work in progress on a C binding -- while you can argue that  
these are all imperative languages and no one has made bindings for  
(say) Haskell, I cannot myself see any reason why such would not be  
possible.
