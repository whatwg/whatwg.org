</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with Michael that send() should not silently drop data that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could not be sent. It is very easy to fill send buffers, and if bytes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get silently dropped, implementing app-level acks becomes quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've made it clear that if bytes can't be sent, the connection must be
</I>&gt;<i> closed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I do not think that raising an exception is an appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer. Often, the TCP implementation takes a part of data given to it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and asks to resubmit the rest later. So, just returning an integer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; result from send() would be best in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we are best off abstracting away this level of complexity from
</I>&gt;<i> authors, especially since we'd need to make sure that data was not sent
</I>&gt;<i> half-way through a UTF-8 sequence, and since the framing is under the
</I>&gt;<i> control of the UA, not the application. There's no way to retry a
</I>&gt;<i> partially-successful send() from the API here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Web Sockets is specified to send whatever authentication credentials
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the client has for the resource. However, there is no challenge-response
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sequence specified, which seems to prevent using common auth schemes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTTP Basic needs to know an authentication realm for the credentials,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and other schemes need a cryptographic challenge (e.g. nonce for Digest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; auth).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect to address this in more detail in a future version. For now, use
</I>&gt;<i> in-band authentication in the WebSocket once you are connected. We may
</I>&gt;<i> find that that is actually enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) It is not specified what the server does when credentials are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incorrect, so I assume that the intended behavior is to close the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection. Unlike HTTP 401 response, this doesn't give the client a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chance to ask the user again. Also, if the server is on a different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host, especially one that's not shared with an HTTP server, there isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a way to obtain credentials, in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How we address this will likely depend on how we address the earlier
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) A Web Sockets server cannot respond with a redirect to another URL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure if the intention is to leave this to implementations, or to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; add in Web Sockets v2, but it definitely looks like an important feature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to me, maybe something that needs to be in v1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the use case? Why does this need to be at the connection layer
</I>&gt;<i> rather than the application layer? (Why would we need this, when TCP
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have it? Would you also need &quot;redirect&quot;-like functonality in IRC,
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP, SSH, and other such protocols?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) &quot;If the user agent already has a Web Socket connection to the remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host identified by /host/ (even if known by another name), wait until
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that connection has been established or for that connection to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't look like &quot;host identified by /host/&quot; is defined anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does this requirement say that IP addresses should be compared, instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of host names?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. I've tried to clarify this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure if this is significant for preventing DoS attacks, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyway, the IP address may not be known before a request is sent. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; puts an unusual burden on the implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without this requirement, you can just have a DNS server return the victim
</I>&gt;<i> IP for a wildcard DNS entry, and then just have attackers open connections
</I>&gt;<i> to thousands of &quot;hosts&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) We probably need to specify a keep-alive feature to avoid proxy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection timeout. I do not have factual data on whether common proxies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement connection timeout, but I'd expect them to often do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like something that would be easy to deal with at the
</I>&gt;<i> application layer, if desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6) The spec should probably explicitly permit blocking some ports from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use with Web Sockets at UA's discretion. In practice, the list would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely be the same as for HTTP, see e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/PortBanning.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7) &quot;use a SOCKS proxy for WebSocket connections, if available, or failing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, to prefer an HTTPS proxy over an HTTP proxy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is not clear what definition of proxy types is used here. To me, an
</I>&gt;<i> HTTPS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proxy is one that supports CONNECT to port 443, and an HTTP proxy (if
</I>&gt;<i> we're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making a distinction from HTTPS) is one that intercepts and forwards GET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requests. However, this understanding contradicts an example in paragraph
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.1.3, and also, it's not clear how a GET proxy could be used for Web
</I>&gt;<i> Sockets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clarified, I hope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8) Many HTTPS proxies only allow connecting to port 443. Do you have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data on whether relying on existing proxies to establish connections to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arbitrary ports is practical?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not. I expect most people to use direct connections over port 81 or
</I>&gt;<i> TLS over port 443, as discussed in the introduction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9) &quot;There is no limit to the number of established Web Socket
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connections a user agent can have with a single remote host&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does this mean that Web Socket connections are exempt from the normal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4-connection (or so) limit? Why is it OK?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That limit is an HTTP limit. WebSocket is not an HTTP protocol, so the
</I>&gt;<i> limit has no bearing on WebSocket.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it, the limit in HTTP is intended to deal with the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of multiple short-lived connections being needed to render a page, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> going to a Web page with thousands of &lt;img&gt;s. There would be no way for
</I>&gt;<i> the author to ensure the page didn't DOS the server in such a case. This
</I>&gt;<i> is not a concern with WebSocket, where the author controls when the
</I>&gt;<i> connections are made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10) Web Socket handshake uses CRLF line endings strictly. Does this add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much to security? It prevents using telnet/netcat for debugging, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is something I personally use often when working on networking issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there is no practical reason for this, I'd suggest relaxing this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aspect of parsing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean client-&gt;server or server-&gt;client?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 11) There is no way for the client to know that the connection has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closed. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - socket.close() is called from JavaScript;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - onclose handler is invoked;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - more data arrives from the server, and onmessage is dispatched (which I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think is correct, and it matches what TCP does);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - finally, a TCP FIN arrives, indicating that there will be no more data
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the server (the underlying TCP connection is in TIME_WAIT state after
</I>&gt;<i> that);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - the client never learns that the server is done sending data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The onclose only fires once the connection has closed, which is after the
</I>&gt;<i> TCP FIN, so it happens after the last 'message' event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As Web Sockets are basically at the same level as TCP, and TCP provides
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete info about socket state, I don't think that delegating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection closing to app-level protocols would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that point, an exception is only needed if the implementation runs out

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be downgraded in quality for slow connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We may have to do more complex things when we introduce files and streams,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm assuming that no actual limits would be specified in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how much buffering it is willing to provide. Doesn't that imply that a

</I>&gt;<i> Without the recent changes, yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even worse, to be broadly deployable the app-level protocol would have

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as much data as possible until the system throws an exception, then set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a timer to retry the send in 100ms&quot; approach. But perhaps that's your

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no more than (say) 1MB of data outstanding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm just afraid that we're burdening the API to handle degenerative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases that the vast majority of users won't encounter. Specifying in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; API that any arbitrary send() invocation could throw some kind of &quot;retry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exception&quot; or return some kind of error code is really really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cumbersome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that we aren't talking about a particularly common case.
