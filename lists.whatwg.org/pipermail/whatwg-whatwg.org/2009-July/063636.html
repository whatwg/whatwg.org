<PRE>&gt;<i> &lt;The point&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I do not doubt of Ian's good faith, nor of his huge effort in making
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 the best possible thing it might be. However, I doubt of the
</I>&gt;<i> sanity of having an individual to have the final say about any topic,
</I>
I don't doubt the sanity of it at all.

&gt;<i> even above expert groups that have been researched and discussed the
</I>&gt;<i> topic for years.
</I>
That's that happen when no one has a final say: years of discussions.
Quite often&#8212;about the color of the bike shed.

&gt;<i> Just because the fruit of so long work can't be properly sintetized in
</I>&gt;<i> plain-text e-mails doesn't mean that there is not enough value on it.
</I>&gt;<i> Going back to the example, there was a lot of people involved in RDF
</I>&gt;<i> and RDFa since 1997. That's already twelve years of continuous work
</I>&gt;<i> and research by several people. HTML5 replaces all this effort (RDF
</I>&gt;<i> and RDFa) with that of a single person over few months (Microdata).
</I>
I doubt that discussions started in 1997 with HTML5 in mind. So I
guess those interested can keep going for 12 more years if so
inclined.


&gt;<i> Honestly, I can't say for sure which method would be best for HTML;
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm still convinced that having a single gatekeeper with absolute
</I>&gt;<i> power over the next web standard is, at least, insane.
</I>
I'd say that's the one the best ways to get something practical done.
To quote Frederick P. Brooks Jr.:
&quot;Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed
from one mind, or from a very small number of agreeing resonant
minds&quot;
