</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In practice, if the author wants to make the parenthetical text smaller,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he will. The question is whether we should encourage such small text to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marked up in a way distinguishable from other stylistic &lt;span&gt;s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, making legal text clearly readable should be a goal. However,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is too much a HTML5 goal: afaik, in most countries
</I>&gt;<i> there are general laws that define which kind of text can hold legal
</I>&gt;<i> value on different kinds of media, dealing with details such as
</I>&gt;<i> minimum size and color contrasts for each media, maximum speed for
</I>&gt;<i> running text (like bottom-screen text on TV ads), and so on. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, these will vary from country to country and/or region to
</I>&gt;<i> region; but IMHO general law is the area where legal text should be
</I>&gt;<i> handled with. Authors hence should find advice about the actual
</I>&gt;<i> requirements for legal text to be legally binding (ie: asking their
</I>&gt;<i> lawyers for advice), and honor such restrictions when putting a
</I>&gt;<i> webpage together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is pointless to make specific encouragements or discouragements on
</I>&gt;<i> how to include legal text on an HTML5 document: a good advice may
</I>&gt;<i> backfire if it leads a good-intended author to do something that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't match local laws on that regard; and evil-intended users will
</I>&gt;<i> ignore any advice from the spec and just push as much as they can to
</I>&gt;<i> the edge, looking for the most &quot;hard-to-read-but-still-legal&quot; possible
</I>&gt;<i> form.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basic task of HTML (the language itself, not the spec defining it)
</I>&gt;<i> is to provide authors with tools to build their documents and pages in
</I>&gt;<i> an interoperable way. HTML5 does well that job in the area of small
</I>&gt;<i> print, providing the &lt;small&gt; element to mark it up. That's exactly
</I>&gt;<i> enough, and IMHO there is no point on trying to go further.
</I>
The spec now has no encouragements at all. This is all it says:

# The small element represents small print or other side comments.

It then has two non-normative comments:

# Small print is typically legalese describing disclaimers, caveats, legal 
# restrictions, or copyrights. Small print is also sometimes used for 
# attribution.
#
# The small element does not &quot;de-emphasize&quot; or lower the importance of 
# text emphasized by the em element or marked as important with the strong 
# element.

This is about as neutral as I can make it while still keeping it useful.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not sure if the word &quot;legalese&quot; was intended to refer to all kinds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of legal text, or just the &quot;suspicios or useless&quot; ones. In any case, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; more accurate wording would help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This wording is vague intentionally, because it is a vague observation. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't know how we could make it more accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If vagueness is intentional, just take thing explicitly vague, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than a term that some may just take as &quot;vague&quot; but others may take as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;catch-all&quot; and others seem to even find offensive/despective.
</I>
I really don't understand this objection.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; First, leave the formal description &quot;The small element represents 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; small print or other side comments.&quot; as is: IMHO it is accurate and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; simple, and that's quite enough to ask from a spec.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Next, replace the note that reads &quot;Small print is typically legalese 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; describing disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Small print is also sometimes used for attribution.&quot; with something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like this: &quot;Small print is often used for *some* forms of legal text 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and for attribution. [...]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This makes clear that HTML (technically) allows using &lt;small&gt; to put 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; legal text (or anything else) in small print, but it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; encourage any specific usage of small print.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not convinced the suggested text is any better than the current 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text, to be honest. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...] The key on the sentence &quot;Small print is often used for *some* 
</I>&gt;<i> forms of legal text and for attribution.&quot; is the emphasis on &quot;some&quot;: 
</I>&gt;<i> this should be enough for any reader to understand that, if only some 
</I>&gt;<i> forms go on small print, other forms just don't. The &quot;some&quot; achieves 
</I>&gt;<i> your intended vagueness, and the emphasis makes such vagueness explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> enough. The current wording &quot;small print is typically used for 
</I>&gt;<i> legalesse&quot; is not just vague, but as ambiguous as the term &quot;legalesse&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> itself: a significant proportion of authors might miss-understand it and 
</I>&gt;<i> assume that any form of legal text is legalesse, so it can be on small 
</I>&gt;<i> print, but it isn't require to be so (because of the &quot;typically&quot;). 
</I>&gt;<i> Addressing this potential missunderstanding is the exact intent of my 
</I>&gt;<i> proposed text.
</I>
I really am finding it very difficult to have any concern over this 
particular text, but in the interests of moving on, I've changed the text 
so it doesn't say &quot;legalese&quot;.
