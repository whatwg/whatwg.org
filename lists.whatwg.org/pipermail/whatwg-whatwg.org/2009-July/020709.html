This isn't really done on enough sites to warrant built-in support, I 
don't think.


&gt;<i> 2. In search-boxes Javascript often is used for send every written

This was possible in a previous incarnation of HTML5, but we removed 
support because it wasn't an especially popular feature, and it turns out 
to have some pretty subtle complications.
