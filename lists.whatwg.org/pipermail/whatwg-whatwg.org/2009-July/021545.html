Not sure what other motivations there may be, but one shouldn't
underestimate the value of keeping a page running. It's one of the major
differences between desktop and web apps.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> feeds, for me, *if I just leave it open on my desktop.* It works great.
</I>

Exactly - but you have to leave it open on your desktop. I can't tell you
how many meetings I've missed because I've inadvertently closed (or crashed
:<i>) my browser, and forgotten to start up my web calendar when I restart.
</I>What I'd like, as a user, is some way to pin selected apps to run in the
background - whether that's something I initiate through the UI myself, or
via a prompt from the application is really a matter of UX.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Notifications: I don't think I've ever had Outlook notify me of new mail
</I>&gt;<i> when it's not running. It usually starts up with Windows, and it runs in the
</I>&gt;<i> background. If you turn it off from the tray, it stops.
</I>

The way I've envisioned any of these &quot;persistent running workers/pages&quot;
operating is the browser would have a status bar icon which would allow
background apps to display status, and also give the user the opportunity to
exit the browser or (possibly) close down individual apps. So it's a very
similar situation.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If browsers could tear off tabs, minimize them to tray and allow them to
</I>&gt;<i> send pop-up notifications, I think it would solve your main problem. Chrome
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be halfway there, with the &quot;Create Application Shortcuts...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> option, but I believe only Chrome and Firefox support tear-away tabs. This
</I>&gt;<i> sounds largely like a browser issue. If Chrome does it first, I'm sure the
</I>&gt;<i> others will see and follow along.
</I>

Agreed. I like this way of looking at the issue - framed in this manner, it
highlights this as primarily a UX challenge (&quot;how to present the idea of
'pinned' tabs to the user&quot;).
