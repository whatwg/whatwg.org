<PRE>
Based on the feedback below, I've removed the BibTeX vocabulary from 
HTML5. The primary use case -- enabling drag-and-drop in a manner that the 
target document could automatically add a reference to the source document 
-- can still be done between cooperating sources, it's just no longer a 
first-class citizen in the automatically generated drag-and-drop JSON 
object. (The previous mechanism found relevant citation information in the 
page or section footer and automatically included that.)

I would encourage people interested in enabling this use case to develop a 
format for this to expose in the drag-and-drop API, along with some 
scripts to enable it. This doesn't really require built-in support so long 
as scripting is enabled; the APIs do provide the power to do this already.

</I>&gt;<i> What does this mean? When would it become clear? BibTeX's deficits have 
</I>&gt;<i> been clear for ages. About everyone who works in humanities knows that

</I>&gt;<i> The two biggest problems in bibtex are two properties:

</I>&gt;<i> They're a problem because they're both horribly concrete/narrow, and
</I>&gt;<i> (arguably) redundant.

</I>&gt;<i> 1) publication-title
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... or, better yet ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) a nested/related object (call it &quot;publication&quot; or &quot;container&quot; or &quot;isPartOf&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... then extension becomes easier. If I need to encode a newspaper
</I>&gt;<i> article, then I just do:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> title = Some Article
</I>&gt;<i> publication-title = Some Newspaper
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> .. or (better, because I can attach other information to the container):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> title = Some Article
</I>&gt;<i> publication = [ title = Some Newspaper ]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As is, you need to add stuff like this just to resolve the problems

</I>&gt;<i> court-reporter-title
</I>&gt;<i> television-program-title
</I>&gt;<i> radio-program-title

</I>&gt;<i> Aside: of course, some of the above could be collapsed into more
</I>&gt;<i> generic stuff like &quot;broadcast-title&quot;, but I'm just following the same,

</I>&gt;<i> This stuff isn't theoretical Ian. Just look through this wikipedia

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp</A>&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;encode information related to the document proper. There seems little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;justification in having two different ways to represent a document
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;depending on whether on it is THIS document or THAT document.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand this point. Could you provide an example of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conflict?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an academic article in an open access biology journal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000082">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000082</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> THIS article refers to the metadata about the document proper, with
</I>&gt;<i> the title &quot;Accelerated Adaptive Evolution on a Newly Formed X
</I>&gt;<i> Chromosome.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The metadata about the documents referenced in text are included in
</I>&gt;<i> the bibliography. This is what I mean by THAT document.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point&#226;&#128;&#148;and this is an important one&#226;&#128;&#148;is that one should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> use to the same mechanism to describe both, but still to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish them. I'd think this journal would insist on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | 5. Aspects of BibTeX's core model are ambiguous/confusing. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;what number does &quot;number&quot; refer to? Is it a document number, or an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;issue number?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's the difference? Why does it matter?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't find the example, but I've come across cases where one needed
</I>&gt;<i> both an issue and document number. Since I haven't cited it, though, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess you can leave it aside ;-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | My suggestion instead?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | 1. reuse Dublin Core and vCard for the generic data: titles,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;creators/contributors, publisher, dates, part/version relations, etc.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;and only add those properties (volume, issue, pages, editors, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;that they omit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems unduly heavy duty (especially the use of vCard for author
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; names) when all that is needed is brief bibliographic entries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On what basis do you make this claim? &quot;[A]ll that is needed&quot; for whom?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll point out here that the article I link to above includes
</I>&gt;<i> affiliation information for the authors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this isn't the most critical point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | 2. typing should NOT be handled a bibtex-type property, but the same way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;everything else is typed in the microdata proposal: a global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;identifier
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) consistency; why introduce a new mechanism (from the standpoint of
</I>&gt;<i> microdata)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b) flexibility (since I've made clear that bibtex is not adequate, and
</I>&gt;<i> I have no intention relying on the WHATWG to determine what's
</I>&gt;<i> important)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | 3. make it possible for people to interweave other, richer, vocabularies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;such as bibo within such item descriptions. In other words, extension
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;properties should be URIs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is already possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, possible; but hardly very easy. See above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | 4. define the mapping to RDF of such an &quot;item&quot; description; can we say,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;for example, that it constitutes a dct:references link from the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now lets say that some kind of process to extend the bibtex vocabulary

</I>&gt;<i> is the prefix issue. But I have a really hard time seeing how prefixes 
</I>&gt;<i> is so onerous a burden as to justify the costs (to the WHATWG, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> metadata producers and consumers) of creating and maintaining a new 
</I>&gt;<i> spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, some possibly relevant background from the OpenDocument 
</I>&gt;<i> experience:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To make a long story short, ODF 1.2 will have an extensible metadata 
</I>&gt;<i> system based on RDF/XML (for in--package metadata) and a subset of 
</I>&gt;<i> RDFa.(for embedded). Getting to this solution was a long and torturous 
</I>&gt;<i> process, and the original proposal effectively forked RDFa by requiring 
</I>&gt;<i> fully unqualified URIs for names. The technical reasons were 
</I>&gt;<i> more-or-less the same as those that drove Ian to invent an entirely new 
</I>&gt;<i> spec: that in a GUI environment where users are copy-and-pasting 
</I>&gt;<i> content, dealing with prefixes was an additional burden on implementers. 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, people don't hand author ODF files, so prefix have no 
</I>&gt;<i> authoring benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, though, I understand the ODF TC decided to include prefixes, 
</I>&gt;<i> since implementers found the burdens largely theoretical (OpenOffice 
</I>&gt;<i> should see an initial implementation in 3.2 I understand), and because 
</I>&gt;<i> in general the group prefers to stick as closely to existing specs as 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On predefined vocabularies, we thought about doing something similar 
</I>&gt;<i> informally, but decided it was out-of-scope; better initially to put a 
</I>&gt;<i> solid extensible system in place and let developers start working with 
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My work on the Bibliographic Ontology was in part done with that in 
</I>&gt;<i> mind, though has the added benefit it can be repurposed for RDFa in 
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML.
