Agree.

To add to that, think about JavaScript and CSS support, and new
features introduced by HTML5:
 - Safari has &lt;canvas&gt; for some time now, but only Safari 4 has
tabindex=&quot;&quot; turning elements into &quot;focusable&quot; items (leading JS
libraries to hack around this with hidden form elements &#8211;as only those
are in &quot;tab order&quot; by default&#8211;); Safari also innovates in the CSS
field although it isn't yet perfect re. CSS 2 support (no browser is
perfect, and Safari has amongst the best CSS support). It does support
(some draft version of) WebDatabase and geolocation APIs yet not
&lt;video&gt;.
 - Firefox/Mozilla is a leading actor in the JS field and supports E4X
as well as not-yet-standardized JS features (&quot;for each&quot; loop,
generators and iterators, destructuring assignment, array
comprehensions, &quot;let&quot;, etc.), yet it too has incomplete (though mostly
complete) support for CSS 2.1.
 - Opera is/was the first to support (part of) Web Forms 2.0 (now
merged into HTML5)
As for CSS, many browsers started to support some CSS 2 and now CSS 3
selectors without having complete support for CSS 1 and CSS 2
properties or even syntax (e.g. the &quot;double class selector bug&quot; in
Internet Explorer)

&gt;<i> If you want to check that your pages are compatible with certain

</I>&gt;<i> approximation - you'd want a tool that understands what features IE10
</I>&gt;<i> supports (maybe some (but not all) from HTML4, some (but not all) from
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5, some proprietary extensions, etc), and it would be misleading
</I>&gt;<i> to think that a pure HTML-version-N validator is going to be good
</I>&gt;<i> enough for that.
</I>
I'd add that some HTML editors have switched to this kind of
&quot;selectors&quot; too (a while ago, you turned &quot;netscape navigator&quot; support
off and &lt;layer&gt; started to be flagged as errors, same for &lt;blink&gt; for
Internet Explorer, and same thing for JavaScript: document.all vs.
document.layers vs. document.getElementById, elt.attachEvent vs.
elt.addEventListener, etc.)

For example, Microsoft Expression Web 2 has an &quot;IE6&quot; mode in
IntelliSense CSS settings:
