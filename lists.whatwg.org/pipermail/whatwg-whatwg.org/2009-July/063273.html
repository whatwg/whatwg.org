&lt;video&gt; supports fallback to content that almost certainly has a very  
different API, in browsers that don't support &lt;video&gt; at all. I'm not  
sure why it would require major changes in the design to do such  
fallback in browsers that support &lt;video&gt;, but not the requested  
codec. It's true that it may be necessary to have multiple paths in  
your script if you use &lt;video&gt; that way. But you have to do that  
anyway, if you want to support browsers that don't have &lt;video&gt; at  
all. And in the case where you just want to embed a video using the  
best mechanism available, without scripting, the current design makes  
things harder. I think this argument holds up even if there is an  
agreed baseline - not everyone may want to use it, especially as the  
state of the art in video compression improves and higher resolution  
videos become more popular.

I don't think this is an urgent issue, because we probably still have  
time to change. But I think the spec took the wrong path here and your  
argument above is not very persuasive.

Maciej
