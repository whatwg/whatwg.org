The point is that there is no decided roadmap.

</I>
As you say, it's a free market. If people want Theora chips, then it's 
likely that they will become available. For that to happen there has to be 
some demand for Theora support, though, which the spec's can't generate.


&gt;<i> Definitively not as important as the above, I also have some

</I>&gt;<i> you really expecting agreements from ALL the players? Or just the big

</I>&gt;<i> you?
</I>
I'm talking primarily about the browser vendors who take part in this 
mailing list's discussions and have stated an opinion, regardless of size.


&gt;<i> Finally, it looks like Dirac looks worth discussing. I hope that their 
</I>&gt;<i> proponents do not drop the ball.
</I>
Agreed.
