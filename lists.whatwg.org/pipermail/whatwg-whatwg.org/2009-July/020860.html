</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's similar oddness with receiving events that satisfy the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to avoid introducing four different event types for the four

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) The 'readyState' attribute can never actually be used by an
</I>&gt;<i> application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and is redundant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Initially, the 'readyState' attribute is set to CONNECTING, but while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the object is in this state the user is not permitted to interact with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the WebSocket in any way.  The only useful thing that a user could do is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set event handlers and wait for the 'open' event to fire.  When the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WebSocket becomes connected, the readyState becomes 1 and the 'open'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event is fired. Once the WebSocket is open, the spec states that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whenever the connection is closed the readyState changes to CLOSED and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'close' event is enqueued. However, users can't usefully check the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; readyState to see if the WebSocket is still open because there are not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and cannot be any synchronization guarantees about when the WebSocket
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may close.  A user will have to wrap all calls to postMessage() (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; send() if the function is renamed) in a try/catch block in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handle INVALID_STATE_ERRs.  Once the 'close' event has been received the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; readyState attribute is useless since the state of the WebSocket is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; known and can never change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think 'readyState' should just go away since an application will have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to keep track of state updates through the fired events and use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; try/catch blocks around all API calls anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but the &quot;closed&quot; state of a given WebSocket doesn't have to exactly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; match the state of the underlying TCP connection, in the same way that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document.cookies doesn't exactly match the current set of cookies that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the network stack may be tracking (they can differ when HTTP responses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are received in the background while JS is executing).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if the remote server closes the TCP connection, it generates a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;close&quot; event which marks the WebSocket as closed. It means that you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could have a situation where you post messages to a WebSocket which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't received by the server because the connection is closed, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that's true regardless due to the asynchronous nature of the networking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've changed the spec to not throw an exception on send() if the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One thing about postMessage that I'm curious about. Since it has to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; report failure synchronously by throwing an INVALID_STATE_ERR, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to imply that all data must be written to a socket before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returning and cannot be asynchronously delivered to an I/O thread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without adding some risk of silently dropping messages. Seems like the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right choice would be to allow outbound messages to drop, which would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mean that developers would be forced to do their own handshaking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> send() doesn't report I/O errors, it only throws an exception if the
</I>&gt;<i> connection isn't open yet (and previously, if the connection had died
</I>&gt;<i> prior to it being called, though that is no longer the case), or if the
</I>&gt;<i> input is invalid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm also not sure there is good coverage of error conditions in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec. The only methods of error notification are exceptions in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; postMessage and onclose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, only onclose actually reports an error; the exception from send()
</I>&gt;<i> now only reports a misuse of the API, not a network error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had assumed that a WebSocket that fails to connect would invoke
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; onclose asynchronously, but I didn't see that in the spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's there, though subtle. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The constructor in the API spec invokes the &quot;Establish a Web Socket

</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;fail the Web Socket connection&quot; algorithm upon failure, and that
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm says to invoke the &quot;close the Web Socket connection&quot; algorithm,
</I>&gt;<i> and that algorithm says that this means that &quot;Web Socket connection is
</I>&gt;<i> closed&quot;, and the API spec says &quot;When the Web Socket connection is closed,
</I>&gt;<i> the readyState attribute's value must be changed to CLOSED (2), and the
</I>&gt;<i> user agent must queue a task to fire a simple event called close at the
</I>&gt;<i> WebSocket object&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've added a note that says this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without that you don't even have the ability to know if a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; socket failed to establish a connection (short of readyState polling).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The spec also doesn't indicate that the readyState should transition to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CLOSED on connection failure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is part of the same sequence of events as described above.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; postMessage() may want another exception condition... 'too much data

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mutate the readyState until JavaScript stops running then it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either have to either enqueue a second task to change readyState at some

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'close' event.  The latter would be much nicer to implement - but then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it does make the readyState completely useless as it would always be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WebSocket.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've left it as is (the attribute changes on the fly), which is possibly

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a better way to do error handling is to have an asynchronous

Sounds like that would require a protocol change. Is the message framing
spec'd in such a way that a new 'packet type' can be introduced in a
backward compatible fashion?
