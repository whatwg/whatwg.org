What risk?

Nothing is stopping you from doing that.


&gt;<i> It seems to me that you need to either take away this veto power you've 
</I>&gt;<i> given browser vendors, or you need to draw a line between the vendors 
</I>&gt;<i> that do have veto power and the ones that don't.
</I>
I haven't given browser vendors this veto power, they have it regardless. 
If implementors don't implement the spec, then the spec is fiction. 
There's nothing I can do about that.


&gt;<i> If you have already drawn such a line, I would like to know exactly 
</I>&gt;<i> where it is and what criteria were used to determine which vendors to 
</I>&gt;<i> allow and which ones to disallow.
</I>
In practice, a browser vendor has to have an installed base of a percent 
or so overall before they can really affect the direction of the Web.

This isn't a decision I have made myself. It's just how the world is.
