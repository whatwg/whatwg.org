Actually there has never been a roadmap on this issue.


&gt;<i> My point is that thinking that the free market will solve the issue by

</I>&gt;<i> assuming that Apple will implement Theora just because it is part of the

</I>
Apple has said they won't implement Theora regardless of whether it's in 
the spec or not. I agree though that it might be that the two outcomes I 
describe are also unlikely.


&gt;<i> Apple will not change their format even if the rest of the world uses 
</I>&gt;<i> any other thing. On the other side, the silent giant will not support 
</I>&gt;<i> anything other than their WMV and WMA format. Even if Apple and Mozilla 
</I>&gt;<i> reach an agreement, what will we do once Microsoft decides to speak up? 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I know the response.
</I>
I don't. I wish Microsoft would speak up, as that might help tilt the 
balance one way or the other.


&gt;<i> Having a preferred format tips the balance for the chipmakers to make a 
</I>&gt;<i> decision, and in the case of Theora, helps to stir discussion about the 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed hidden patents.
</I>
I agree entirely. It is sad that we can't find one.


&gt;<i> Theora might not be the best. But is the best that we have.
</I>
We don't even have Theora right now.
