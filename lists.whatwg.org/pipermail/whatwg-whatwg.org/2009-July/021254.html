I agree it's no simpler; I'm saying it's more compatible with IE.

I don't really understand what your proposal would actually translate to, 
in precise spec terms.

One alternative would be to make the scripts that have &quot;src&quot; attributes 
but are deferred be excluded from the innerHTML behaviour, and just have 
them do the old behaviour (which, in imprecise terms, is &quot;blowing away the 
document&quot;, and in more precise terms, is to execute once the parser has 
passed the EOF point, with the insertion point undefined, such that 
document.write() implies a document.open()). This might work; I didn't see 
any of the bugs be regarding &lt;script&gt; elements with src=&quot;&quot; attributes. But 
it's less compatible with IE than I usually try to be (I would have 
specced this innerHTML behaviour long ago if I'd thought to test for it).
