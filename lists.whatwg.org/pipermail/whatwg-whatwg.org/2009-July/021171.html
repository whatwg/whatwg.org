Agreed. Plus there is time-aligned textual markup that is not just
subtitles, captions, lyrics and karaoke: much is being talked about
timed metadata these days, and clickable regions, as well as spatial
and temporal notes.

The lowest hanging fruit for such time-aligned text are, however,
indeed subtitles and captions.

</I>&gt;<i> are CSS, not HTML...
</I>
Would you mind providing an example that demonstrates the use of media
queries? I cannot currently imagine what that could look like and how
it could work. Feels free to use CSS in addition to any require HTML
(and javascript?). Since I cannot imagine what that would look like
and how it could work, I cannot start to understand it as an
alternative.

Thanks,
Silvia.
