Separate issue. I'm just addressing the persistence needs here.
Communication between tabs in the same domain is easier to solve, it doesn't
bring up any new security issues.

Also: would these pages be regenerated automatically when the browser
&gt;<i> is reopened?

Up to the browser, but sure, if you quit the app holding the background tabs
and then relaunch it, it's fine to reopen those tabs. It's just like the
session management that browsers already offer.
