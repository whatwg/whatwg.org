</I>While users will certainly have applications and os-level accessibility 
tools,
web designers may have their own unique methods of presenting feedback,
and I believe, given enough easy-access, innovative interfaces will come 
from it.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>There is no guarantee that a host system will have a MIDI synthesizer,
and MIDI itself can quite simply be implemented with a series of audio 
clips, a sound font.
Given a very constrained environment (think old cell phone ring tones), 
you can still
&quot;simulate it, with a beep&quot;, to provide some form of fall back.

</I>How do you detect that the client player is too slow with the current 
audio tag?
&gt;<i> Why can't you just get the premixed jingles from the server?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>You can get pre-mixed jingles from the server, but that may mean high 
bandwidth
in an otherwise resource constrained environment.
&gt;<i> Isn't the reading voice a CSS thing?  
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes. So?
&gt;<i> Isn't sound transformation hard enough to deserve a complete API?  I think

</I>&gt;<i> programmers who do not have the slightest idea of how to deal with it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sound transformation does not need a &quot;complete&quot; API, but there are
certainly a few common filters which would make things easier on 
end-developers.
Given any amount of support, you'll soon see programmers developing
their own libraries.
&gt;<i> Imagine a Canvas interface with PutPixel only.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I've imagined Canvas with putPixel (and setPixel) and that's enough to 
support
arbitrary drawing, and arbitrary image formats, and that's better than 
nothing.

Most programmers will be able to use a Javascript library, just as 
they've done in the past.

If you have particulars you'd like to see in an initial API, do share.

I could think of FFT/inverse FFT as a particular function which might 
make sense in an initial API,
as they're very particular functions, they're resource intensive, and 
they're in common use.
