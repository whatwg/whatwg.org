On changes to the underlying string (using .setAttribute) you always
have to reparse from scratch anyway, so doesn't seem like that matters
here?

</I>
At least in the gecko implementation it's significantly more complex
than not normalizing whitespace. The way that the implementation works
in gecko is:

When a class attribute is set, (during parsing or using setAttribute)
we parse the classlist into a list of tokens. We additionally keep
around the original string in order to preserve a correct DOM
(actually, as an optimization, we only do this if needed).

This token-list is then used during Selector matching and during
getElementsByClassName.

So far I would expect most implementations to match this.

It would be very nice if DOMTokenList could be implemented as simply
exposing this internal token list. With the recent change to not
remove duplicates reading operations like .length and .item(n) maps
directly to reading from this token list. All very nice.

However writing operations such as .add and .remove requires operating
on the string rather than the internal token-list. The current spec
requires .remove to duplicate the tokenization process (granted, a
pretty simple task) and modify the string while tokenizing. It would
be significantly simpler if you could just modify the token-list as
needed and then regenerate the string from the token-list.
