<PRE>I have put a new version of the CRDF document up [1]. Here is a
summary of the most significant changes:

* Location: with the migration from &quot;Google Pages&quot; to &quot;Google Sites&quot;,
the PDF document will not be allowed anymore to be hosted at its
former location. I wanted to keep this proposal independent from my
own website; but in the need of a reliable location for the document,
I have made room for it on my site's host.
To avoid having to keep track of two online copies of the document nor
having an outdated version online, I have removed the document from
the old location.
My apologies for any inconvenience this might cause.

* Inline content: now full &quot;sheets&quot; are accepted inside the inline
crdf attribute, whatever it gets called; so something like &lt;div
crdf='@namespace foo &quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/foo#">http://example.com/foo#</A>&quot; '&gt;&lt;/div&gt; should be
doable, mimicking RDFa's in XML-based language ability to declare
namespaces inline with code like &lt;div
xmlns:foo=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/foo#">http://example.com/foo#</A>&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. In addition, a
pseudo-algorythm has been defined that allows to determine whether the
content of the attribute is a full sheet or just a set of
declarations.

* Inline vs. linked metadata: this brief new section attempts to
explain when each approach is more suitable, and why both need to be
supported by CRDF.

* Conformance requirements: this new section describes what a document
must do to be &quot;conformant&quot;, and what would tools have to do to be
&quot;conformant&quot;. It should be taken as an informative summary rather than
as a normative definition (especially the part about tools), and is
mostly intended to give a glance of what should be expected from an
hypothetical &quot;CRDF-aware browser&quot;.

* Microformats compatibility: after some research and lots of &quot;trial
and error&quot;, it has been found that it is not possible to match the
microformat concept of &quot;singular properties&quot; with CSS3 Selectors. The
document now suggest an extension (just a pseudo-class named
&quot;:singular&quot;) to handle this. This is a very new addition and feedback
on it would be highly valuable.
