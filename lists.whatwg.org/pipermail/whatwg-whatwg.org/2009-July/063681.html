The lesson I would learn from open source is that finding people  
willing to do useful work is much more important than tools or project  
organization. While good projects strive to refine their process, my  
experience is that people who start out by asking project-wide tools  
or process changes to enable their contribution rarely turn into  
valuable contributors. On the other hand, people who start out by  
making substantive contributions within the existing process often  
have excellent insights into how to improve the process and tools from  
there. That's not to say this is universal - just what my experience  
has been in ~14 years of open source development on various projects.

Regards,
Maciej
