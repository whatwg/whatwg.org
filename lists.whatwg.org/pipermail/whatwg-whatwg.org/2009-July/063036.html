I don't think putting it through SMPTE will magically create hardware
support. VC-1 and VC-2 didn't magically get hardware support through
being standardised by SMPTE. It is a combination of standardisation
and uptake that will get the confidence for the market. I think the
W3C is in a much better position to achieve this right now than the
SMPTE. Which standards body adopts it doesn't make much of a
difference to the market.

Don't get me wrong though: I don't have anything against putting
Theora through SMPTE - if SMPTE would indeed accept such a submission.
I could imagine SMPTE be interested in it for digital TV type
transmissions, e.g. for picture-in-picture in combination with VC-1 or
VC-2. But the SMPTE process will take a minimum of 2 years and a
dedicated person to travel to meetings, prepare the extensive
paperwork required, and lobby the SMPTE members - an expense that Xiph
is simply not in a position to fund. Also, the documentation required
for a standard is already available: a open specification, an open
reference implementation, test data, and a validation approach. So, it
would be a rather expensive experiment just to get political support
from the TV folks.

The only thing that SMPTE would probably add is a call for patent
holders to come forward now. This is something that the W3C can do,
too. If widely enough publicized, it should bring the risk down.

Please note that this is my personal opinion and not Xiph's official stance.

Regards,
Silvia.
