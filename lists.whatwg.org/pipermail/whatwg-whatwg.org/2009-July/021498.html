</I>+1 seperating the &quot;load-at-startup&quot; and
&quot;persist-beyond-connected-page-close&quot; from the more generally applicable
feature to &quot;connect to a directly scritable shared context from multiple
pages&quot;. Minus the lifetime questions, I don't think there's anything
terribly controversial about this... very similar to an invisible iframe
that's must be from the same-origin as the referencing page. I think this
could be a very valuable feature in general.

Gmail does really want permissions to run in the background... but I think
that could be layered on top of the more primitive &quot;shared context&quot; feature.

* one way to 'extend' things could be to allow a persistent worker (which
has permissions to run in the background) to load a shared context and hold
a refernce to it to prevent the shared context from closing (note: the
persistent worker wouldn't be able to directly script that shared context,
just bootstrap it and keep it alive).

* another way to extend things could be to allow an appcache manifest to
indicate which resources should be loaded into a shared context
