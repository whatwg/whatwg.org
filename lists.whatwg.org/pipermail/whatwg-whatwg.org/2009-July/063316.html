I think fallback contents is simply defined as the contents of the
&lt;video&gt;, minus any &lt;source&gt; elements (which wouldn't render anyway).
No need for &lt;new-fallback-element&gt;.

The simplest solution would be to display the fallback when there
aren't any &lt;source&gt; (or @src) elements being either displayed or
waiting to load. I think spec-wise the simplest thing would be to
display fallback when

The networkState of the element is NETWORK_NO_SOURCE.

This way even incremental rendering of the fallback contents would
work fine. The only case that's weird is markup like:

&lt;video&gt;
  lots and lots of fallback here
  &lt;source src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

There is a risk that content would be displayed, and then switch to
displaying video. This doesn't seem like a big problem as it seems
more likely that people will put the &lt;source&gt; first. And if someone
doesn't the effects aren't very bad.

Alternatively we could use the following rules:
1. The networkState of the element is NETWORK_NO_SOURCE.
*and*
2. The &lt;video&gt; element is fully parsed. I.e. it has been removed from
the stack of open elements.

This would mean that incremental rendering doesn't work. This doesn't
seem any worse than what we have now when fallback is never displayed.

Though I think it'd work fine always display fallback whenever the
networkState is NETWORK_NO_SOURCE.
