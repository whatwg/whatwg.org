True, but that feels like a hack. If the HTTP protocol contains the  
data you need, then a server-side script may try to provide the data  
and may possibly provide an incorrect value. Likewise at the very  
least its a duplication of data being sent.  This is certainly better  
then the current method, but not optimal.

I originally helped someone in an IRC channel with this question.  He  
wanted to check a &quot;Date&quot; header being sent from his server, via  
Javascript.  I don't know what his exact reason was.  We provided him  
the same solutions mentioned here.

However,  like Adam de Boor suggested, a use case could be detecting  
proxies.  The use case that I thought of was using custom headers to  
ensure requests go to a certain server in a cluster, perhaps to  
maintain a session with a reasonable cache.  But that isn't really  
compelling and probably not very common.
