Shouldn't a per-user setting be the sanest approach for the worker
limit? For example, it would quite make sense for me to want a low
limit (let's say 10 or so) workers on my laptop's browser; but have no
restriction (or a much higher one, like some thousand workers) on my
workstation.
Ian's point is key here: what's an appropriate limit for workers
depends almost entirely on hardware resources (and probably also on
implementation efficiency and other secondary aspects), and there is a
*huge* variety of hardware configurations that act as web clients, so
it's just impossible to hardcode a limit in the spec that works
properly for more than a minority. At most, I would suggest a note
like this in the spec &quot;User agents SHOULD provide the user a way to
limit the ammount of workers running at a time.&quot;: emphasis on the
&quot;SHOULD&quot; rather than a &quot;MUST&quot;, and also on the fact that the final
choice is for users to make. Then it'd be up to each implementor to
decide on default, out-of-the-box limits for their browser (it would
make sense, for example, if Chromium had a lower default limit than
FF, since C's workers are more &quot;expensive&quot;).

Just my two cents.

Eduard Pascual
