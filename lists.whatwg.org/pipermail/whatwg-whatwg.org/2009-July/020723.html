</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Going forward, I see several (not mutually exclusive) possibilities, all

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;1. Ogg Theora encoders continue to improve. Off-the-shelf hardware Ogg
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;Theora decoder chips become available. Google ships support for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;codec for long enough without getting sued that Apple's concern
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;regarding submarine patents is reduced. =&gt; Theora becomes the de facto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; &#160;codec for the Web.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This to me is a defeat of the standardisation process. Standards are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not there to wait for the market to come up with a de-facto standard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They are there to provide confidence to the larger market about making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a choice - no certainty of course, but just that much more confidence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it matters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually HTML5 is largely built on the idea of speccing the de-facto
</I>&gt;<i> standards, either long after they were implemented, or in tandem with them
</I>&gt;<i> being implemented. Very little of HTML5 has been ahead of implementations.
</I>
What about Internet Explorer, the browser with the largest market
share? Bascially all of HTML5 is ahead of being implemented in IE. I
don't think that argument holds.


&gt;<i> No; my only argument against Theora is that Apple won't implement it.
</I>
What about XiphQT? It doesn't matter that Apple doesn't natively
support Theora - the software exists to provide the support.
Therefore, the argument that &quot;Apple doesn't support Theora&quot; doesn't
hold up. It's not Apple that matters, but their browser. Safari and
Webkit have Theora support. There is an implementation.

In fact, I have not heard Apple object violently to an inclusion of
Theora into the specification as baseline codec. I have only heard
them object to a native implementation in Safari for submarine patent
threat reasons.


&gt;&gt;<i> Including a Theora prescription and having it only partially supported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with at least give a large part of the world an interoperable platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and that's all HTML has traditionally been.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same argument could be made for H.264.
</I>
Except that H.264 does not qualify any of the royalty-free
requirements that W3C has for standardising technology.


&gt;&gt;<i> You've said a couple of things that I perceive as contradictory, here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You've said that you want to help bring about interoperability, but then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you've also said that you're only documenting what it is that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser makers are implementing. &#160;There is room in the standards bodies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world for both goals, and both goals, at times are valid and beneficial.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, if your intent is to help bring about interoperability, *real*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interoperability, then I think its pretty clear that the way forward
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involves specifying a baseline codec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way forward involves getting to the point where we can specify a
</I>&gt;<i> baseline codec, yes. But we do that _after_ everyone agrees on a baseline
</I>&gt;<i> codec. While it may appear that I write stuff in the spec and the browser
</I>&gt;<i> vendors then agree to it, in practice it's usually the other way around.
</I>
That I can understand. But in this case, you should leave the
paragraph in the spec that states the need for a baseline codec, since
the situation hasn't changed and we are still striving for a baseline
codec.

Silvia.
