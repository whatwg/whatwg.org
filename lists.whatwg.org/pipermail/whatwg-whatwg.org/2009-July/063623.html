Hmm... Maybe a position:fixed text field somewhere on the page, with a 
submit button to send that feedback as mail... that could work. It could 
give the ID of the most recently clicked area of the page, or something.

Unfortunately that would just mean that most people commenting on beta 1 
would be reporting the same issues that have already been fixed. We've 
already seen this happen with the W3C version of the draft -- each time we 
release a /TR/ page snapshot, people report the same issues with that 
version for months, despite them having been fixed sometimes before the 
W3C version has even made it through the publication pipeline.
