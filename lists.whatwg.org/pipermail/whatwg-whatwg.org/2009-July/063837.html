I disagree. The proposal plays to the strenths of the web platform.

HTML parsing, layout, and rendering is very optimized, much more so than
programmatic HTML DOM manipulation. The incorporation of stateful script
contexts within each page considerably slows page loading. As navigations
occur, that statefullness has to be reconstructed from scratch. In addition
to creating and populating a new script context with the &lt;script&gt; itself,
this often involves reconstructing data the script operates on. So
additional server roundtrips and desrializing into js objects. With the
introduction of local storeage and databases, augment the server roundtrips
with the reading of those local repositories and deserializing into js
structures.

The sharedContext / backgroundPage provides a means to cut out completely
the need to reconstruct that JS world on each page navigation.

I really like the proposal... its elegant... (and more generally applicable,
and easier to use than fully asyn workers).

&lt;hyperbole&gt;
I think 5 years from now, people will be wondering why it was ever done
otherwise.
&lt;/hyberbole&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> solutions.
