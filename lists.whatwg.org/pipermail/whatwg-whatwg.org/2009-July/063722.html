Such as .length changing by more than 1 after a call to .toggle().

Fair enough. I've made DOMTokenList not remove duplicates.

It ends up being not much simpler since you still have to deal with direct 
changes to the underlying string, as far as I can tell.

In general, I try to be as conservative as possible in making changes to 
the DOM. Are the algorithms really as complicated as you're making out? 
They seem pretty trivial to me.
