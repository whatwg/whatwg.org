The only concern I see with this is that it permanently forces all
windows from the same domain to run in the same process. As things
stand today, if the user opens two tabs (or windows) and navigates to
the two different pages on www.example.com, then a browser could if it
so wished use separate processes to run those two pages. If we enabled
this API the two pages would have to run in the same process, even if
neither page actually used this new API.
