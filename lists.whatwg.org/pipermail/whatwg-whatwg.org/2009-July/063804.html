We try...  Note that given the extension model you don't have to put a 
binary blob in the extension either, since extensions can make HTTP 
requests and write to files.

&gt;<i> Do you think the existing FF install dialog gives enough warning that an
</I>&gt;<i> extension could outlive the browser process?
</I>
The dialog says &quot;Install add-ons only from authors whom you trust. 
Malicious software can damage your computer or violate your privacy&quot;.

I'm not a human-computer interaction expert, so I can't tell you how 
scary that is to the typical consumer.  Probably no more so than any 
other dialog he sees.  :(

&gt;&gt;<i> Really, it sounds like you want something more akin to a Prism app [1] than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything else.  You don't _actually_ want to run gmail in a browser window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  You just want to deliver it over <A HREF="http://">http://</A> and leverage a browser-like thing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the other end for rendering it, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'd like to not have to maintain two Gmail codebases, one for
</I>&gt;<i> installed usage and one for everyone else. Ideally the same code can
</I>&gt;<i> be used in an internet cafe and on the machine of someone who agrees
</I>&gt;<i> to install Gmail as an app. Prism might be similar to what we'd like.
</I>
Right; the whole point of Prism is that it needs no changes to the web 
app, last I checked, while at the same time allowing it to have its own 
process, window (possibly without the url bar and such, which makes a 
lot less sense for a window dedicated to a particular web app), and 
lifetime independent of the browser.
