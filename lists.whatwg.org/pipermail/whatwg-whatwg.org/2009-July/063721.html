</I>&gt;<i> 2) For multi-process browsers like Chrome, there seem to be limitations as
</I>&gt;<i> to what can actually be accessed between processes (direct DOM access across
</I>&gt;<i> process boundaries seems problematic for example). Do you have ideas about
</I>&gt;<i> how to address this, since assumedly the page calling getInstalledApp()
</I>&gt;<i> could be running under some arbitrary process?
</I>

Even with single-process browsers you would have to handle threading issues
in a way that is just not done in all browsers yet.

For a) - Having some way to load large amounts of cached javascript quickly
&gt;<i> in a new page seems like an issue that would be nice to address in general,
</I>&gt;<i> not just for pages that install hidden pages. Are there other approaches
</I>&gt;<i> worth trying here?
</I>

Loading of cached JavaScript isn't really that slow. I think the real issue
here is client state. It's often a good idea to have a copy of running
scripts in each process for stability anyway. However, cached
parsing/pre-compilation (if available) of scripts might be a generally good
idea. Perhaps some kind of process cloning like *nix forks?

IMHO, this could be solved cleaner and more memory efficient way with some
form of persistent workers rather than a &quot;hidden&quot; page. But I might be
missing something.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I had a quick question/clarification about the motivation behind this -
</I>&gt;<i> aside from the advantages described above, it sounds like the specific
</I>&gt;<i> problem you are solving by a hidden page is a) you don't have to load
</I>&gt;<i> javascript in a new page (which I'm assuming must be slow), and b) you don't
</I>&gt;<i> have to load client state in the new page.

</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be a huge source of slowdown.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the programming model of the hidden page is much cleaner/more

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello folks -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm an engineer on the Gmail team. We've been working on a prototype
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the Chrome team to make the Gmail experience better. We thought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we'd throw out our ideas to the list to get some feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> THE PROBLEM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would like to enable rich internet applications to achieve feature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parity with desktop applications. I will use Gmail and Outlook as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples for stating the problems we hope to solve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- Slow startup: When a user navigates to mail.google.com, multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server requests are required to render the page. The Javascript is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cacheable, but personal data (e.g. the list of emails to show) is not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> New releases of Gmail that require JS downloads are even slower to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- Native apps like Outlook can (and do) run background processes on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user's machine to make sure that data is always up-to-date.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- Notifications: Likewise, Outlook can notify users (via a background
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process) when new mail comes in even if it's not running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A SOLUTION
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our proposed solution has two parts. The first, which should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally useful, is the ability to have a hidden HTML/JS page running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the background that can access the DOM of visible windows. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page should be accessible from windows that the user navigates to. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call this background Javascript window a &quot;shared context&quot; or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;background page&quot;. This will enable multiple instances of a web app
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. tearoff windows in Gmail) to cleanly access the same user state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no matter which windows are open.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Additionally, we'd like this background page to continue to run after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user has navigated away from the site, and preferably after the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user has closed the browser. This will enable us to keep client-side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data up-to-date on the user's machine. It will also enable us to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download JS in advance. When the user navigates to a web app, all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background page has to do is draw the DOM in the visible window. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should significantly speed up app startup. Additionally, when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something happens that requires notification, the background page can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> launch a visible page with a notification (or use other rich APIs for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> showing notifications).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WHY NOT SHARED WORKERS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shared workers and persistent workers are designed to solve similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems, but don't meet our needs. The key difference between what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we're proposing and earlier proposals for persistent workers is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background pages would be able to launch visible windows and have full
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DOM access.  This is different from the model of workers where all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction with the DOM has to be done through asynchronous message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passing. We would like background pages to be able to drive UI in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visible window using the techniques (DOM manipulation, innerHTML) that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are common today. We believe that more apps would be able to take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantage of a background page if they didn't require rewriting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> app in the asynchronous, message-passing style required by workers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Allowing the background page to drive the UI by doing direct DOM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manipulation is a more common programming style. For apps that don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need the benefits of multiple threads provided by shared workers, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will give the benefits of fast startup and the benefits of running in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the background (like showing notifications) without the downside of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the worker programming model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The concepts here are similar to permanent workers, but with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different programming model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMPLEMENTATION AVENUES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For now, we have a simple API in Chrome. This is meant as a prototype
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the concepts, not as a final API.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- installApp(uri, name) Fetches the HTML page at uri, and runs it as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a hidden window. Currently this window is loaded when the machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> starts. This should eventually involve permissioning UI, but this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not implemented. name is a name that can be used to get access to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hidden window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- getInstalledApp(name) Returns a reference to the background page,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or null if the app is not installed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- removeInstalledApp(name) The moral equivalent of window.close() for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a background page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We might migrate to a model where webapps can be installed as Chrome
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extensions instead of using a Javascript call to install the app.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another alternative we've discussed is allowing authors to specify in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their AppCache manifest that a given page should be an always-loaded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> background page. This seems like a natural fit since the AppCache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manifest is where authors describe the attributes of various parts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their app.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> KNOWN ISSUES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As mentioned in earlier discussions about persistent workers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permissioning UI is a major issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FEEDBACK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would like to know if others would find this functionality useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does anyone have an idea for a better API?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
