</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe we should consider solving this differently. Either we could

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ignore the majority use case in the standard, which is why I proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the &lt;text&gt; elements inside the &lt;video&gt; tag.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If browser vendors are willing to merge subtitles and video files when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> saving them, that would be great. Is this easy to do?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My suggestion was really about doing this server-side, which we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already implemented years ago in the Annodex project for Ogg
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Theora/Vorbis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, it is also possible to do this in the browser: in the case of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ogg, the browser just needs to have a multiplexing library installed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well as a means to encode the subtitle file (which I like to call a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;text codec&quot;). Since it's text, it's nowhere near as complex as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encoding audio or video and just consists of light-weight packaging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code. So, yes, it is totally possible to have the browsers create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> binary video file that has the subtitles encapsulated that were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previously only accessible as referenced text files behind a separate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> URL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only issue I see is the baseline codec issue: every browser that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wants to support multiple media formats has to implement this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiplexing and text encoding for every media encapsulation format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differently, which is annoying and increases complexity. It's however
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally a small amount of complexity compared to the complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created by having to support multiple codecs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree, remuxing files would be much more of an implementation burden
</I>&gt;<i> than supporting multiple codecs, at least if a format-agnostic media
</I>&gt;<i> framework is used (be that internal or external to the browser). Remuxing
</I>&gt;<i> would require you to support/create parts of the media framework that you
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise aren't using, i.e. parsers, muxers, file writers and plugging of
</I>&gt;<i> these together (which unlike decoding isn't automatic in any framework I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen).
</I>
The point that I was trying to make is that if one had to only
implement it for one encapsulation format, it would be simple and a
small piece of dedicated code. However, if one has to be
format-agnostic, it indeed requires supporting parts of a media
framework that is not needed for demuxing and decoding. So, yes, I
agree with you: in the general case it might create extraneous
complexity in a browser.


&gt;<i> Anything is doable of course, but I think this is really something that is
</I>&gt;<i> best done server-side using specialized tools.
</I>
I agree with this. This can be a special service that some servers
would offer who want to allow their users to share single video files
that contain their timed text within.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would be interesting to hear back from the browser vendors about how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> easily the subtitles could be kept with the video in a way that survives
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reuse in other contexts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that in the case of external subtitles the browser could simply save
</I>&gt;<i> it alongside with the video. It is my experience that is media players have
</I>&gt;<i> much more robust support for external subtitles (like SRT) than for internal
</I>&gt;<i> subtitles, so this is my preferred option (plus it's easier).
</I>
Agreed: this would be the fallback for content downloaded from servers
that do no offer the special muxing capability.

In fact, such a separate handling of composed content through multiple
files is nothing new to HTML: all Web pages that I download from the
Internet require me to download each component of the Web page
separately: the images, the text, the css, the javascript. (Worse even
if the text is created e.g. through a database query.) I agree with
Philip that the separate handling of subtitle files and media files is
not as much of an issue as it may seem.

Regards,
Silvia.
