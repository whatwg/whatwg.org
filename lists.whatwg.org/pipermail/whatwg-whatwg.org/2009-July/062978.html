I don't think this should be a requirement.

As written, this requirement primarily means &quot;need to be able to build
devices today that play back with minimal power consumption&quot;. Obviously this
is desirable, but why is it *necessary* for a baseline codec? Why would a
vendor refuse to support a format because of high power consumption? It
seems to me that using up power can't be worse than refusing to play the
content at all. Does Apple block iPhone apps because they max out the CPU
while they're running?

It seems to me that this requirement forces HTML5 to merely document the
codec preferences of device vendors. I think HTML5 could be proactive
without being obnoxious, by recommending that Theora be supported wherever
possible. That would encourage the consumption and production of Theora
content, which would increase pressure on device vendors to support it well,
which would increase the chances us all getting a codec with good universal
support.
