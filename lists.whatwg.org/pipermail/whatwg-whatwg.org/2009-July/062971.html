I don't disagree with you on any of that, really.  I said you (Google, 
and others) have made a choice, corporately, on how open and transparent 
to be.  Certainly Google is less secretive than many other corporations 
as a whole, and seemingly the Chrome team is considerably more open than 
most of the rest of Google, even.

Nonetheless, as a whole, Google is a corporation and they have made a 
business decision to remain secretive on at least certain things.  I do 
think that's a reasonable decision to make, and I might very well make 
the same decision in your shoes.  My point was only to say that part and 
parcel of that decision is actions that tend to lead to criticisms of 
the company as a whole that Mozilla gets less of because they are more 
open.  I won't exactly hold Mozilla up as a paragon of openness and 
transparency, but they are better than Google, just as Google is better 
than MS, and I would even argue that MS is better than Apple.

I understand that you have said what you can say, and that's fantastic, 
and truthfully, I don't really expect more.  That doesn't, however, mean 
that I'm going to cease criticisms of the stated positions


As to the comparison between the Chrome and Youtube groups.  I wish that 
the Youtube portion of the company were more engaged here as they 
clearly are a relevant party to the discussion.  Again, I understand 
that as a business decision they may choose not to, but my understanding 
of that doesn't mean I'm not going to criticize them on it.
