The main use case is ordering. If you have ten variants, you might want to 
try the &quot;probably&quot;s before the &quot;maybe&quot;s, especially if there are a lot of 
weird codecs involved, such that the &quot;maybe&quot;s might be able to play 
somewhat, just not as well as the &quot;probably&quot;s.

What would &quot;canPlayType(&quot;video/ogg; codecs=vorbis&quot;)&quot; return? There's not 
enough information there to say whether or not you can play a stream 
labeled that way.


&gt;<i> Unless there's some compelling use case that can't be handled with the 
</I>&gt;<i> above I'd support canPlayType returning a boolean. The only issue I can 
</I>&gt;<i> see is that canPlayType(foo)==true might be interpreted as a strong

</I>&gt;<i> the function to wouldTryTypeInResourceSelection (no, not really).
</I>
You can use the method as it is now as a boolean method, in practice. 
However, I think there is value in being explicit that a &quot;true&quot; return 
value isn't really necessarily confident.

I'm with Robert on this. The idea is that you can take the actual MIME 
type of a file, and find out what the odds are that the file will play ok. 
In practice, the odds are lower with &quot;video/ogg&quot; than a type that 
explicitly lists a supported codec.

That certainly is unfortunate.

Ok.
