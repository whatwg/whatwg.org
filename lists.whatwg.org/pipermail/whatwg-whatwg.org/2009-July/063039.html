Specs can't create author demand for features that authors don't actually
want, but if authors want a general feature (say, simple CSS animations)
then having an implementation of that feature creates demand for that
particular incarnation of the feature, and giving it the CSS WG imprimatur
increases demand further.

Some authors want a royalty-free video codec. We have an implementation,
Theora. I believe linking HTML5 to it would increase author demand for it to
be supported in all browsers, and help those authors make a stronger case.
If I didn't think so, I wouldn't be wasting my time here.
