Not without a user prompt, currently.

Let's start with just frame busting, and then add the ability to open 
popups once we have more experience with frame busting.

I've added the keyword &quot;allow-top-navigation&quot; that allows pages to 
navigate their top-level browsing context.


&gt;<i> Some off-topic thoughts about this:

</I>&gt;<i> Most non-academic websites apply target=&quot;_blank&quot; on all external links. 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to allow a consistent user experience, it might be worth to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. &quot;Open new tabs rather than windows&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> This should not only apply to windows opened with target=&quot;_blank&quot; (as it 
</I>&gt;<i> is already possible e.g. in Firefox), but also to the ones opened by 
</I>&gt;<i> window.open().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. &quot;Always open links to other domains in a new tab&quot; (resp. window, if 
</I>&gt;<i> the above option is not set)
</I>&gt;<i> I would even encourage to set this as the default, as it is a de-facto 
</I>&gt;<i> standard at least in commercial and community websites.
</I>
This seems like something that would belong in a UA UI guide, rather than 
the HTML5 spec. The spec doesn't even mention tabs.
