</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When the img tag was made, all browsers initially supported BMPs, didn't

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GIF format made things hairy later, but with JPEG and PNG, the issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually resolved themselves. But the img tag was made at a time when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there was no format soup for images... Or at least, not one nearly as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serious a problem as the video tag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, image formats are less complicated to implement than video, both in
</I>&gt;<i> the codec itself and the fact that images don't have to worry about subtitles,
</I>&gt;<i> containers, seeking, sound, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Without a baseline codec, there is no guaranteed usefulness to the audio or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video tags. As for audio, I suggest supporting at least WAV (or FLAC) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vorbis at least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was the recommendation before all codec references where removed.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently among HTML5 browsers, I believe only Safari does not support Vorbis
</I>&gt;<i> (they all support pcm wav). Safari uses QuickTime, so if Apple would bundle
</I>&gt;<i> XiphQT, Safari would be set. Who knows what MS is planning for IE9, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think they would object too much to having Vorbis as an option,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if they
</I>&gt;<i> are using DirectShow. A great many high-profile games have used Vorbis,
</I>&gt;<i> including MS-published Halo and Fable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really, the audio situation seems fairly manageable. Vorbis even has an
</I>&gt;<i> advantage in size/quality over most other codecs, especially the so-common
</I>&gt;<i> MP3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For video, our best shot is either Dirac or Theora. Unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; somebody else has any other decent reasonably available open source,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; royalty-free codec that can be used for the video and audio tags?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if Google frees VP8...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was under the impression that Apple were one of the main opposers to using

</I>
For Theora. They haven't really said much about Vorbis AFAIK. And I think an
audio codec is less likely to have patent issues than a video codec (especially
since Vorbis has a lot of high profile use that should have drawn out any patent
trolls) , and that is what Apple supposedly is worried about.

&gt;<i> Also, when was the last time you ever knew Microsoft to go with standarised
</I>&gt;<i> formats when they can just as easily push one of their own?
</I>
&lt;shug&gt; MS isn't quite who they used to be. They open-source things, and put
things under the open specification promise, and they seem to be very serious
about CSS3 and (X)HTML5 standards now. I think there is at least a chance of
them supporting Vorbis.
