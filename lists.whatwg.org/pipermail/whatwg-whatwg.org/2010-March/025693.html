For what it's worth, I think Ben was asking for an exception to be thrown.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could throw an exception, but that would make migrating from this not

</I>
I don't see why it would be harder to add support for passing objects
later harder. I would say quite the opposite. People are more likely
to come to depend on objects down in an object graph being converted
to null, than they are to come to depend on that throwing an
exception.

Additionally, it's unlikely that converting to null is the fallback
behavior you want for downlevel clients. Likely you'd want to manually
serialize such objects and then parse them on the receiver side. In
this case too an exception would likely help you more than silently
converting to null.
