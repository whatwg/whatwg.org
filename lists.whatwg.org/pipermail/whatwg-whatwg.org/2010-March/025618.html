Passing functions doesn't really work, because as you say, you have to

It seems to me to be a very complicated and bug-prone idea for something 
that doesn't have concrete use cases. It might make sense to support it 
later if a clear need appears (which we determine by looking at the hacks 
that people use to work around the lack of support), but in the absence of 
such a need, I don't see much benefit to adding this.

Not yet, but we're mostly waiting for authoring experience before adding 
more features. It depends what people really need, but it's hard to 
determine that without a crowd of authors trying to use what we have.

I haven't changed this. Exception objects are somewhat magical in some 
languages and it seems unwise for the spec to try to clone that magic 
across thread or process boundaries. We could, however, define some 
simpler cloning mechanism that, for Error and DOMException objects, clones 
only specific fields, returning a simple Object with specific properties 
(in particular, 'message'). However, it's not clear to me what the use 
case is here. As others have noted, for debugging, the error information 
is already expected to be transmitted across without any help from the 
author -- and debugging tools are likely to be much more useful here than 
being able to send Errors easily.

We can't send &quot;true&quot; DOM objects across the divide, since implementations 
don't support DOMs in their worker implementations. I'm not really sure 
what else we should do. If we do something other than send null today, 
it's going to make it very difficult to later start cloning real DOM 
objects if we ever support that.

We could throw an exception, but that would make migrating from this not 
being supported to this being supported later a lot harder (you'd have to 
catch exceptions and then remove the nodes, rather than just doing null 
checks in the worker). I don't know that that's worth it.

Well an array mechanism could just be a generic &quot;port array&quot; that you can 
add and remove ports from dynamically, it need not be just for received 
ports. I haven't added this yet, but would appreciate more feedback from 
vendors on whether they think it's worth adding this now or waiting.
