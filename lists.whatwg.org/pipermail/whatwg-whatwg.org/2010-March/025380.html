A few comments:

1) WebKit has never had this rule. We have not had any significant  
problem reports based on it. Therefore I doubt there is truly a  
compatibility issue.

2) I do not believe the proposed rule is a good default for either  
documents or applications. It looks ugly. I randomly checked 10 of the  
sites I browse most often and I could not find a single one that  
explicitly added this rule for the browsers that don't have it. What's  
more, I could not find a single one that retained it for images. This  
rule is just a vestigial artifact that Web developers have to work  
around.

3) I expect the WebKit community would be against adding such a style  
rule, even if a spec said we should.

4) Even the 13-year-old HTML 3.2 spec has border=&quot;0&quot; on images used as  
links: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32</A>&gt;. That's before CSS!

5) I'd like to see some examples of actual 15-year-old Web pages that  
render better with this style rule than without, to the point that a  
modern reader would consider them broken.

Regards,
Maciej
