6 of the top 10 US web sites load scripts after the load event: eBay, 
Facebook, Bing, MSN.com, MySpace, and Yahoo.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got 3 questions, and 3 suggested clarifications to the spec. Thanks to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone who can explain these!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, my questions.  Are the following three statements correct?  (I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only concerned with&lt;script&gt;  tags that actually appear in a document,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not those inserted or emitted (via document.write()) by another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script.):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Scripts without async or defer attributes are executed in the order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in which they appear in the document.  They are executed synchronously,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which means that the parser must stop parsing the document while they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Mostly. There are ways to make things happen out of apparent order, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> using document.write() and appendChild(). I'd rather not try to explain
</I>&gt;<i> this in detail (in the spec, for authors) because it's likely to be wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> and it's likely to cause implementors to ignore the real spec and instead
</I>&gt;<i> read the author-facing description. We've already seen this happen
</I>&gt;<i> multiple times for the green DOM intro boxes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Scripts with the defer attribute, but without the async attribute are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executed in the order in which they appear in the document, but their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execution is deferred until the document has finished parsing. All these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts will execute before DOMContentLoaded and the load event are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fired.  A deferred script can assume that the entire DOM tree has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constructed and is ready for manipulation--these scripts do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally need to register an onload event handler. A call to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document.write() within a deferred script will blow away the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document and begin a new one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Scripts with the async attribute are executed as their script content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> becomes available over the network, with no guarantee that they will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executed in the order in which they appear in the document.  The only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guarantee is that these scripts will run before the DOMContentLoaded or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load events are fired. Document parsing may or may not have completed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when an async script is run, and a call to document.write() from an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> async script will have unpredictable behavior. Though the order of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execution of async scripts is not predictable, the scripts will always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appear to run in some serial order without concurrent execution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> I just changed the DOMContentLoaded event to fire before the async events.
</I>&gt;<i> Other than that it is correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Next, I suggest that the following things in the spec be clarified:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) After describing the async and defer attributes, the spec promises:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The exact processing details for these attributes are described below.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I take this to mean &quot;below, somewhere in section 4.3&quot;.  In fact,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, the exact processing details are scattered throughout the spec,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and understanding the attributes requires understanding section 9, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think. It would be nice to note this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) The last sentence of this paragraph:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The second is a flag indicating whether the element was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;parser-inserted&quot;. Initially, script elements must have this flag
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unset. It is set by the HTML parser and is used to handle
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> document.write() calls.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made me think that the &quot;parser-inserted&quot; flag would only be set to true
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for scripts that were emitted through document.write() calls.  That is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I thought that the parser-inserted flag would be set only in unusual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cases rather than in the most common case.  This section should explain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the meaning of the parser-inserted flag. Instead it describes one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purposes of the flag, but that purpose is different than the purpose for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which it is used in this section.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to make it less confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) The algorithm for &quot;running a script&quot; adds scripts to &quot;the list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts that will execute as soon as possible&quot;.  And 9.2.6 spins the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event loop until this list is empty.  But I don't see anything in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec that removes items from this list.  That seems like an error in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec, not just a confusing bit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Oops. Fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, the fact that this mechanism is specified as a &quot;list&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than as a &quot;set&quot; implies some kind of sequential execution of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts.  But I don't think any sequence is meant here.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. &quot;If neither attribute is present, then the script is fetched and executed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immediately, before the user agent continues parsing the page.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Thankfully, newer browsers are downloading scripts in parallel with other

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements, etc. - only kickoff HTTP requests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> The spec says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
</I>&gt;<i> # implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # For performance reasons, user agents may start fetching the script as

</I>&gt;<i> # be inserted into the document. Either way, once the element is inserted
</I>&gt;<i> # into the document, the load must have started. If the UA performs such
</I>&gt;<i> # prefetching, but the element is never inserted in the document, or the
</I>&gt;<i> # src attribute is dynamically changed, then the user agent will not
</I>&gt;<i> # execute the script, and the fetching process will have been effectively
</I>&gt;<i> # wasted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...which is intended to allow this. I suppose I could change the last
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph quoted above to allow downloads even before elements are
</I>&gt;<i> created, if you think that would be better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. &quot;If one or both of the defer and async attributes are specified, the src
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute must also be specified.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      It should be possible to specify DEFER without a SRC. The use case is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page that has a sequence of SCRIPTs (with and without a SRC attribute) all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which need to execute in order, but should do so without blocking the parser.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This happens a lot with ads, widgets, and analytics. A workaround is to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callbacks to daisy-chain the calling sequence, but the complexity will lead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most 3rd party snippet providers to default to a normal SCRIPT tag (without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DEFER or ASYNC) resulting in blocking the parser and slow pages. It's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially annoying for web site owners to have 3rd party content slowing down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their pages and blocking the content they've created.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      This appears to be a recent change perhaps prompted by Jonas Sicking's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comments that Mozilla found many web sites that specified DEFER without a SRC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then called document.write (which pretty clearly indicates the developer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't mean to specify DEFER). If that's the motivation for this restriction,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need to either find an alternative syntax or go ahead and allow DEFER
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without SRC. Finding an alternative is the worse alternative (DEFER has the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exact behavior we want, so creating something with a different name that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaves just like DEFER is confusing). If we do move forward with allowing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DEFER without SRC, then we need to specify what happens if it contains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document.write so that the entire document isn't overwritten. (I believe this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is addressed in section 3.5.) There's no good way to make DEFER do what it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should and have those pages who are using DEFER incorrectly work the way they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do now. With this path, at least those pages will have their content appear at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bottom and not wipe out the entire page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for the spec being the way it is is indeed as you describe
</I>&gt;<i> (well, IIRC it has more to do with innerHTML than document.write(), but
</I>&gt;<i> it's similar). However, the problem is non-trivial. Getting compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> with legacy content while supporting defer=&quot;&quot; on&lt;script&gt;  without src=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> appears to me to be hugely complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems pretty easy to work around this limitation by just having

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Am I right that HTML5 will standardize Opera's pure DOMContentLoaded

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break compatibility with the current Gecko and Webkit implementations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Scripts can block the whole parser until style sheets have loaded, which
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly means the script will wait too, but other than that, yes, the
</I>&gt;<i> spec doesn't wait for style sheets for DOMContentLoaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Does the HTML5 parser specify that external stylesheets defer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> external script execution? As far as I understand the specs, it doesn't.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> It does, unless I made a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In Gecko and IE, the loading of stylesheets also defers the execution of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequent *inline* scripts. I haven't found a rule for that in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML5 parsing algorithm either. Does it conform to the specs, is it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against the rules or a legitimate extension which is not covered by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML5?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> The spec does require that. Search for &quot;a style sheet blocking scripts&quot;.
