This is true -- getImageData/putImageData unfortunately saddled us with 
two performance-killing bits:

1) clamping on assignment.  Not so bad, but doesn't help.

2) Unpremultiplied alpha.  This is the biggest chunk.  We have more 
optimized code in nightly builds of Firefox now that uses a lookup table 
and gets a pretty significant speedup for this part of put/get, but it's 
not going to be as fast as drawImage.

Also, canvas is often (or can be) backed by actual hardware surfaces, 
and drawImage from one to another is going to be much faster than 
reading the data into system memory and then drawing from there back to 
the hardware surface.

If we wanted to support this across workers (and I think it would be 
helpful to figure out how to do so), something like saying that if a 
canvas object was passed (somehow) between workers, it would be a copy 
-- and internally it could be implemented using copy-on-write semantics.
