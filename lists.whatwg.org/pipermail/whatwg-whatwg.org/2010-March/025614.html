If we're exposing nothing from the protocol, does that mean we shouldn't 
be exposing that the string converts to UTF-8 either?

I guess I'm unclear on whether bufferedAmount should return:

1. the sum of the count of characters sent?
   (what would we do when we add binary?)

2. the sum of bytes after conversion to UTF-8?

3. the sum of bytes yet to be sent on the wire?

I'm not sure how to pick a solution here. It sounds like WebKit people 
want 3, and Opera and Mozilla are asking for 2. Is that right? I guess 
I'll go with 2 unless more people have opinions.
