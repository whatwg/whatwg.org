<PRE>Agree 100% (even with geolocation).

On Wed, 2010-03-10 at 07:54 -0800, Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) wrote:
&gt;<i> As I talk with more application developers (both within Google and at
</I>&gt;<i> large), one thing that consistently gets pointed out to me as a
</I>&gt;<i> problem is the notion of the opaqueness of storage quotas in all of
</I>&gt;<i> the new storage mechanisms (Local Storage, Web SQL Database, Web
</I>&gt;<i> Indexed Database, the Filesystem API being worked on in DAP, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> First, without being able to know how large your quota currently is
</I>&gt;<i> and how much headroom you are using, it is very difficult to plan in
</I>&gt;<i> an efficient manner. For instance, if you are trying to sync email, I
</I>&gt;<i> think it is reasonable to ask &quot;how much space do I have,&quot; as opposed
</I>&gt;<i> to just getting halfway through an update and finding out that you hit
</I>&gt;<i> your quota, rolling back the transaction, trying again with a smaller
</I>&gt;<i> subset, realizing you still hit your quota, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see a method added, for any &quot;storage mechanism&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> something like &quot;GetCurrentQuota()&quot; and &quot;GetCurrentQuotaUsed()&quot;. (I
</I>&gt;<i> specifically don't care what they're called or the details, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> whether they need to be callbacks, I just want to see us address this
</I>&gt;<i> use case.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, I think we need a better answer for obtaining a larger
</I>&gt;<i> quota. Let's think for a moment about the use cases -- in most
</I>&gt;<i> instances, I am going to make a decision that I want to use an
</I>&gt;<i> application offline. (I personally would not expect to browse to a
</I>&gt;<i> site and then just happen to be able to use it offline, nor do I
</I>&gt;<i> expect users to have that expectation or experience. Rather, I expect
</I>&gt;<i> going through some sort of flow like clicking something that says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Yes, I want to use Application X offline&quot;. At this point, I want to
</I>&gt;<i> get any permissioning issues out of the way. I don't want to wait
</I>&gt;<i> until the data sync to the Web XXX Database starts failing 10 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> later to pop up an infobar that is no longer in the user's current
</I>&gt;<i> flow / state of mind, I don't want to then pop up another infobar 30
</I>&gt;<i> minutes later saying their Filesystem quota is full, etc. I want to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to get this out of the way all at once, at a point in time where
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the user is actually in the mindset / task of deciding that
</I>&gt;<i> they want to use my web application. I specifically do not want to
</I>&gt;<i> have to deal with 4 different infobars, potentially at 4 different
</I>&gt;<i> points in time, to use an application I have decided I want to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To that point, I would like to see a method added (presumably that can
</I>&gt;<i> only be called in response to a user action) that would allow my page
</I>&gt;<i> to request a bundle of permissions. I am going to go out on a limb
</I>&gt;<i> here and include geolocation in this bundle. Some sort of a callback
</I>&gt;<i> type API where I pass in a list of permissions that I want, the UA is
</I>&gt;<i> free to display this to the user in whatever mechanism it determines
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate (if at all -- e.g. if the user has already denied
</I>&gt;<i> geolocation and that's being requested again, as a UA i might decide
</I>&gt;<i> not to present that request). That is, I could pass in something like
</I>&gt;<i> [&quot;LocalStorageQuota&quot;, 20*1024*1024 /* 20M */, &quot;WebSQLQuota&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> 1*1024*1024*1024 /* 1GB */, &quot;FileSystemQuota&quot;, 10*1024*1024*1024 /*
</I>&gt;<i> 10GB */, &quot;Geolocation&quot;, true], and the callback could then (as a
</I>&gt;<i> convenience) indicate the current quota for all of the things that I
</I>&gt;<i> asked for, so that I could figure out whether the user accepted,
</I>&gt;<i> denied, or accepted and modified the request and how I can then
</I>&gt;<i> proceed (or not proceed). Again, I don't care terribly about the
</I>&gt;<i> details of how the API looks, the above is just meant for
</I>&gt;<i> illustration.
