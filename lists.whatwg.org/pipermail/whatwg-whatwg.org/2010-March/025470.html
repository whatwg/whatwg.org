<PRE>2010/3/10 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> As I talk with more application developers (both within Google and at
</I>&gt;<i> large), one thing that consistently gets pointed out to me as a problem is
</I>&gt;<i> the notion of the opaqueness of storage quotas in all of the new storage
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms (Local Storage, Web SQL Database, Web Indexed Database, the
</I>&gt;<i> Filesystem API being worked on in DAP, etc). First, without being able to
</I>&gt;<i> know how large your quota currently is and how much headroom you are using,
</I>&gt;<i> it is very difficult to plan in an efficient manner. For instance, if you
</I>&gt;<i> are trying to sync email, I think it is reasonable to ask &quot;how much space do
</I>&gt;<i> I have,&quot; as opposed to just getting halfway through an update and finding
</I>&gt;<i> out that you hit your quota, rolling back the transaction, trying again with
</I>&gt;<i> a smaller subset, realizing you still hit your quota, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see a method added, for any &quot;storage mechanism&quot;, something
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;GetCurrentQuota()&quot; and &quot;GetCurrentQuotaUsed()&quot;. (I specifically don't
</I>&gt;<i> care what they're called or the details, e.g. whether they need to be
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks, I just want to see us address this use case.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I too have heard this plea over and over again.  I've also heard that even
knowing the order of magnitude of headway would be useful.  This is nearly a
deal breaker for a lot of apps.  Having to gracefully handle a quota related
error _every_ single time you do an operation is a big pain.


&gt;<i> Secondly, I think we need a better answer for obtaining a larger quota.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's think for a moment about the use cases -- in most instances, I am
</I>&gt;<i> going to make a decision that I want to use an application offline. (I
</I>&gt;<i> personally would not expect to browse to a site and then just happen to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use it offline, nor do I expect users to have that expectation or
</I>&gt;<i> experience. Rather, I expect going through some sort of flow like clicking
</I>&gt;<i> something that says &quot;Yes, I want to use Application X offline&quot;. At this
</I>&gt;<i> point, I want to get any permissioning issues out of the way. I don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to wait until the data sync to the Web XXX Database starts failing 10
</I>&gt;<i> minutes later to pop up an infobar that is no longer in the user's current
</I>&gt;<i> flow / state of mind, I don't want to then pop up another infobar 30 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> later saying their Filesystem quota is full, etc. I want to be able to get
</I>&gt;<i> this out of the way all at once, at a point in time where I believe the user
</I>&gt;<i> is actually in the mindset / task of deciding that they want to use my web
</I>&gt;<i> application. I specifically do not want to have to deal with 4 different
</I>&gt;<i> infobars, potentially at 4 different points in time, to use an application I
</I>&gt;<i> have decided I want to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To that point, I would like to see a method added (presumably that can only
</I>&gt;<i> be called in response to a user action) that would allow my page to request
</I>&gt;<i> a bundle of permissions. I am going to go out on a limb here and include
</I>&gt;<i> geolocation in this bundle. Some sort of a callback type API where I pass in
</I>&gt;<i> a list of permissions that I want, the UA is free to display this to the
</I>&gt;<i> user in whatever mechanism it determines appropriate (if at all -- e.g. if
</I>&gt;<i> the user has already denied geolocation and that's being requested again, as
</I>&gt;<i> a UA i might decide not to present that request). That is, I could pass in
</I>&gt;<i> something like [&quot;LocalStorageQuota&quot;, 20*1024*1024 /* 20M */, &quot;WebSQLQuota&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> 1*1024*1024*1024 /* 1GB */, &quot;FileSystemQuota&quot;, 10*1024*1024*1024 /* 10GB */,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Geolocation&quot;, true], and the callback could then (as a convenience)
</I>&gt;<i> indicate the current quota for all of the things that I asked for, so that I
</I>&gt;<i> could figure out whether the user accepted, denied, or accepted and modified
</I>&gt;<i> the request and how I can then proceed (or not proceed). Again, I don't care
</I>&gt;<i> terribly about the details of how the API looks, the above is just meant for
</I>&gt;<i> illustration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I wish you had put this in its own email.  These are really two very
different subjects.

That said, I agree with you...as long as we can do it in a manor that's
completely unobtrusive and not in the &quot;Do you want this app to work: yes or
no&quot; style (where yes implies giving them tons of permissions).  Ideally with
an &lt;input&gt; type.  Perhaps the input could have parameters that give the
&quot;recommended&quot; values and then leave the rest up to the UA to help advise the
user?
