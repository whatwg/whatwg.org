<PRE>Hello WHATWG,

Due to the proprietary nature of the H.264 codec and the expensive  
licensing fees that go along with it, I propose that the MPEGLA and  
the Licensors of the codec disclose the patents royalty free if the  
codec is included as a part of the HTML5 specification. I am aware  
that this is already a requirement of the W3C, but it seems the  
license has not been disclosed yet.

Another issue behind the H.264 codec is that it is owned by some of  
the worlds largest corporations. A list of the patent holders can be  
found here: <A HREF="http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Pages/Licensors.aspx">http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Pages/Licensors.aspx</A>

After reviewing the patents and licensing agreements, browser  
companies would be forced to pay large sums of money if they chose to  
implement it. Also, web service creators who wish to offer video  
encoding services would not be able to afford to pay for the license.  
Naturally, Apple and Microsoft, would have no problems using the  
codec in their browsers seeing as they are patent holders. This could  
give them an unfair advantage financially and technologically.

The purpose of the W3C specification is to create an open and free  
environment for the free advancement of web technologies. Proprietary  
technologies such as the H264 codec only add to the fragmentation of  
the browser and development industries. Isn't this the problem the  
W3C is trying to solve with its specification?

If these issues have already been raised, please point me to the  
correct forums for its discussion. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Aaron Franco
