</I>&gt;<i> The perfect solution would be a &lt;summary&gt; tag, if you look at the

</I>&gt;<i> done like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;&lt;summary&gt;This is just an example, it's a replacement for the old meta 
</I>&gt;<i> description, and is a brief summary (description) of the page 
</I>&gt;<i> (content)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way the first paragraph in a page would remain unchanged from how 
</I>&gt;<i> it is done today, and a search engine like Google or screen readers etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> would use the summary tag instead
</I>&gt;<i> of the meta description (which is no longer needed at all in cases like 
</I>&gt;<i> this), if more than one summary tag the first is considered the page 
</I>&gt;<i> summary one, while the others are ignored (but still shown as content 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a new tag is overkill for this, maybe doing it this way instead 
</I>&gt;<i> (using one of the new HTML5 tags):
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;&lt;header summary&gt;This is just an example, it's a replacement for the 
</I>&gt;<i> old meta description, and is a brief summary (description) of the page 
</I>&gt;<i> (content)&lt;/header&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really do not care how this is implemented/speced just as long as it's 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I began thinking of this recently when it annoyed me that I basically 
</I>&gt;<i> had to enter the same content twice, after looking at my site links in 
</I>&gt;<i> Google,
</I>&gt;<i> and thought to myself...Why do I have to use a meta description to tell 
</I>&gt;<i> Google to show the content in the first paragraph as the default summary 
</I>&gt;<i> of the page link?
</I>&gt;<i> Why can't I simply specify that the first paragraph &quot;is&quot; the page's meta 
</I>&gt;<i> description? Why am I forced to bloat the page unnecessarily like this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thee is no reason why the meta description can not be the actual content 
</I>&gt;<i> as in most cases I've seen the meta description is supposed to be fully 
</I>&gt;<i> human readable,
</I>&gt;<i> unlike the meta keywords which no search engines bothers with at all any 
</I>&gt;<i> more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if the meta description is supposed to be humanly readable and 
</I>&gt;<i> displayable as the page summary to humans in search results,
</I>&gt;<i> why can't it also actually &quot;be&quot; in the page content?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can see at least two ways this will be used. The more elegant way I 
</I>&gt;<i> showed, where the first paragraph is a summary/the lead in of the page 
</I>&gt;<i> (and also happens to be the &quot;teaser&quot; content in my RSS feed as well),
</I>&gt;<i> or at the bottom of a page with possibly linked category tags or similar 
</I>&gt;<i> within it, again allowing dual purpose and reduced redundancy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To re-iterate, the idea of the summary tag (or however it is 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented) should be to have a human readable summary (or teaser as 
</I>&gt;<i> may be) of a page, which is itself shown in the page,
</I>&gt;<i> but also a replacement for search engines that use the old meta 
</I>&gt;<i> description avoiding redundancy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> End result is (hopefully) less redundancy, and higher quality summary 
</I>&gt;<i> (page description) shown in search engine results, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> Also allowing people to quickly understand what a page is about by just 
</I>&gt;<i> reading the first paragraph (or be enticed to read more).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now if something like this allready exist/is possible I stand corrected 
</I>&gt;<i> and ask, please tell me how to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> If not then I'd love to see something like this standardized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW! The text in the first paragraph of this very email could for 
</I>&gt;<i> example be the summary/description of this email.
</I>&gt;<i> So if it was html tagged in some way, a mail indexing or search engine 
</I>&gt;<i> could use that as the summary or description view shown to a human user 
</I>&gt;<i> scrolling through archived emails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Roger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

The main problem with that would be that parsers would then need to read
into the &lt;body&gt; of the page to produce a description of your site. This
might not produce much of an overhead on a one-off basis, but imagine a
parser that is grabbing the description from hundreds or thousands of
pages, then this could become a bit of a problem.

Thanks,
Ash
