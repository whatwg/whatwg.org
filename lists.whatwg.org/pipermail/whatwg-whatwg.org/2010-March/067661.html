</I>
I don't think there are serious compatibility issues. We've been  
shipping this behavior in Safari since 2003. I searched all our bugs  
mentioning images or borders (including closed bugs) and could not  
find one mentioning this issue. Probably no one noticed because the  
vast majority of Websites had already been overriding this behavior  
for years.

&gt;<i> I apologize for the case this is a stupid suggestion: Could the spec  
</I>&gt;<i> say that the default for HTML5 is no border, but UAs are encouraged  
</I>&gt;<i> to render linked images in documents with pre-HTML5 or no doctypes  
</I>&gt;<i> with a border?
</I>

I don't think there is any evidence that this behavior is necessary or  
desirable for pre-HTML5 documents.

Regards,
Maciej
