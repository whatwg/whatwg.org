I think it is cleaner to have an asynchronous image load operation (as  
shown above) and then a synchronous image paint operation, rather than  
to introduce a asynchronous paint operation directly on the 2D context.

I don't think there is any sane way to add an asynchronous draw  
command to the 2D context, given that all the existing drawing  
commands are synchronous. What happens if you do an async paint of a  
File, followed by synchronous painting operations? It seems like the  
only options are to force synchronous I/O, give unpredictable results,  
or break the invariants on current drawing operations (i.e. the  
guarantee that they are complete by the time you return to the event  
loop and thus canvas updates are atomic)

Separating the async I/O from drawing allows the 2D context to remain  
100% synchronous and thus to have sane semantics.

I think the number of steps is not the primary concern here. The issue  
driving the proposal for offscreen canvas is responsiveness - i.e. not  
blocking the main thread for a long time. It seems to me that number  
of steps is not the main issue for responsiveness, but rather whether  
there are operations that take a lot of CPU and are done  
synchronously, and therefore, whether it is worthwhile to farm some of  
that work out to a Worker. I/O is not really a major consideration  
because we already have ways to do asynchronous I/O.

Regards,
Maciej
