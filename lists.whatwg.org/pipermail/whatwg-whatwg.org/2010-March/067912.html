</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is that correct, or are there any other use cases anyone had in mind?

</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't aware of (b). What's the case where you would want to know when a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a problem with defining this. I agree that if we include

</I>&gt;<i> define it, as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like the idea of bufferedAmount but it could almost be &quot;arbitrary

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as adding in any protocol overhead, there is no way an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application is going to know what that is unless you split the protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stack at some point. I don't see why the application level would want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know anything about the lower level protocol.  At the same time, if an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation wants to add in some of the overhead that it sees, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is still going to give the application all the tools it needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implement whatever it can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether it includes the overhead or not is mostly academic for authors, I
</I>&gt;<i> think. It's only relative numbers that actually matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would focus on words like &quot;monotonically decreasing&quot; after a send.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And &quot;eventually ends up at zero&quot;.  Those two things are what I'd like to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be sure are true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not clear to me how the current text would fail to match those

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from API point of view, why should bufferedAmount contain some bytes

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think viewing the API spec and the protocol spec as separate is a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the consensus is now leaning towards changing the spec again
</I>&gt;<i> to include the overhead,
</I>Well, what if the overhead isn't buffered? What if the implementation
just buffers the bytes from send(), and writes the websocket protocol 
specific bytes to the socket when needed?

And if bufferedAmount includes the overhead, it needs to be specified
what bufferedAmount is during handshake.

</I>&gt;<i> really matters, which makes this more of an opinion thing. I'd encourage
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else with an opinion on this to make their opinion known. (Yes, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> actually _asking_ for people to suggest colours for this bikeshed!)
