<PRE>2010/3/11 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I think apps will have to deal with hitting quota as you describe, however
</I>&gt;<i> with a normal desktop app you usually have a giant disk relative to what the
</I>&gt;<i> user actually needs. When we're talking about shipping something with a 5mb
</I>&gt;<i> or 50mb default quota, that's a very different story than my grandfather
</I>&gt;<i> having a 1tb disk that he is never going to use. Even with 50mb (which is
</I>&gt;<i> about as much freebie quota as I think I am comfortable giving at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment), you will blow through that quite quickly if you want to sync your
</I>&gt;<i> email.
</I>
How did you come up with 50MB?  As a user, I would want &quot;the
application that is gmail&quot; to have the same capabilities as &quot;the
application that is thunderbird&quot;, I think.  Isn't that our goal?

&gt;<i> The thing that makes this worse is that you will blow through it at
</I>&gt;<i> some random point (as there is no natural &quot;installation&quot; point from the APIs
</I>&gt;<i> we have.
</I>
That's the case for desktop applications too, really -- mostly I run
out of disk not when I install uTorrent or Thunderbird, but when I'm
trying the Nth linux distro to find one that likes my video card or
someone mails me an HD-resolution powerpoint and I'm about to head to
the airport.

&gt;<i> I would personally be in
</I>&gt;<i> favor of this approach, if only we had a good way to define what it meant to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;offline the app&quot;.
</I>
Sorry, I was working from that premise, which (I thought!) you stated
in your first message:

&quot;I personally would not expect to browse to a site and then just
happen to be able to use it offline, nor do I expect users to have
that expectation or experience. Rather, I expect going through some
sort of flow like clicking something that says &quot;Yes, I want to use
Application X offline&quot;.&quot;

Could also be an infobar on first some-kind-of-storage use, which
users can click to say &quot;yeah, make sure this works offline&quot; vs &quot;it can
use some storage, I guess, but don't let it get in the way of my
torrents!&quot;  I am not a UI designer worth the term, but I *do* believe
that the problem is solvable.

Mike
