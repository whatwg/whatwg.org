I did want to add the text apis but it does add implementation difficulties
for WebKit (and as I understand Firefox). However, they are part of what
people want and it does simplify the interfaces, so done.

Sounds good.

Apologies for not including this at the start. As now mentioned in several
places in the thread, the simplest use case is resize/rotate of images.

However, more complex use cases may involve heavy users of canvas who would
like to either prerender the canvas and/or move the time taken to generate
the canvas off of the main thread. While it is true that simple uses of
canvas would not get a performance win out of this, if you are doing many
canvas operations, (like many complex operations) it is faster to copy a
result than it is to generate it.

Ideally canvas will get some form of toBlob which will allow the image to be
appropriately compressed as well which will also reduce the number of bits
that need to be copied from the worker to the main thread (as well as make
for a smaller upload than the raw bits).

Lastly, in the future, one can see other uses for the OffscreenCanvas
including WebGL for workers which several folks (Maciej and Jonas) have
expressed interest about on this thread.
