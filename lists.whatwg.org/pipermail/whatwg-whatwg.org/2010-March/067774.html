</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think apps will have to deal with hitting quota as you describe,
</I>&gt;<i> however
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a normal desktop app you usually have a giant disk relative to what
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user actually needs. When we're talking about shipping something with a
</I>&gt;<i> 5mb
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or 50mb default quota, that's a very different story than my grandfather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having a 1tb disk that he is never going to use. Even with 50mb (which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about as much freebie quota as I think I am comfortable giving at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moment), you will blow through that quite quickly if you want to sync
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; email.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How did you come up with 50MB?  As a user, I would want &quot;the
</I>&gt;<i> application that is gmail&quot; to have the same capabilities as &quot;the
</I>&gt;<i> application that is thunderbird&quot;, I think.  Isn't that our goal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
AFAIK most browsers are setting a default quota for storage options that is
on the order of megabytes.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The thing that makes this worse is that you will blow through it at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some random point (as there is no natural &quot;installation&quot; point from the
</I>&gt;<i> APIs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the case for desktop applications too, really -- mostly I run
</I>&gt;<i> out of disk not when I install uTorrent or Thunderbird, but when I'm
</I>&gt;<i> trying the Nth linux distro to find one that likes my video card or
</I>&gt;<i> someone mails me an HD-resolution powerpoint and I'm about to head to
</I>&gt;<i> the airport.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would personally be in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; favor of this approach, if only we had a good way to define what it meant
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;offline the app&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I was working from that premise, which (I thought!) you stated
</I>&gt;<i> in your first message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I personally would not expect to browse to a site and then just
</I>&gt;<i> happen to be able to use it offline, nor do I expect users to have
</I>&gt;<i> that expectation or experience. Rather, I expect going through some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of flow like clicking something that says &quot;Yes, I want to use
</I>&gt;<i> Application X offline&quot;.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could also be an infobar on first some-kind-of-storage use, which
</I>&gt;<i> users can click to say &quot;yeah, make sure this works offline&quot; vs &quot;it can
</I>&gt;<i> use some storage, I guess, but don't let it get in the way of my
</I>&gt;<i> torrents!&quot;  I am not a UI designer worth the term, but I *do* believe
</I>&gt;<i> that the problem is solvable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, but I think there may be uses of things like storage for non-offline
uses (pre-fetching email attachments, saving an email that is in a draft
state etc.)  If it's relatively harmless, like 1mb usage, I don't want to
pop up an infobar, I just want to allow it. So, I don't really want to have
an infobar each time a site uses one of these features for the first time,
I'd like to allow innocuous use if possible. But at the same time, I want
apps to be able to say up front, at a time when the user is thinking about
it (because they just clicked something on the site, presumably) &quot;here's
what I am going to need&quot;.
