That is a conforming implementation of the first step of the printing 
steps (&quot;The user agent may display a message to the user and/or may abort 
these steps&quot;).


&gt;<i> Or should browsers which don't support window.print() just not have 
</I>&gt;<i> print() method in the window object? (problem is that I'd guess everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> just expects .print() to be there)
</I>
All browsers are required to have the method.

</I>
I've left window.print() as conforming, based on the above feedback.

</I>
What could a Web page do that a browser couldn't do better in the same 
situation? (The browser could offer a PDF, so having the site offer a PDF 
when there's no printer doesn't seem like a good solution.)

If all it's going to do is alert &quot;Printing is not supported&quot;, then the 
current spec text (which allows the UA to alert such) seems better, since 
then it only has to be implemented once per UA rather than once per site.

To do what?

Indeed.

</I>
Also a good point.


I haven't made any changes to the spec in response to the above, because 
it's not clear what change would benefit users. The spec already allows 
UAs to basically do whatever they want in response to window.print().
