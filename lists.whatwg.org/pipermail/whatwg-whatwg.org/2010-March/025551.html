I've changed the spec to fire 'DOMContentLoaded' without waiting for the 
async scripts, so that if you need this you can just listen for that event 
instead of 'load'. 'load' still waits for all scripts. 'DOMContentLoaded' 
still waits for deferred scripts. As far as I can tell this handles all 
the above (still makes sense, still consistent with the way other 'load' 
events work, but still lets you do things without waiting).

&quot;Browser-specific features&quot; should be featured-tested, not version-tested.

These strings could also be freely overridden in some browsers, so I don't

I'd rather not add yet more features to this particular object. We should 
discourage this kind of thing, not encourage it.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, my questions.  Are the following three statements correct?  (I'm

</I>&gt;<i> which means that the parser must stop parsing the document while they

</I>
Mostly. There are ways to make things happen out of apparent order, e.g. 
using document.write() and appendChild(). I'd rather not try to explain 
this in detail (in the spec, for authors) because it's likely to be wrong, 
and it's likely to cause implementors to ignore the real spec and instead 
read the author-facing description. We've already seen this happen 
multiple times for the green DOM intro boxes.


&gt;<i> 2) Scripts with the defer attribute, but without the async attribute are 
</I>&gt;<i> executed in the order in which they appear in the document, but their 
</I>&gt;<i> execution is deferred until the document has finished parsing. All these 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts will execute before DOMContentLoaded and the load event are 
</I>&gt;<i> fired.  A deferred script can assume that the entire DOM tree has been 
</I>&gt;<i> constructed and is ready for manipulation--these scripts do not 
</I>&gt;<i> generally need to register an onload event handler. A call to 
</I>&gt;<i> document.write() within a deferred script will blow away the current 
</I>&gt;<i> document and begin a new one.
</I>
Sounds right.


&gt;<i> 3) Scripts with the async attribute are executed as their script content 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes available over the network, with no guarantee that they will be 
</I>&gt;<i> executed in the order in which they appear in the document.  The only 
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee is that these scripts will run before the DOMContentLoaded or 
</I>&gt;<i> load events are fired. Document parsing may or may not have completed 
</I>&gt;<i> when an async script is run, and a call to document.write() from an 
</I>&gt;<i> async script will have unpredictable behavior. Though the order of 
</I>&gt;<i> execution of async scripts is not predictable, the scripts will always 
</I>&gt;<i> appear to run in some serial order without concurrent execution.
</I>
I just changed the DOMContentLoaded event to fire before the async events. 
Other than that it is correct.


&gt;<i> Next, I suggest that the following things in the spec be clarified:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) After describing the async and defer attributes, the spec promises: 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The exact processing details for these attributes are described below.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> I take this to mean &quot;below, somewhere in section 4.3&quot;.  In fact, 
</I>&gt;<i> however, the exact processing details are scattered throughout the spec, 
</I>&gt;<i> and understanding the attributes requires understanding section 9, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think. It would be nice to note this.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> 2) The last sentence of this paragraph:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The second is a flag indicating whether the element was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;parser-inserted&quot;. Initially, script elements must have this flag 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unset. It is set by the HTML parser and is used to handle 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document.write() calls.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> made me think that the &quot;parser-inserted&quot; flag would only be set to true 
</I>&gt;<i> for scripts that were emitted through document.write() calls.  That is, 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought that the parser-inserted flag would be set only in unusual 
</I>&gt;<i> cases rather than in the most common case.  This section should explain 
</I>&gt;<i> the meaning of the parser-inserted flag. Instead it describes one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> purposes of the flag, but that purpose is different than the purpose for 
</I>&gt;<i> which it is used in this section.
</I>
I've tried to make it less confusing.


&gt;<i> 3) The algorithm for &quot;running a script&quot; adds scripts to &quot;the list of 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts that will execute as soon as possible&quot;.  And 9.2.6 spins the 
</I>&gt;<i> event loop until this list is empty.  But I don't see anything in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec that removes items from this list.  That seems like an error in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec, not just a confusing bit.
</I>
Oops. Fixed.


&gt;<i> Furthermore, the fact that this mechanism is specified as a &quot;list&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than as a &quot;set&quot; implies some kind of sequential execution of the 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts.  But I don't think any sequence is meant here.
</I>
Fixed.

The spec says:

# Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be

# For performance reasons, user agents may start fetching the script as

# prefetching, but the element is never inserted in the document, or the 
# src attribute is dynamically changed, then the user agent will not 
# execute the script, and the fetching process will have been effectively 
# wasted.

...which is intended to allow this. I suppose I could change the last 
paragraph quoted above to allow downloads even before elements are 
created, if you think that would be better.


&gt;<i> 2. &quot;If one or both of the defer and async attributes are specified, the src
</I>&gt;<i> attribute must also be specified.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     It should be possible to specify DEFER without a SRC. The use case is a
</I>&gt;<i> page that has a sequence of SCRIPTs (with and without a SRC attribute) all of
</I>&gt;<i> which need to execute in order, but should do so without blocking the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> This happens a lot with ads, widgets, and analytics. A workaround is to use

</I>&gt;<i> especially annoying for web site owners to have 3rd party content slowing down
</I>&gt;<i> their pages and blocking the content they've created.
</I>&gt;<i>     This appears to be a recent change perhaps prompted by Jonas Sicking's
</I>&gt;<i> comments that Mozilla found many web sites that specified DEFER without a SRC
</I>&gt;<i> and then called document.write (which pretty clearly indicates the developer
</I>&gt;<i> didn't mean to specify DEFER). If that's the motivation for this restriction,
</I>&gt;<i> we need to either find an alternative syntax or go ahead and allow DEFER
</I>&gt;<i> without SRC. Finding an alternative is the worse alternative (DEFER has the
</I>&gt;<i> exact behavior we want, so creating something with a different name that
</I>&gt;<i> behaves just like DEFER is confusing). If we do move forward with allowing
</I>&gt;<i> DEFER without SRC, then we need to specify what happens if it contains
</I>&gt;<i> document.write so that the entire document isn't overwritten. (I believe this
</I>&gt;<i> is addressed in section 3.5.) There's no good way to make DEFER do what it
</I>&gt;<i> should and have those pages who are using DEFER incorrectly work the way they
</I>&gt;<i> do now. With this path, at least those pages will have their content appear at
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom and not wipe out the entire page.
</I>
The reason for the spec being the way it is is indeed as you describe 
(well, IIRC it has more to do with innerHTML than document.write(), but 
it's similar). However, the problem is non-trivial. Getting compatibility 
with legacy content while supporting defer=&quot;&quot; on &lt;script&gt; without src=&quot;&quot; 
appears to me to be hugely complicated.

It seems pretty easy to work around this limitation by just having 
callbacks in the code, though, so I don't really see this as a huge 
problem.


&gt;<i> 3. &quot;[the 'parser-inserted' state] is set by the HTML parser and is used to

I removed that comment. To answer your question, though, it's used to 
ensure that script run in the right order which affects the insertion 
point which affects the way document.write() works.


&gt;<i> 4. &quot;If the element has a src attribute, [snip] the specified resource must

Browsers can prioritise when scripts are loaded, but I think it would be a 
mistake to disallow browsers from fetching scripts earlier than load. (To 
start with I think they're ignore the requirement.)


&gt;<i> 5. I don't see any rules for the order of executing scripts added to the

The rules are implicit in how the lists (the list and the set, now) are

&quot;Must be fetched&quot; means it runs the &quot;Fetch&quot; algorithm, which explicitly

This idea is interesting, but I think it's better for us to wait until 
we've seen what browsers do with async=&quot;&quot; before adding yet another 
feature to &lt;script&gt;. If we add too much at once, browsers will have no 
hope of implementing it all correctly. :-)

Given that it is possible to do this from script, how common is it for 
people to do it from script? If it's very common, that would be a good 
data point encouraging us to do this sooner rather than later.

Scripts can block the whole parser until style sheets have loaded, which

Added. Let me know if you think anything else needs them. (I don't want to 
automatically add them to every paragraph because the resulting bloat is 
excessive.)

I've changed the comment near the definition of the term to be clearer. I 
hope that helps.
