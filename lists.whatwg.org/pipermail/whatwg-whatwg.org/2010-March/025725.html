</I>
I think fallback is to be considered an exceptional case. Especially
as time goes on and more browsers implement support for the new type.

&gt;&gt;<i> If null is sent you have to inside the worker send back an error message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the sender. The sender has to find the correct data to send, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be hard given that the error message is received asynchronously,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then resend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that if you need the data either way, that sending null is
</I>&gt;<i> useless. There are simple work-arounds for this (for example, sending one
</I>&gt;<i> DOM node in a test message and having the worker let you know if it worked
</I>&gt;<i> or not, so that you can construct the right class of object to handle the
</I>&gt;<i> communication: one that sends DOM nodes or one that constructs the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant data), but of course they are not ideal, just like using
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions everywhere isn't ideal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is, what are the actual concrete cases where people will be
</I>&gt;<i> sending DOM nodes? Without concrete cases, it's easy to construct
</I>&gt;<i> artificial cases that prove this to be better one way or the other.
</I>
Say sending a DOM that the user has edited (using contentEditable)
which the worker will convert into a ODF document and send to the
server.

&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, I guess it comes down to if we think it's more likely that people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will send Nodes and other unsupported objects by accident or as optional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data, or because they really want to send them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Personally my guess it's more likely that they really wanted to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea which is more likely. The only use case I'm aware of is
</I>&gt;<i> passing an &lt;img&gt; in, and for that there isn't really a fallback position,
</I>&gt;<i> so it doesn't matter if we send null or throw an exception.
</I>
It just seems unlikely to me that people send data without actually
needing to. If someone does postMessage(X), then I would think they
intend to use X on the other end, be that if X is a DOM Node object or
a JS Array.

&quot;they probably intended to say postMessage(Y)&quot; seems as likely as
&quot;they probably meant to appendChild(X)&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I think throwing an exception fits in with the spec's use of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them elsewhere (i.e., cross-document and web workers.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where do we use exceptions for extension points in a similar way?
</I>
For circular object graphs in the very same algorithms. So

var a = {};
a.x = a;
worker.postMessage(a);

throws an exception.
