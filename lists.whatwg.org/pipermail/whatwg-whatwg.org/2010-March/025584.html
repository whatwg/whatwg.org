<PRE>Hi,

I'm somewhat frustrated right now.  I hope this email is not too  
caustic.

The page at <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/</A> causes  
my Firefox to freeze for a minute or more.  Eventually it recovers and  
it has all the pretty do-dads and things but it sure is painful to  
wait.  And, this may be a Firefox problem but every time I hit a link,  
it freezes again as it recomputes (I guess) all the pretty do-dads and  
things.  The pretty do-dads and things just are not worth it to me.   
Maybe there is something I can turn off but not until after the first  
wait period.

Second, I downloaded the PDF (the html-letter.pdf) and various tools  
(like Acrobat reader) complain when I try to reflow the document.

Third, if I save the page above to my disk and open it with  
dreamweaver and try to make it in to an xhtml document, it dies.  The  
reason I'm trying to do that is some html to pdf converters insist  
upon xhtml format.

My ultimate goal (which I have now determined is hopeless) is to put  
these documents on my &quot;nook&quot; so I can read them.  Putting the html- 
letter pdf on my nook &quot;works&quot; but has many UI issues.  I thought if I  
could redo the formatting somehow it might be nicer.  Which leads to  
my final question or request.

Can the original source of this, whatever it is stored in, be posted  
as well?  There is a comment somewhere that says the W3 version and  
the whatwg version comes from the same source.  It might allow  
energetic folks to offer other formats of the books such as in epub  
format or some other eReader style format.

Thanks,
Perry

</PRE>
