The conclusion was that it is a presentational issue and therefore should 
be handled in one of the CSSOM specs. Unfortunately we don't have anyone 
who has the bandwidth to edit a spec to specify how to make things go 
full-screen. WebKit is experimenting with some APIs in this space, I 
believe.

</I>
Yes, currently synchronising accompanying slides and animations isn't 
supported. I expect in the relatively near future we'll add something to 
address this problem.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At 4 timeupdate events per second, it isn't all that useful. I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; replace it with setInterval, at whatever rate I want, query the time, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and get the synchronization I need, but that makes the timeupdate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; event seem to be redundant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The important thing with timeupdate is that it also fires whenever the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time changes in a significant way, e.g. immediately after a seek, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when reaching the end of the resource, etc. Also, the user agent can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start lowering the rate in the face of high CPU load, which makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more user-friendly than setInterval().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, it is important to be able to reduce the rate in the face of 
</I>&gt;<i> high CPU load, but as currently implemented in WebKit, if you use 
</I>&gt;<i> timeupdate to keep anything in sync with the video, it feels fairly

</I>&gt;<i> need to use setInterval, which defeats the purpose of making timeupdate 
</I>&gt;<i> more user friendly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this is just a bug I should file to WebKit, as they are choosing

</I>&gt;<i> reasonable default value (such as 30 times per second, or once per frame 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed) in the spec, to give some guidance to browser vendors about 
</I>&gt;<i> what authors will be expecting.
</I>
Well, as mentioned, it's really not intended for keeping things synced up.


&gt;<i> Most (if not all) video formats supported by &lt;video&gt; in the various 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers do not store alpha channel information. In order to composite 
</I>&gt;<i> video against a dynamic background, authors may copy video data to a 
</I>&gt;<i> canvas, then paint transparent to all pixels matching a given color.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This use case would clearly be better served by video formats that 
</I>&gt;<i> include alpha information, and implementations that support compositing 
</I>&gt;<i> video over other content, but given that we're having trouble finding 
</I>&gt;<i> any video format at all that the browsers can agree on, this seems to be 
</I>&gt;<i> a long way off, so stop-gap measures may be useful in the interim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Compositing video over dynamic content is actually an extremely 
</I>&gt;<i> important use case for rich, interactive multimedia, which I would like 
</I>&gt;<i> to encourage browser vendors to implement, but I'm not even sure where 
</I>&gt;<i> to start, given the situation on formats and codecs. I believe I've seen 
</I>&gt;<i> this discussed in Theora, but never went anywhere, and I don't have any 
</I>&gt;<i> idea how I'd even start getting involved in the MPEG standardization 
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>
If compositing is a use case we should address, we should address it 
explicitly, so that it is performant. We shouldn't have people copy each 
frame to a canvas, process it, then copy it back.

However, I don't think compositing video, as important as it is, is more 
important than some of the other missing features we have (such as 
subtitles), so let's wait a bit longer before adding it!

</I>&gt;<i> Let's say we declare the quality in the &lt;source&gt; elements in some form

</I>&gt;<i> source selection algorithm, since we are asking the UA to make a
</I>&gt;<i> choice of which media source to use based on the quality information.
</I>&gt;<i> The source selection algorithm goes through the list of &lt;source&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> elements from top to bottom and stops at the first one that it is able

</I>&gt;<i> better choice. Thus, we have to require from authors to build the list
</I>&gt;<i> in a way that the highest quality content is put at the top of the
</I>&gt;<i> list, while lower qualities are put further down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;source src='video-hd.ogv' media='quality:1.0' type='video/ogg;
</I>&gt;<i> codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;'&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;source src='video-hq.ogv' media='quality:0.5' type='video/ogg;

</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;source src='video-sd.ogv' type='video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;'&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/video&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, we need to devise an algorithm for UAs to determine which quality
</I>&gt;<i> to choose based on the given computer/device and connection. This is
</I>&gt;<i> not trivial, but let's assume we are able to do so and set
</I>&gt;<i> * quality:1.0 to any connection &gt;5Mbit, CPU &gt;  2GHz, and
</I>&gt;<i> * quality:0.5 to any connection &gt; 1Mbit, CPU &gt; 1.5GHz.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be measured once during source selection and thus the choice 
</I>&gt;<i> made. But it's actually not a guarantee that it will work. If your 
</I>&gt;<i> connection degrades or your CPU gets busy with other applications, the 
</I>&gt;<i> choice may need to be revised. YouTube doesn't currently allow for this, 
</I>&gt;<i> so this kind of solution would replicate what YouTube does at this point 
</I>&gt;<i> - which doesn't seem to be such a bad thing, since YouTube is acceptable 
</I>&gt;<i> for most people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An improvement over this would be the introduction of an adaptive stream 
</I>&gt;<i> scaling scheme over HTTP, similar to e.g. Microsoft's Smooth Streaming 
</I>&gt;<i> and Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (also note: Adobe is in the process of 
</I>&gt;<i> developing HTTP streaming support). There is no such thing available for 
</I>&gt;<i> Ogg yet, but the Ogg community is interested in developing/using 
</I>&gt;<i> something that is open and fulfills the needs for HTML5. It may well be 
</I>&gt;<i> that an activity should be taken up by the WHATWG (or W3C? or IETF?) to 
</I>&gt;<i> develop a media-format independent adaptive streaming standard over 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP. The point about adaptive streaming is that it does not require any 
</I>&gt;<i> new HTTP headers to deliver the data or any new software on the HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> server - the choice is made client-side by switching between different 
</I>&gt;<i> encodings of the same resource on the server. This requires declaration 
</I>&gt;<i> of the available alternative files to the client - which could either be 
</I>&gt;<i> done inside HTML5 or through some extra resource. Apple's scheme, for 
</I>&gt;<i> example, uses m3u-based files (m3u8), while MS's scheme uses SMIL-like 
</I>&gt;<i> files (ismv).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple's scheme is already going through the IETF for standardisation as 
</I>&gt;<i> an informal RFC, but not through a working group. Apple's scheme is 
</I>&gt;<i> based on massive creation of small chunks (e.g. 10s duration) on the 
</I>&gt;<i> server - an overhead that could possibly be avoided by using W3C Media 
</I>&gt;<i> Fragment URIs. There are lots of things to discuss for such an activity 
</I>&gt;<i> and the WHATWG may not be the best forum for discussing this - though in 
</I>&gt;<i> the end it's up to the browser vendors to implement it, so maybe it 
</I>&gt;<i> would.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that adaptive HTTP streaming deliberately avoids introducing new 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP parameters and server requirements, because these are really 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to roll out, in particular since they also create new 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements on HTTP proxy infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we develop such an adaptive streaming approach, the source selection 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm would then select the default resource to stream from, while 
</I>&gt;<i> being given the option for adaptive streaming through the extra 
</I>&gt;<i> information (e.g. delivered through an extra attribute on the &lt;source&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> elements, e.g. @adaptive=&quot;alternatives.xml&quot;). There could then be 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic switching between the files listed as alternatives in the 
</I>&gt;<i> @adaptive file.
</I>
I think that having such a mechanism is probably the best way to go. It is 
orthogonal to the issue of format and media features, which is what 
&lt;source&gt; is really meant to chose between, and it means that the quality 
can be changed dynamically, which is far more likely to be necessary with 
quality than with format and media features.

This requires no changes to &lt;video&gt;; &lt;video&gt; is protocol agnostic.


&gt;<i> Incidentally, it may make more sense to expose the actual components of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;quality&quot; explicitly in media queries, just like they are explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i> exposed both in m3u8 and ismv, in particular bandwidth and resolution.
</I>
Resolution is already exposed. It might make sense to expose bandwidth; 
that is an issue for the CSSWG.

To be fair, making such an algorithm (mapping a user selection to a source

Indeed, if there are multiple axes and videos for each combination, the

It seems like a better solution is to just have the quality be dynamically

Decide how?

Also quality of the encoder, the type of video (e.g. talking heads vs

&gt;<i> These are both best known by the UA (or the user for 3.). Consider the

It seems like we either want the client to negotiate it dynamically, or we 
just want to expose the choices to the user independent of the &lt;source&gt;

I agree, at least for now. I think we should at least wait a while and see

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +   video.parentNode.removeChild(video);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The script should probably be before the video, because it's possible 
</I>&gt;<i> that a UA will fire the error event before having parsed the script 
</I>&gt;<i> defining the function.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> Also, the script results in invalid HTML since it puts &lt;source&gt;s outside 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video&gt;.
</I>
Fixed.
