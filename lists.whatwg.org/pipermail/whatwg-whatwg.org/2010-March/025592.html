</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's no such thing as processing instructions in text/html.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There was such a thing in HTML4, because of its SGML heritage, though 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it was explicitly deprecated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't seem deprecated per 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.6">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.6</A>
</I>
Section B.3.3 says, speaking of SGML features with limited support, which 
at the time of that section's writing included PIs, that &quot;We recommend 
that authors avoid using all of these features&quot;. Section 3.2 specifically 
says &quot;The appendix lists some SGML features that are not widely supported 
by HTML tools and user agents and should be avoided&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Briefly it seems that&lt;? causes the parser to go into Bogus comment 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; state, which is fair enough. (I wouldn't really recommend that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anyone use processing instructions in HTML syntax anyway.) However 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the parser comes out of that state at the first&gt;. Because processing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; instructions can contain&gt; and terminate only at the two character 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sequence ?&gt; this could cause PI processing to terminate early and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; leave a lot more error handling and a confused parser state in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; text yet to come.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In HTML4, PIs ended at the first&gt;, not at ?&gt;. &quot;&lt;?target data&gt;&quot; is the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; syntax of PIs when the SGML options used by HTML4 are applied.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In any case, the parser in HTML5 is based on what browsers do, which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is also to terminate at the first&gt;. It's unlikely that we can change 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, given backwards-compatibility needs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's a simple workaround: don't use PIs in text/html, since they 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't exist in HTML5 at all, and don't send XML as text/html, since 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XML and HTML have different syntaxes and aren't compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/">http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/</A> , it says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;HTML5 defines an HTML syntax that is compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1 
</I>&gt;<i> documents published on the Web, but is not compatible with the more 
</I>&gt;<i> esoteric SGML features of HTML4, such as processing instructions 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.6">http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.6</A>&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> and shorthand markup 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.7">http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.7</A>&gt;.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to me to suggest that backward compatibility can be broken as 
</I>&gt;<i> far as processing instructions (i.e., requiring ?&gt; and not merely &gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> close a processing instruction).
</I>
Backwards compatibility with legacy content can only be broken in extreme 
cases (e.g. for security reasons). That's one of the fundamental design 
goals of HTML5.


&gt;<i> If not, then it doesn't seem clear from the specification that 
</I>&gt;<i> processing instructions are indeed not allowed because the parsing model 
</I>&gt;<i> does allow them, and with processing instructions being 
</I>&gt;<i> platform-specific by definition and not apparently explicitly prohibited 
</I>&gt;<i> by HTML5 (unless that is what you are trying to say here), HTML5 syntax 
</I>&gt;<i> does seem to be compatible with them.
</I>
HTML5 prohibits PIs in text/html. See:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#writing">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#writing</A>

...and notice how PIs are not listed as a possible syntax element.


&gt;<i> But if you are trying to prohibit them for any use whatsoever yet still 
</I>&gt;<i> technically allow them to be ignored for compatibility, it seems this 
</I>&gt;<i> would contradict the statement at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/">http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/</A> that &quot;there is no longer a 
</I>&gt;<i> need for marking features &quot;deprecated&quot;&quot;. Or is the difference that these 
</I>&gt;<i> are forbidden from doing anything but will be allowed (and ignored) 
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely into the future in future versions of HTML?
</I>
They are forbidden but are ignored in this (and probably future) 
version(s) of HTML.


&gt;<i> Btw, I've added a talk section at the wiki page 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Talk:HTML_vs._XHTML#Harmony">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Talk:HTML_vs._XHTML#Harmony</A> to suggest 
</I>&gt;<i> covering XHTML&lt;-&gt;HTML compatibility guidelines specifically, so would 
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate a reply there, so I know whether we can begin edits in this 
</I>&gt;<i> vein on the page.
</I>
Please feel free to edit the wiki or add new pages! Everyone is welcome to 
edit the wiki.
