I was under the impression that Apple were one of the main opposers to
using free codecs in-place of their proprietary QuickTime.

Also, when was the last time you ever knew Microsoft to go with
standarised formats when they can just as easily push one of their own?

Even the image formats in the early days were an area of debate. Does
anyone remember the time when there was still the threat of the
licensing issue surrounding the Gif format? It was this very issue that
cause the PNG format to be created.

Thanks,
Ash
