It got the message, it just got it when the window's document was 
about:blank and before the scripts in that window were ready to receive 
any messages.

If it's same-origin, the simplest solution is to wait for onload.

If it's cross-origin, there is by design no mechanism to expose when the 
page is ready short of the other site announcing it (by sending a message 
to its opener, in this case).


&gt;<i> If this isn't supposed to work, can we state this explicitly in the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec?
</I>
Where would you like it mentioned and what would you like it to say?

I assume you mean provide a mechanism by which messages are queued until 
the page does something that causes the events to be fired?

We could, but it wouldn't actually help in this particular case (since the 
first message is sent to the about:blank document, and I presume we would 
nuke all pending messages upon navigation).

It seems relatively easy to work around the problem in the case of 
windows (just send a message when you're ready), so I'm not sure it's 
worth it.

Only content that tries to communicate to a document while it's loading. 
How common is that likely to be? In the usual case, scripts only run after 
onload, and the iframes delay onload.

The risk is that anyone using addEventListener() would never get the 
message.

</I>
If we changed it, it would be multiple years before IE changed to match. 
Is it worth having IE be non-compliant for that long, rather than having 
interoperability for that long, given that this is basically an edge case 
and quite managable?

</I>
For iframes, onload does that. For same-origin content, onload on the 
target does that. For cross-origin cross-window content, not exposing this 
is by design.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, if we try to dispatch the postMessage events before the load

</I>
Indeed, I wouldn't be a fan of waiting for a load event before sending the 
events.


&gt;<i> There is perhaps a more critical issue that we should consider.  What
</I>&gt;<i> happens if the named window already exists?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider this case:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> window.open(&quot;<A HREF="http://a/">http://a/</A>&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;);

</I>&gt;<i> var w = window.open(&quot;<A HREF="http://b/">http://b/</A>&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> w.postMessage(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect the postMessage would be dispatched in this case, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> event dispatch would probably go to the document at <A HREF="http://a/">http://a/</A> instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://b/.">http://b/.</A>
</I>
That's why you're not supposed to use &quot;*&quot;. This problem always exists -- 
your target window could get renavigated in between your navigating it and 
the task that sends the event being queued.

I believe the spec unambiguously defines what should happen in that case, 
now that everything is defined in terms of the event loop.
