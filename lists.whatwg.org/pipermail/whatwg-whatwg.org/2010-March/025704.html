True, but if bufferedAmount does not byte for byte (or character for
character) match what is fed to the API, what does a few bytes
representing the current overhead matter? IIRC EcmaScript uses UTF-16,
which means that serialization will in most cases make the number of
actually buffered bytes differ from the number of bytes in the original
message buffer. And just because we currently use UTF-8 for
serialization doesn't mean that will always be the case. Thus API users
cannot rely on performing their own conversion to UTF-8 just to find out
exactly how many characters in their message have been sent.

The fact remains that, unless we want to force implementors of the
protocol to match each byte sent over the network with a specific
character in the original message handed to the API, bufferedAmount cannot
represent something unaffected by the protocol. And if we allow
bufferedAmount to be affected by the protocol, why not let it be decided
by the implementation whether or not to include protocol overhead?

As Boris Zbarsky suggested earlier in this thread it might be an idea to
not over-specify this particular part of the API.
