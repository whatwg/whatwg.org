&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat frustrated right now. &#160;I hope this email is not too caustic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The page at <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/</A> causes my
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox to freeze for a minute or more. &#160;Eventually it recovers and it has
</I>&gt;<i> all the pretty do-dads and things but it sure is painful to wait. &#160;And, this

</I>&gt;<i> recomputes (I guess) all the pretty do-dads and things. &#160;The pretty do-dads
</I>&gt;<i> and things just are not worth it to me. &#160;Maybe there is something I can turn
</I>&gt;<i> off but not until after the first wait period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, I downloaded the PDF (the html-letter.pdf) and various tools (like
</I>&gt;<i> Acrobat reader) complain when I try to reflow the document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third, if I save the page above to my disk and open it with dreamweaver and
</I>&gt;<i> try to make it in to an xhtml document, it dies. &#160;The reason I'm trying to
</I>&gt;<i> do that is some html to pdf converters insist upon xhtml format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My ultimate goal (which I have now determined is hopeless) is to put these
</I>&gt;<i> documents on my &quot;nook&quot; so I can read them. &#160;Putting the html-letter pdf on
</I>&gt;<i> my nook &quot;works&quot; but has many UI issues. &#160;I thought if I could redo the
</I>&gt;<i> formatting somehow it might be nicer. &#160;Which leads to my final question or
</I>&gt;<i> request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can the original source of this, whatever it is stored in, be posted as
</I>&gt;<i> well? &#160;There is a comment somewhere that says the W3 version and the whatwg
</I>&gt;<i> version comes from the same source. &#160;It might allow energetic folks to offer
</I>&gt;<i> other formats of the books such as in epub format or some other eReader
</I>&gt;<i> style format.

The HTML5 spec serves, in addition to its role as a spec document, the
additional role of a UA stress test.  It is a massive document with
several scripts running over it on load.  Some browsers and systems
can handle it.  None of the browsers on my computer can do it well
(I'm using a laptop from 2003, though, so my hardware is definitely
out-of-date).

To accommodate people like you and me, we have a multi-page version of
the spec, where each page is much smaller and more easily handleable.
You can reach it at whatwg.org/html5.

Another thing that might help you is to turn off the the scripts
running on the full spec.  You can do that with some undocumented
query parameter, but I forget what it is.  This will turn off some
things like the commenting system and the implementation statuses, but
it will usually allow a modern browser to handle the full spec
document.
