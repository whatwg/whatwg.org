And you're saying that javascript really needs to know about the
frame boundary bytes to detect if it is streaming too fast.
Doesn't sound likely to me.

</I>&gt;<i> This is something we agree about.

</I>
Or we need not to include protocol overhead in this number.
I'd like bufferedAmount to work the same way as .loaded and .total in
XHR+progress events; protocol specific headers aren't counted in.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unsent messages separately just to implement this quirk (see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=50093">https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=50093</A> for a proof of concept).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's true, but I don't know how many of these have already been sent
</I>&gt;<i> unless I perform lots of additional bookkeeping.
</I>&quot;lots&quot;

&gt;<i> Consider sending &quot;data&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> message three times in a row:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> \x00data\xFF\x00data\xFF\x00data\xFF
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we are to exclude protocol overhead in bufferedAmount, and we know
</I>&gt;<i> that there are 8 bytes still queued (a\xFF\x00data\xFF), and we know
</I>&gt;<i> that there were three frames sent (with an overhead of 6 bytes) how
</I>&gt;<i> would we know that the answer is 5?
</I>
You could for example have a circular list for the frame boundary byte
indexes and when something is removed from the queue, you just update
the pointer which points to the first frame boundary byte index in the
queue. Then if the circular list is implemented in a reasonable way,
counting all the frame boundary bytes in the queue is just one
subtraction.
