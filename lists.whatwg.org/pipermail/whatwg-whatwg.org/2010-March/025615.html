Yeah, I've been thinking about that too.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I'm unclear on whether bufferedAmount should return:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. the sum of the count of characters sent?
</I>&gt;<i>     (what would we do when we add binary?)
</I>I believe this is actually what we want.
If web developer sends a string which is X long,
bufferedAmount should report X.

And when we add binary, if buffer which has size Y is
sent, that Y is added to bufferedAmount.

The reason why I'd like it to work this way is that
IMO scripts should be able to check whether the data
they have posted is actually sent over the network.

</I>&gt;<i> 3. the sum of bytes yet to be sent on the wire?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how to pick a solution here. It sounds like WebKit people
