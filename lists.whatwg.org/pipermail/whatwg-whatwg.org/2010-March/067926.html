<PRE>I can see how it is counter productive in the creation of the  
specification, but the fact that such licensing is being considered  
for what is supposed to be &quot;open &amp; free&quot; is counter productive to the  
advancement of web technologies. I feel we cannot allow companies like  
Microsoft and Apple to take advantage of such patents. Allowing the H. 
264 to be a part of the spec without it being royalty free only gives  
those corporations more control over invention and publication on the  
internet. The WHATWG and the HTML5 spec should be focusing on creating  
a breeding ground of innovation and invention. Not looking for the  
quickest route to implementation.

In reply to your question, the outlined goals of the W3C state the  
following in regards to proprietary patents being included in their  
recommendations:
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/patent-practice">http://www.w3.org/TR/patent-practice</A>
establish Royalty-Free implementation as a goal for Recommendations  
produced by new and re-chartered Working Groups;
encourage maximum disclosure of patents that might prevent a W3C  
Recommendation from being implemented on a Royalty-Free basis;
provide a process for addressing situations in which the goal of  
Royalty-Free implementation may not be attainable.
Allowing the H.264 codec in the spec goes against all of these  
principles.
