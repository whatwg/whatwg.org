The specific use case of resizing images before uploading them would also 
require some kind of image object in the worker, unless you had the main 
thread paint each image to a canvas and then grabbed the pixels and sent 
them over, which would be almost as expensive as resizing them in the main 
thread in the first place. To have an image in the worker, we'd need the 
DOM in the worker, and for now, that's not on the cards, as several 
implementations have non-thread-safe DOM implementations.

I imagine we'll handle this use case in due course, though.

If there are specific use cases other than batch image resizing for 
upload, it would be good to have specific use cases put forward. We can 
only evaluate proposals based on the use cases they're intended to solve 
if we know the use cases.

All the browsers should do the same thing, but what that thing is depends 
on the context's spec.

In the case of the 2d context, whenever you invoke methods on the context, 
the bitmap is changed. If another context clears the context, or does 
something more complicated, it has to define how it works with the 2d 
context.

I'm with Maciej on this in that the right solution here seems to be to 
actually support raw binary data. I'll wait a bit longer on this and see 
what happens with the binary support in JS. (WebSocket also needs 
something like this.)

The centering issue is a CSS issue (you probably have to fiddle with 
'display' or 'text-align'). The sizing issue is somewhat by design, 
though. The solution is to set the size manually when the page changes 
size, at the same time as doing the repaint.

Just do it all in one go (not in several timeouts) and you should be fine.

We might want to consider something like that in a future version, 
especially to help with getting animation done smoothly, similar to the 
video timeupdate event. It depends on how people end up using it.

You can do all this today, except that at the start of the onresize event 
(which fires on the Window, not the element) you reset the size of the 
coordinate space manually by setting the height/width attributes. I don't 
really see much of a gain to be had by changing this.

I think when we add path primitives we should add a way of converting a

and other such features. Then the ability to test if a point is in a path 
would solve your problem as well as many others.

I agree that that could make sense, but it's a very sensitive part of the
