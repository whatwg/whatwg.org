</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using CSS to do it actually sounds painful in itself. Doesn't that
</I>&gt;<i> also mean that CSS needs to handle the video scaling too? what about
</I>&gt;<i> the custom button controls? A simple API control that can be used to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically scale the video to fullscreen size is better because
</I>&gt;<i> then all that needs to be done in CSS is handle the controls for
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And like I said earlier, Flash and Java have both been able to start
</I>&gt;<i> in fullscreen mode for a long time now, and nobody has really taken
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of that. And with HTML 5 implementations in browsers, they
</I>&gt;<i> can always offer the option of disabling fullscreen API on load of
</I>&gt;<i> page within browser preferences if you are really that worried.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The objective of the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags are to replace Flash and
</I>&gt;<i> Silverlight in most cases. Fullscreen video is pretty damn huge
</I>&gt;<i> oversight for the &lt;video&gt; tag, and for a reason that I basically
</I>&gt;<i> invalidated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, I don't think people want to be stupid enough to
</I>&gt;<i> implement their own proprietary display methods because it means they
</I>&gt;<i> are trapped with that when the world moves forward. A good example is
</I>&gt;<i> the IE6 dilemma that web developers face now. So many intranets were
</I>&gt;<i> designed with IE6 in mind because they felt that way. When IE7 and IE8
</I>&gt;<i> broke them, they were screwed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a better reason for not including a standardized API for
</I>&gt;<i> handling fullscreen mode for videos, say it. The reasons I'm reading
</I>&gt;<i> so far don't really make sense....
</I>
Do you have an example of Flash video being made full-screen
automatically, without the user intervening at all? I can't say I ever
have, so if the spec must insist on allowing full-screen video through
scripting, then safeguards need to be in place to allow it only to be
triggered from a user action. This could introduce it's own issues, but
that would be up to the user agent to solve I'd imagine.

You do keep mentioning that Flash hasn't been exploited in such a manner
before, but you ignore people when they say that just because a
situation hasn't been exploited yet, doesn't mean it's gone. Also, you
are not asking all the relevant questions about why it hasn't been
exploited, which I'm mentioning here again (and I have before)

Thanks,
Ash
