Do you have a specific proposal for how to handle those particular use  
cases? (Side note: I didn't test how efficient it would be to use  
WebGL to scale or rotate images, in part because I'm not sure how to  
do it. If you know how to code it, I'll gladly add it to my test case.)

BTW although no one has provided specific use cases along these lines,  
I can imagine that Photoshop-style image processing effects may be  
compute-intensive enough that you want to do them off the main thread.  
At least, I think there's some photoshop filters that take noticeable  
time to complete even as native-compiled C++. Maybe WebGL could be  
used to do some or all of those things, it's hard to tell. It seems  
like ImageData is *not* a great way to do them if you can help it,  
since turning a large image into an ImageData is so expensive.

&gt;<i> This does not take away from the fact that the proposal can be (based
</I>&gt;<i> on your data) be used to improve performance when doing scaling.
</I>
It looks to me like it could improve performance quite a lot if we add  
a more efficient way

Actually, given that ImageData is already copiable to a background  
thread, it seems like a good idea to add some form of image data that  
can be copied to a Worker with less work on the main thread. That  
seems valuable even if there is no actual graphics API on the  
background thread.

Maciej
