I have now, thanks. :)  Though I regrettably don't have a lot of time 
now to study it as deeply as I'd like (nor Michal Zalewski's reference 
to UMP), and I can't speak to the technical challenges of browsers (and 
their plug-ins) implementing the type of sandboxing that would be 
necessary for this if they don't already, I was just hoping I could 
articulate interest in finding a way to overcome if possible, and 
question whether the security challenges could be worked around at least 
in a subset of cases.

While I can appreciate such goals as trying &quot;to prevent 
dictionary-based, distributed, brute-force attacks that try to get login 
accounts to 3^rd party servers&quot; mentioned in the CORS spec and 
preventing spam or opening accounts on behalf of users and the like, I 
would think that at least GET/HEAD/OPTIONS requests should not be quite 
as important an issue.

As far as the issue Michal brought up about the client's IP being sent, 
I might think this problem could be mitigated by a client header being 
added to indicate the domain of origin behind the request. It's hard to 
lay the blame on the client for a DoS if it is known which server was 
initiating. (Maybe this raises some privacy issues, as the system would 
make known who was visiting the initiating site, but I'd think A) this 
info could be forged anyways, and B) any site could publish its visitors 
anyways.) I'll admit this might make things more interesting legally 
though, e.g., whether the client shared some or all responsibility, for 
DoS or copyright violations, especially if interface interaction 
controlled the number of requests. But as far the burden on the user, if 
the user is annoyed that their browser is being slowed as a result of 
requests made on their behalf (though I'm not sure how much work it 
would save given that the server still has to maintain a connection), 
they can close the tab/window, or maybe the browser could offer to 
selectively disable such requests or request permission.

I would think that the ability for clients to help a server crawl the 
internet might even potentially be a feature rather than a bug, allowing 
a different kind of proxy opportunity for server hosts which are in 
countries with blocked access. Besides this kind of &quot;reverse proxy&quot; (to 
alter the phrase), I wouldn't think it would be that compelling for 
sites to outsource their crawling (except maybe as a very insecure and 
unpredictably accessible backup or caching service!), since they'd have 
to retrieve the information anyways, but again I can't see what harm 
there would really be in it, except that addressing DoS plans would need 
to address an additional header.

I apologize for not being able to research this more carefully, but I 
was just hoping to see if there might be some way to allow at least a 
safer subset of requests like GET and HEAD by default. Akin to the 
rationales behind my proposal for browser support of client-side XQuery, 
including as a content type (at 
<A HREF="http://brett-zamir.me/webmets/index.php?title=DrumbeatDescription">http://brett-zamir.me/webmets/index.php?title=DrumbeatDescription</A> ), it 
seems to me that users could really benefit from such capacity in 
client-side JavaScript, not only for the sake of greater developer 
options, but also for encouraging greater experimentation of mash-ups, 
as the mash-up server is not taxed with having to obtain the data 
sources (nor tempted to store stale copies of the source data nor 
perhaps be as concerned with the need to obtain republishing permissions).

&gt;&gt;<i> Servers are already free to obtain and mix in content from other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sites, so why can't client-side HTML JavaScript be similarly empowered?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because you would also have access to e.g. IP-authenticated servers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As suggested above, could a header be required on compliant browsers to 
send a header along with their request indicating the originating 
server's domain?

best wishes,
Brett
