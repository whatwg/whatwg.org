I agree that people are less likely to depend on exceptions. The problem 
is feature detection so that you can use the new feature (sending DOM 
nodes) in new clients without failing in old clients. When sending null 
it's easy; when raising exceptions, you have to have two different sends.

</I>
It depends on how critical the DOM node is. If it's just a reference deep 
inside some nested structure, which the other side only uses as an 
additional hint rather than as a required component of the corresponding 
algorithm, it's simpler just to have the UA convert it to null.

So I guess it rather depends on what the use cases are. I don't really 
mind throwing an exception if that's what people think is better, but my 
impression has been that when we do that, it makes things more difficult 
later.
