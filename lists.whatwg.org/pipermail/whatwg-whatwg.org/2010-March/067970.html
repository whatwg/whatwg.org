I would rather argue that throwing an exception makes feature
detection simpler. That way you can do something like:

try {
  w.postMessage(obj);
} catch() {
  var f = {};
  f.x = obj.x;
  f.y = obj.y;
  f.complex = serializeOrCreateOtherFallback(obj.complex);
  w.postMessage(f);
}


If null is sent you have to inside the worker send back an error
message to the sender. The sender has to find the correct data to
send, which could be hard given that the error message is received
asynchronously, and then resend.

&gt;&gt;<i> Additionally, it's unlikely that converting to null is the fallback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior you want for downlevel clients. Likely you'd want to manually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serialize such objects and then parse them on the receiver side. In this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case too an exception would likely help you more than silently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> converting to null.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It depends on how critical the DOM node is. If it's just a reference deep

</I>
Ok, I guess it comes down to if we think it's more likely that people
will send Nodes and other unsupported objects by accident or as
optional data, or because they really want to send them.

Personally my guess it's more likely that they really wanted to.
