This e-mail is a reply to a number of e-mails on various topics relating 
to the more document-related elements of HTML.

The &lt;body&gt; in that example counts as sectioning content. This was not 
stated in the spec previously. I've now made this clear.

Thanks for catching this.

Why? What problem would a semantic tag solve? The default styling here 
seems to not need any particular element; the above is perfectly 
understandable as is as far as I can tell.

</I>&gt;<i> for cue lines that I have to recognize.
</I>
Are there any examples of this in the wild? Since this is technically 
possible today, if it's a use case important enough that we should address 
it, it should be easy enough to find examples of this.

I'm very reluctant to provide features for hypothetical problems that 
don't stem from a real market need. (If we start solving such problems, we 
would fast find ourselves on the path to feature bloat.)


&gt;<i> &gt; You're still not saying why you want this element. What would &lt;attrib&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be good for? What UI would it trigger? How would users or authors 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benefit?

</I>
Wouldn't the Work microdata vocabulary be a better solution to this 
problem?


&gt;<i> I would expect it to be used by some scrapers looking for stock photos.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean. Wouldn't fingerprinting the photos be more 
effective?


&gt;<i> I would expect it to be used with custom CSS for some users, who are 
</I>&gt;<i> really looking for a model or photographer rather than an existing 
</I>&gt;<i> photograph.
</I>
I don't understand this case. Can you elaborate? Maybe an example of this 
use in the wild would help.


&gt;<i> &gt; Why would it be wrong to have an element to style titles [for titles

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Turning around your favorite question, what is the semantic value?
</I>
It provides a way to have appropriate default styling (italics, in the 
visual medium) for a typographic feature that is widely used, while 
allowing it to be easily restyled independent of other uses of italics. 
This is the same benefit &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, etc, have.

In general, I agree. I seem to recall we studied this a few years ago and 
found that it turns out &lt;address&gt; is actually used correctly (per HTML4) 
quite a lot (especially in autogenerated documentation pages), which is 
why we left it as is.

Limiting formats arbitrarily seems short-sighted, even if we are talking 
about eight thousand years from now. In any case, parsing these dates is 
pretty trivial; I don't really see that there is much to be gained from 
using existing parsers. One is more likely to exactly match the spec's 
requirements if writing a parser from scratch.

</I>
Actually it's checking for the presence of the timezone.

However, you're right that &quot;2009-11-16T&quot; misparsed. There was an error in 
an earlier step; the &quot;time present&quot; flag shouldn't have been set to false 
if there was no time parsed, the whole algorithm should have failed 
instead. I've fixed this now. Thanks.


&gt;<i> Perhaps it would be possible to simply replace this algorithm with &quot;try

The change I made seems simpler. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;When the time binding applies to a time element, the element is

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> gracefully. Unless I'm missing something, I suggest dropping the special 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering requirements for &lt;time&gt; completely.
</I>
The idea is to render the date or time in the user's locale, not the 
page's, though I agree that in some cases that could be confusing.

Maybe we should leave the localising behaviour to author CSS and not do it 
automatically by default?

Yeah, this is basically a non-starter, as existing browsers do not handle

Others have given use cases also, but the one I had in mind at the time of

It's not clear to me that there's any particular benefit to marking up

I think long-term the good solution is to have an attribute on &lt;li&gt; that 
overrides the marker entirely; something like:

   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li marker=&quot;a&quot;&gt;foo1
    &lt;li marker=&quot;b&quot;&gt;foo2
    &lt;li marker=&quot;d&quot;&gt;foo3
    &lt;li marker=&quot;e&quot;&gt;foo4
    &lt;li marker=&quot;e-bis&quot;&gt;foo5
    &lt;li marker=&quot;f&quot;&gt;foo6
   &lt;/ol&gt;

...or some such. However, we haven't yet gotten &lt;ol reversed&gt; implemented 
and proven, so it's probably a bit early to start adding features to &lt;li&gt; 
also. If we could get the CSS side sorted out before we add this, we could 
have a CSS-based transition when we finally add it, which would help a lot.

It's tempting. In practice, though, when this kind of thing is usually 
used, it's because the paragraph numbering is critical to the meaning, and 
authors specifically don't want the labels to change when things in the 
list change. So I'm not sure type=&quot;&quot; is quite the semantic we want here.

The above seems like a styling issue.

There are proposed solutions to let you change the list style marker in 
CSS, so I think that's not a problem we need to solve.

That still breaks down without CSS though.

It's not just about &lt;blockquote&gt;, it's any flow element. But I've tweaked 
an example to show this.
