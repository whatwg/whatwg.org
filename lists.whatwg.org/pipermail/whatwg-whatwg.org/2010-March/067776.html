<PRE>2010/3/11 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> AFAIK most browsers are setting a default quota for storage options that is
</I>&gt;<i> on the order of megabytes.
</I>
Could well be, indeed.  It sounded like you'd done some thinking about
the size, and I was curious about how you came up with that number
(versus some %age of available disk, for example).

&gt;<i> Yes, but I think there may be uses of things like storage for non-offline
</I>&gt;<i> uses (pre-fetching email attachments, saving an email that is in a draft
</I>&gt;<i> state etc.)  If it's relatively harmless, like 1mb usage, I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> pop up an infobar, I just want to allow it. So, I don't really want to have
</I>&gt;<i> an infobar each time a site uses one of these features for the first time,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to allow innocuous use if possible
</I>
I think of an infobar as relatively innocuous, and a good balance of
user awareness versus flow interruption, but I repeat my lack of
interaction design credentials!

(Your attachment example is an interesting one, I think: do I get the
request if I request too-big an attachment, but not if it's a small
one?  Or if it's saving a blog post draft that has a bunch of images
in it, vs. one that's 140 chars long.)

&gt;<i> But at the same time, I want
</I>&gt;<i> apps to be able to say up front, at a time when the user is thinking about
</I>&gt;<i> it (because they just clicked something on the site, presumably) &quot;here's
</I>&gt;<i> what I am going to need&quot;.
</I>
OK, I see.  What if we had the named-subquota stuff, and the way you
triggered that request was creation of a named subquota?  That would
also encourage app developers to provide a description of the quota,
and perhaps the sort of &quot;necessary for offline operation&quot; vs &quot;improves
performance&quot; vs &quot;supports additional features&quot;.  The named subquota
creation request could give an initial requested size and estimated
upper bound for the size.  An async event delivered back (or a
callback called) could tell the app what quota it was granted, if any
(or maybe just that it was granted some, but the size limit wasn't
specified).

Mike
