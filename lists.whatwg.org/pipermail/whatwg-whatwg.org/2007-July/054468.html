</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For you to need to use postMessage on otherWindow, you need to be  
</I>&gt;<i> able to do many of these things -- but the entire browser security  
</I>&gt;<i> model is based on not allowing you to do this if the window you've  
</I>&gt;<i> called it on isn't same-origin with you.  You have to punch a hole  
</I>&gt;<i> in this security to allow getting, calling, or enumerating  
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage, but only if the object off which the property is gotten  
</I>&gt;<i> is a Window.
</I>
There's already a handful of Window properties and methods where  
access bypasses the normal cross-domain security checks, such as the  
close() method and the closed property. So this isn't a new concept.  
In WebKit at least we handle these domain security exceptions in a  
unified way, and adding one more method that works the same way would  
not be a big deal.

&gt;<i>  You also have to make the property appear ReadOnly/DontDelete  
</I>&gt;<i> externally, so you can't screw with windows that try to call  
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage on you.  Also, how does this restriction work with other  
</I>&gt;<i> windows which are same-origin?  Do they see only the original  
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage binding, or do they see any modifications that window  
</I>&gt;<i> makes to it?  What if a different window, same-origin, makes that  
</I>&gt;<i> modification?  What if windows pre-HTML5 wanted to communicate via a  
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage binding?  This gets complicated pretty quickly, and to  
</I>&gt;<i> do it all you have to punch a hole through security, and with the  
</I>&gt;<i> fragility of that hole (only on Window, only if &quot;postMessage&quot;, only  
</I>&gt;<i> with the original binding or only if it hasn't been overridden --  
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm not at all sure that's enough) and the specific criteria for  
</I>&gt;<i> that hole to exist, it's going to be easy to accidentally allow more  
</I>&gt;<i> than you wanted to allow.
</I>
I don't think that's the case, given that browsers must already  
implement the other exceptions.

&gt;<i> In contrast, passing a different-origin value into a function is  
</I>&gt;<i> already allowed, and you don't need to do anything special to make  
</I>&gt;<i> it possible.  The only security modification to allow the cross- 
</I>&gt;<i> origin-ness is to make postMessage ignore origins.  This is *vastly*  
</I>&gt;<i> simpler, easier to implement, and hence safer and more secure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll agree that calling postMessage on the other window feels like a  
</I>&gt;<i> better and more intuitive API for users, but if implementers have to  
</I>&gt;<i> make such invasive and potentially-unsafe changes to do it, I think  
</I>&gt;<i> it's the wrong way to do it.
</I>
I would say go with the simpler API, since I don't think either way  
creates extra implementation difficulties.

Maciej
