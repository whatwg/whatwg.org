Applications for exploring colour spaces already have a satisfactory 
solution, as in your examples. Since their focus is on colour selection 
they implement a more elaborate UI that fits their purpose exactly.

Likewise, applications such as Google Calendar implement their own UI 
for exploring the calendar rather than relying on the UI provided by 
&lt;input type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;

However, applications whose focus is not on dates or colours but which 
still need to accept such values as inputs benefit from commodity 
controls; the specifics of how these controls are implemented matter 
little as long as they produce results in a suitable format for 
processing by the application.

A web search for &quot;DHTML Colour Picker&quot; (US or UK spelling) turns up 
hundreds of distinct implementations of an RGB colour picker widget, 
which indicates to me that there is a clear need for such a thing. 
However, I cannot find any general-purpose DHTML colour widgets for 
selecting paint colours that could be classed as reusable components, so 
I'm left to assume that this is a very speciality need which needs to be 
custom-developed in each case.

In short, I am not rejecting use cases that don't fit the solution, I'm 
rejecting use cases that do not fit the scope of the problem as I see 
it. You may percieve the problem differently, of course.
