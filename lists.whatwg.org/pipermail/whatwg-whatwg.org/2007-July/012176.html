I like this idea. It's simple and it's something I've implemented (and 
seen implemented) dozens of times.

&gt;<i> type=&quot;address&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Indicates that the input should represent an address, the user agent may

</I>
I have a little more trouble with this idea, for a number of reasons:
  * Address formats vary from region to region.
  * Sites usually want items like the postal code, state, county or town 
separated from the street address for various reasons. This is not 
catered for by your proposal.
  * To do anything special for this field beyond just displaying a big 
text box some sort of external data source is required, but it is not at 
all obvious what that data source would be or what a good UI for this 
field type might be.

&gt;<i> type=&quot;location&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Same as above but instead of sending an address string it would send 
</I>&gt;<i> latitude/longitude information, this (as opposed to the above) would 
</I>&gt;<i> send a well-formed string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps coordinates/geocoordinates or something else would be a more 
</I>&gt;<i> suitable name for the latter. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I have similar reservations about this one, but at least there is a more 
obvious UI: mobile devices with built in GPS recievers could concievably 
provide an option to fill in the current coordinates.

However, I'm not sure that submitting geographic coordinates is a common 
enough case to warrant an input type of its own. Part of me wants to 
generalize it to be type=&quot;2dvector&quot; and type=&quot;3dvector&quot;, which can then 
represent any 2D or 3D coordinates. I'm not really sure what a UA would 
do to such a field that would be any more useful than two or three 
type=&quot;text&quot; elements, though.
