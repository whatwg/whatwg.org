</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I should have mentioned that I don't think an Offline API will be

</I>

I don't know what you mean. Offline storage is a private cache and can
ignore Cache-Control:private.

&gt;<i> &gt; To me, it looks like the caching mechanisms in HTTP 1.1 can satisfy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this requirement. I think Rob is correct that it adds substantial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; complexity, but it is already required.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In what way is it already required? Browsers are not required to store
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple resources for the same URI. We don't; we just use Vary to help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (in)validate the resource we've got.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean that it is required for web application authors that want to
</I>&gt;<i> scale cheaply and have personalized pages. I don't think you agree
</I>&gt;<i> with me.
</I>

The first app I checked (GMail) doesn't use Vary. If people aren't using it,
it can hardly be a requirement. Actually I'm skeptical that Vary helps much
with scalability, even if it works interoperably across browsers and caches:
presumably most content is going to have one global instance
(Cache-Control:public), or one instance per user (Cache-Control:private).
&quot;Vary&quot; only helps you cache content that falls in between. Do you know of
any examples of such content in existing apps?

&gt;<i> So how would you use Vary here, anyway? Serve pages with &quot;Vary: Cookie&quot;? I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess that could work, but app authors would have to pass no cookies
</I>&gt;<i> except
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the session cookie. That could be difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or you could standardize the cookie value in some way.
</I>

I thought about just specifying a standard session cookie name which always
becomes part of the cache key along with the URI (&quot;HTML5-Session&quot; or
something). But that doesn't work well, e.g. if you want some content to be
indexed by user and some content to be indexed by language.

A simple alternative would be a new server response header, say
X-Vary-Cookie: &lt;cookiename&gt;, which essentially means &quot;Vary&quot; for that
particular cookie (and offline storage uses it as a cue to cache one
resource per cookie value).

&gt;<i> Using an HTTP response header to specify how a URI can map to multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources is a good idea, though. It avoids ambiguities and offers a
</I>&gt;<i> simple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default. If we have to have that feature, this seems like a good way to
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Etag and Content-Location could be used.
</I>

I think they're unnecessary given the above proposal.

so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?&quot;
