<PRE>FWIW, I just talked with our javascript security guys and they very much 
agree with Jeff. Browsers have to deal with accessing properties on 
other windows already, such as otherWindow.open(...). However this is 
very hard to implement safely and we have found numerous security 
problems with this stuff over the years, some exploitable, some not. So 
the fewer properties like this we have the better.

So this is purely an implementation issue. There may be other reasons 
too, but implementation wise it's much simpler, and author wise the 
difference in syntax is simply:

otherWindow.sendMessage(&quot;hi&quot;);
vs.
sendMessage(otherWindow, &quot;hi&quot;);

which really doesn't matter much I would think.

</I>&gt;<i> same-origin, makes that modification?  What if windows pre-HTML5 wanted 
</I>&gt;<i> to communicate via a postMessage binding?  This gets complicated pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> quickly, and to do it all you have to punch a hole through security, and wi
</I>&gt;<i> th the fragility of that hole (only on Window, only if &quot;postMessage&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> only with the original binding or only if it hasn't been overridden -- 
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm not at all sure that's enough) and the specific criteria for 
</I>&gt;<i> that hole to exist, it's going to be easy to accidentally allow more 
</I>&gt;<i> than you wanted to allow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, passing a different-origin value into a function is already

</I>&gt;<i> I'll agree that calling postMessage on the other window feels like a
