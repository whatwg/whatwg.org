I'm not really sure what this scenario entails, perhaps because I don't know
what you mean by &quot;individual internal corporate web server&quot; ... can you be
more specific?

If it is, then I would suggest simply allowing consistency to be partitioned
&gt;<i> &gt; by directory as well. I'm not sure of the best way for the server to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configure that, though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> I'm still not sure why not have consistency enforced at the application

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because it's more complex: we need new APIs to define what an application
boundary is, those APIs have to be interoperably implemented, and we have to
make sure that overlapping boundaries are not allowed, or if they are
allowed, we have to define how that overlap is handled in a sensible way.
We've already seen an unanticipated problem arise because a manifest update
can create overlap.

I appreciate that providing flexibility to application developers is a good
thing. But reducing complexity is also a good thing, for implementors and
actually for application developers too. This is the tradeoff we must
wrestle with.

(I quite like my X-Consistency-Group suggestion because it can be ignored by
Web authors and/or browser implementors without breaking anything, and by
design it cannot lead to overlapping consistency boundaries.)
