<PRE>For some time I've been arguing with W3C/IETF (and anyone else who'd
engage) that ServiceWorkers are the ideal platform to host the Background
Geolocation functionality that Ultimate Web Apps need in order to compete
on a level playing field with Native Apps. The sticking point is usually
the fleeting nature of a ServiceWorkers' lifespan. I have always argued
that it would be madness to kill them immediately and most implementations
seem to agree. (Firefox being the most aggressive at 30secs see Bug at
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378587">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378587</A> this behaviour
prevails even with heaps of CPU/Memory)

Anyway, in order to prove that I am right, and the likes of Jake Archibald
are very much mistaken, I wrote a little Web App, Source code can be found
here: <A HREF="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Rmd3Rn8_hDNW1zSWRoXzBTclU">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Rmd3Rn8_hDNW1zSWRoXzBTclU</A> (There
is a aaa_readme.txt) All code is documented full and contains
meaningful/witty variable names.

Now it still needs a bit of work to provide a trip summary page and map the
trip on Google maps but I think you'll get the idea and most importantly
see the real world, actual, demonstrable relationship between Service
Worker Instances and Geolocation updates? (I wanted to get it out before
the Europeans disappeared for August

So have I done something stupid here? Am I imagining that I only get a new
Service worker instance when I'm stuck at the lights for an extended period
on the way home and position updates are nowhere to be seen? Are my coding
skills lamentable and testing skills non-existent?

If not, then I have no idea why Web Apps are not allowed to satisfy these
legitimate and very desirable user requirements. Sure, we'll get
user-empowerment, permissions, and discovery right but let's get on with
it? The TravelManagerPolyfill.js file is nearly all UA developers have to
do!

Q: Have I understood the ServiceWorker architecture correctly and
implemented a valid heuristic interrogation of ServiceWorker instantiation
over time?
