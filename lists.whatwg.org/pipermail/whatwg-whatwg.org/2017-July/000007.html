A better example.

I run an audio site (all legal, no piracy, I'm anti-DRM but also pro 
intellectual property) where users can select a category.

There could be, say, 12 audios in that category, but the web page only 
displays one. If the user wants to listen to a different audio, they use 
a select menu. If its the same artist, there's enough info in the data-* 
attributes of the select menu items to swap the audio node w/o even an 
ajax call, If different artist, I do make an ajax call because more than 
just the audio node changes.

With JSON-LD I can put structured data for all audios the person can 
play from that page into the JSON-LD. I can't do that with tag based 
structured data unless I make a div display display:none to contain all 
the other audios.

I use libxml2 to create pages so I can modify any part of the DOM at any 
point allowing me to create the JSON-LD from the same data used to 
generate the page, so it is always in sync. I then can stuff it in the 
head node at the end.

That's not possible with many platforms that send content before it is 
finished generating all the page, so JSON-LD for many may not have the 
kind of advantage I can from it, but the ability to describe objects 
available through user actions (such as select menu) but aren't part of 
the DOM when the page is sent is a huge benefit to me over tag based 
implementations of structured data.

Hope that sheds some light on why I had an epiphany when I finally 
stopped to read about JSON-LD.

Now, back on topic, a header would be nice so I only have to stuff it in 
the head when a machine is asking for it ;)
