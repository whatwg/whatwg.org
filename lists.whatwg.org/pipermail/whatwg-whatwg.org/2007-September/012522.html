<PRE>2007/9/10, Weston Ruter:
&gt;<i> I believe there is a contradiction in step 5 of the algorithm defined by Web
</I>&gt;<i> Forms 2.0 section 6.2 &quot;Seeding a form with initial values&quot; [1]. In the last
</I>&gt;<i> clause of the second paragraph it states that all radio buttons and
</I>&gt;<i> checkboxes must be skipped over if they &quot;have the exact name given but have
</I>&gt;<i> a value that is not exactly the same as the contents of the field element.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> However, four paragraphs later it states that checkboxes (and I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> radio buttons as well) may be unchecked by means of an empty field element
</I>&gt;<i> with a matching name attribute:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only values that would have an effect in this example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are &quot;&quot;, which would uncheck the checkbox, and &quot;green&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which would check the checkbox.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously the non-empty value of an input element (such as &quot;green&quot;) is not
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same as the contents of an *empty* field element that has a
</I>&gt;<i> matching name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>
Isn't it related to the paragraph just above: &quot;if it is a
multiple-valued control but it is the first time the control has been
identified by a field element in this data file that was not ignored,
then it is set to the given value (the contents of the field element),
removing any previous values&quot; where &quot;a multiple-valued control is one
that can generate more than one value on submission&quot;? and to the end
of the second paragraph of ths same fifth step: &quot;walking the list of
form controls associated with the form until one is found that has a
name exactly equal to the name given in the field element's name
attribute, skipping as many such matches as is specified in the index
attribute&quot;?

I must concede that the example is not clear at all about that &quot;&quot;
value and when and in which conditions it affects the checkbox.
