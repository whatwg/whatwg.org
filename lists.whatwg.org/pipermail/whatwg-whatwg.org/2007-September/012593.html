We can certainly fix it, I'm just wondering what makes the most sense to 
do so.  Like I said, there's a patch sitting in our (Mozilla's) bugzilla 
that implements the spec-compatible behaviour.  I'd be happy to fix it 
and relnote that it was fixed, while providing a simple workaround 
(which is basically calling beginPath() after calling fill/strokRect etc.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately it isn't really an edge case as it's a relatively

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> example) will clear the path, so expect clearRect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (myCanvasElement.width, myCanvasElement.height) to clear the rect and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reset the path, and other similarly exciting things :-/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Firefox also resets the path on drawImage and putImageData, unlike
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opera and Safari 3 - do people depend on that behaviour too?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That honestly never occurred to me :-O
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't see why people would expect it to, but i wouldn't have thought 
</I>&gt;<i> they'd think that about fill/strokeRect :-/
</I>
Yeah, we do the same thing on drawImage/putImageData that we do no 
fill/stroke (because in the underlying code they're all implemented 
using paths, and there's just one path :).  So, like I said, we can 
certainly fix it, and it sounds like that would be the best way to go.
