In order to offline-enable bugzilla, you would first need to turn it
into an ajax-style application. Where you separate the UI template
from the data.

If you still want to keep the old URLs working, this basically means
capturing (and periodically updating) every single possible entry
point, even though they will all have the exact same content (the ui
template). This doesn't seem reasonable to me.

&gt;<i> I think the problem here isn't necessarily just the query parameters

</I>
That's true, this was a compromise for Gears. Perhaps what's needed is
the concept of aliases. The developer could specify every possible
address that could be used to access this application.

This would be more flexible than the current Gears solution, and I
could see it being used for other things as well.

I still would think you would want some sort of simple pattern
matching so you don't have to list every single bug separately, but it
would also work for the flickr case you describe.
