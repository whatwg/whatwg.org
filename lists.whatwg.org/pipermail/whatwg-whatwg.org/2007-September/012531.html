&gt;<i> 2) Many offline web apps will let you want to make changes, including

</I>

This violates the principle that the offline cache is a cache. It creates
the issue of how to reconcile server pages with client-stored pages.

6) It's potentially costly to download data mulltiple times, so if you
&gt;<i> pull the remote data into a local database, you won't also want to
</I>&gt;<i> pull every page reflecting that data, instead you will want to
</I>&gt;<i> generate templates client-side and insert them into the offline cache.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it seems like a relatively small step from there to having a
</I>&gt;<i> single fallback page to be used for all URIs that are part of the app
</I>&gt;<i> but haven't gotten downloaded in the course of normal use. And this
</I>&gt;<i> would be a huge optimization, since it would save the client the need
</I>&gt;<i> to manually generate each page for a resource of interest that has not
</I>&gt;<i> yet been visited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given point #1, I think this should be based on textual prefix
</I>&gt;<i> matching of the URI, not just dropping the query (the scheme and
</I>&gt;<i> authority sections should be treated specially, of course, it should
</I>&gt;<i> not be allowed to have a fallback page in someone else's security
</I>&gt;<i> domain). This will allow matching paths and also matching only
</I>&gt;<i> specific kinds of queries (where the first parameter is set to some
</I>&gt;<i> specific value, say). However, to make offline and online mode diverge
</I>&gt;<i> as little as possible, I think perhaps such fallback pages should
</I>&gt;<i> apply only when offline. When online, the UA should go to the real
</I>&gt;<i> page. With the prefix-based fallback page solution, I'm not sure it
</I>&gt;<i> will be necessary to also support individual client-generated pages.

Thoughts?


It sounds reasonable to me, a lot better than option 2).
