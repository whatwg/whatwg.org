bittorrent or RSS isn't relevant to the mobile phone user, or the host
of websites, both of these care about the bandwidth of what they're
actually using, reducing bandwidth in requests makes the sites more
usable, as the request size is smaller.

&gt;<i> The processing power doesn't seem like a big thing either -- comparing

</I>
No you don't, if there's no FOO field submitted, you don't need to do
any comparison on it for anything, it's just immediately rejected.

&gt;<i> Not to
</I>&gt;<i> mention that you'd have to do the comparisons anyway to support down-level
</I>&gt;<i> clients.
</I>
There's lots of features in WF2 that are only relevant to new clients,
so what's the problem with this one?

Jim.
