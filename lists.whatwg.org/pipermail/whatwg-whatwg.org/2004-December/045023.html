<PRE>Related to this, it would be nice to have a standard, simple way for a 
browser session to &quot;log out&quot; of its HTTP authentication.  Currently with 
some UAs, a user must to close all of his or her browser windows and/or 
tabs in order to be able to log in as someone else.  Granted, there are 
ways to trick the browser into popping up the authentication box, but it 
would be nice to have a standard &quot;log out&quot; feature.

The way HTTP authentication is implemented now assumes that the user 
will never want to change usernames.  This is simply not true in every 
case, even if it is for the majority of cases.

I'm not sure of the best way to accomplish this log out functionality 
(headers? HTML tags?) but this certainly would be a helpful feature in 
the web application that I develop.  Has anyone else experienced a 
situation in which this feature would be useful, or have any ideas about 
how it could be accomplished that would be within the scope of this group?
