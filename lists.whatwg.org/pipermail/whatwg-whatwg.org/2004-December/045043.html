</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Isn't it the point of deprecation that implementors may opt not to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It depends (the word &quot;deprecate&quot; doesn't imply this on its inverse; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have to check with each instance of a deprecation to find what the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case is). However, in many cases, as, I believe, with U+FEFF, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deprecation is intended to discourage potentially harmful or confusing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use, without breaking backwards compatibility with existing content 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and thus still requiring it of implementations).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> According to <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#38">http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#38</A> a data format or 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol may choose to ignore the BOM in the middle of a string.
</I>
HTML doesn't choose that, though, so that isn't relevant to us. (Thanks 
for the pointer, though.)


&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm still uncomfortable with using a deprecated character that 
</I>&gt;<i> has a very special other meaning as a magic marker in WF 2.0.
</I>
I'm not overjoyed with it myself, but I haven't got any better ideas. The 
current system works quite well, and certainly works better than the &quot;[]&quot; 
prefix that I first suggested. Do you have a better idea?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Still, limiting the choice of syntactic sugar in the submission 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; format has the feel of Appendix C to it.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There aren't really any restrictions beyond not breaking XML 1.0 rules 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and being compatible with both non-namespace-aware and namespace-aware 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parsers. Which, of the remaining restrictions, did you want to remove?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In principle all restrictions on the choice of syntactic sugar, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess it is now good enough for practical purposes.
</I>
As far as I can tell the only restrictions now are about not using a 
prefix, which we need to have to handle non-namespaced servers easily.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The spec doesn't say what the recipient is supposed to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; _recognised_ elements or attributes, either. What servers do is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty much up to the servers, not much we can do about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Attempts to influence the ad hoc works of the ViewSourceClan might 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; indeed be futile. However, what you write in the spec could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; influence what the developers of server-side frameworks (eg. Struts) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It could, I guess. Did you have any particular ideas in mind? I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really know what to add.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had a general &quot;must ignore unknowns&quot; rule in mind. For unknown 
</I>&gt;<i> elements, treat as if the start and end tags were not there. After this, 
</I>&gt;<i> ignore text children of the submission element. Ignore unknown PIs.
</I>
I've added a note that gives a suggestion on how to handle unexpected 
content. Let me know if you think that's ok. I don't think making it 
normative makes any sense; it's not like we can do anything to ensure 
compliance anyway, so making it law would only serve to create a 
generation of law-breakers (as it were).
