<PRE>
I just finished going through the comments I have seen for the Web Forms 2 
draft. (I have plenty of comments outstanding for the Web Apps 1 draft, I 
just went through the WF2 ones for now.)

I intend to publish another snapshot Call for Comments for the Web Forms 2 
draft proposal shortly.

As far as I know there are no outstanding issues on the current draft, and 
every issue raised has been answered, in one form or another.

If you have any comments on the draft that you have already sent but which 
you do not think were addressed, please send them again (and my apologies 
for missing them).

New comments are of course welcome too, but I'll probably publish the 
snapshot before I address them. I expect after this snapshot is published 
we'll be able to wrap up the WF2 draft in a few weeks and look into maybe 
submitting the draft to a standards organisation, publishing a test suite, 
encouraging implementations and so forth. (There are no solid plans yet 
though people, don't get excited...)

Work will then focus on the Web Apps draft.
