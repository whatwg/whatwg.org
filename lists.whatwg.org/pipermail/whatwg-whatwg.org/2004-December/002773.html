At the point where it becomes impossible to convince the UA authors to
implement this stuff.

The whole point of all of the Web Forms stuff is to improve user
experience, by moving more validation etc. to the client.   Stopping
the user from having to needlessly upload large documents does a lot
more to improve user experience, than many of the properties (as these
are just done by script today, so most users don't know there's a
problem.)   The things being described above can't be done, so the
user (who likely doesn't understand about bit-depths and sampling
rates) gets feedback from the UA without having to upload the file
first, which takes time and is frustrating for them.
 
Of course some things are more complicated than others, but since
every visual user agent already deals images, the implementation cost
isn't that high, so it's well worth requesting.

Features that can't be added with script, are the most important
things to add, not stuff that people are already using javascript for,
there's no reason for users stopping using their script.

Jim.
