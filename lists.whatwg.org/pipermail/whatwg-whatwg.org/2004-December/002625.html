As far as I know, even standard widgets don't do syntax highlighting 
editors, but I may be wrong.

True. Maybe a WF3 feature, then.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure why. It has almost no side effects since it's just a hint 
</I>&gt;<i> to the client and doesn't affect the actual data being uploaded in any 
</I>&gt;<i> way. It it perfectly backwards compatible. Since many HTML applications

</I>&gt;<i> for better-than-notepad text editing in HTML. Without information about 
</I>&gt;<i> the data type expected, UAs can't really provide this. With that 
</I>&gt;<i> information they can.
</I>
Because it has almost no side effects since it's just a hint to the 
client. It just isn't something that people are going to implement any 
time soon (it's exactly the kind of feature that gets delayed to later 
releases over and over), and I'd rather not add features to WF2 that 
aren't going to have a big impact or be easy to implement well.

At this point I'm looking for things to drop, not things to add. :-)
