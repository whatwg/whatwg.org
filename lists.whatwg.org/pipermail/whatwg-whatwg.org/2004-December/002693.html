But in that case the data /is/ submitted (and you do validity checking, 
etc. on it). This is for data that's /not/ submitted, and is assumed by 
the server to be the default. It's logically impossible for that data to 
be hostile unless the default is hostile.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I mentioned earlier. Any proposal for how to handle this would have 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to address that issue first.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which problem is this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a checkbox is not checked, the UA does not submit the value of the 
</I>&gt;<i> checkbox with the form.  Therefore, how is the server supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> differentiate between when the checkbox has been unchecked by the user 
</I>&gt;<i> and when the UA is not submitting it because the field has not changed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This also creates other problems.  Given a situation where a user is 
</I>&gt;<i> editing a &quot;comments&quot; textarea, assume the user wants to erase the 
</I>&gt;<i> comments.  How can the server differentiate between the user 
</I>&gt;<i> legitimately erasing the comments and the UA not submitting it because 
</I>&gt;<i> the field has not changed?
</I>
As far as I can tell, for textareas (and input type='text', etc.) The 
value of '' (i.e., empty) is submitted normally, so that wouldn't be a 
problem.

For an easy workaround for the checkbox problem, input type='checkbox', 
'radio', and select (any others?) could just always be submitted. Anyone 
else have a better solution?
