Oh, I assure you RSS is relevant to the mobile market.

My point was that cutting down on bandwidth by removing fields from the 
submission does almost nothing to help anyone as far as bandwidth goes. 
The form submission doesn't even appear on the radar of anything, at this 
point.

You have to check it is given or not. The extra cost of checking what 
value it has is minimal.

It doesn't give any advantages (not any particularly important ones, at 
least). The other features, like the repetition model, which require 
server-side support for both models, at least provide important 
advantages, like not requiring server round-trips for each click.


Another problem with not sending fields that haven't changed is that it 
wouldn't be compatible with checkboxes and multi-select controls (they 
would act the same as those that haven't changed).
