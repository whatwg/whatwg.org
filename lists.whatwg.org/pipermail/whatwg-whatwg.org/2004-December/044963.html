Once again, if the data's not submitted, it can't be hostile.

&gt;<i> It's quite possible that the field changed while the page was being shown

Collision detection can fix this--and should probably be used anyway, 
since it's just as likely that a collision will mess up the data if all 
fields are submitted.

&gt;<i> (Note that there is also the problem of how to handle checkboxes that I 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned earlier. Any proposal for how to handle this would have to 
</I>&gt;<i> address that issue first.)
</I>
Which problem is this?
