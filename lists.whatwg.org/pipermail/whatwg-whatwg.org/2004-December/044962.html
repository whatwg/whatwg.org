Be very careful with this -- you should always assume that the 
client-provided data is hostile, and not trusted.

</I>
It's quite possible that the field changed while the page was being shown 
to the user, though, for example if the user loaded the page twice, 
modified the pages differently, and then submitted both, or if two users 
did the same thing (unknowingly). Since different databases would have 
different ways of handling this, I don't know that we would want the UA to 
be doing anything about it. It seems like it would be best to let the 
server handle it as appropriate.

(Note that there is also the problem of how to handle checkboxes that I 
mentioned earlier. Any proposal for how to handle this would have to 
address that issue first.)
