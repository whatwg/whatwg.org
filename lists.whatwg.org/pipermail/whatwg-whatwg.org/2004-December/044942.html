Well RSS /is/ relevant to a server operator (though bittorrent isn't), 
so perhaps it's a valid point. I really don't have any experience in 
this, so I'll defer to anyone with more (perhaps you could ask the 
bugzilla admins on IRC?)

s/immediately rejected/assumed to be the default/, but yeah, that's 
pretty much exactly my point.
