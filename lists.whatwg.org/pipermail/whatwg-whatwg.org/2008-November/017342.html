That study was based on the first set of data I obtained, but I have since 
made many more detailed studies.

</I>
The problem solved by rev=made (or rel=author, which is the same) is the 
problem of how to indicate the author of the page. We have solved that 
problem in HTML5 (with rel=author).

The idea of defining rev values because nobody uses rev is what I was 
referring to when I said that it was backwards.


&gt;<i> If you have a more up to date study on link relationships, please can I 
</I>&gt;<i> have a link?
</I>
I have not published anything recently, but the results have not changed 
significantly since that 2005 study was published.

Author confusion, implementation cost, testing cost, cost in writing 
tutorials, cost in writing validators, etc.

</I>
We are considering dropping &lt;address&gt;, though on balance it is used 
correctly quite a lot too, so it's not clear whether removing it would be 
better or worse overall. &lt;br&gt; we probably can't drop since it is used so 
widely and does have some pretty important valid uses.
