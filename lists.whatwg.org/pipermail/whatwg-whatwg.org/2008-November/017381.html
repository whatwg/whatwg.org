<PRE>
I've added a type=search input type.

There was a lot of feedback asking for this, but it all basically said 
nothing more than asking for it and sometimes giving a use case. If I 
missed something specific that isn't included below please let me know.

True. Not sure there's much we can do about that here though.

This seems redundant with oninput=&quot;&quot; (on the control) and onsubmit=&quot;&quot; (on 
the form).


&gt;<i> incremental - if present, onsearch fires on every keypress, and on 
</I>&gt;<i> clicking the cancel button; otherwise onsearch fires when pressing Enter
</I>
This seems redundant since we have two events for those two cases.


&gt;<i> results - if present, shows a little magnifying glass icon, which helps 
</I>&gt;<i> to visually identify the field as a search box
</I>
I don't understand why the icon wouldn't always be present.


&gt;<i> results=10 - the magnifying glass functions as a drop-down menu 
</I>&gt;<i> containing a history of the last (whatever number) search terms
</I>
I don't understand why the UA wouldn't always provide this.


&gt;<i> autosave=&quot;foo&quot; - define a unique name to identify the search history (so 
</I>&gt;<i> the same history may be shared across multiple search boxes, even across 
</I>&gt;<i> different domains)
</I>
This seems like something we should consider in general for all text 
fields. I'm not sure a domain-specific identifier is the right answer 
though. Isn't the &quot;name&quot; field enough?


&gt;<i> At first glance it looks like onsearch (when combined with incremental) 
</I>&gt;<i> is identical to oninput, but onsearch fires after a slight delay, so 
</I>&gt;<i> that if the user rapidly types multiple characters, the search doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> begin until after a sufficient pause in typing.
</I>
The spec requires that of oninput.

</I>
Actually it can be a security risk if you can trick the user to click 
(which isn't that hard in practice).

</I>
That's not enough of a reason to add it to the spec. :-)

This would be a CSSWG request; please follow up on this with them.

I don't propose to add anything to the spec regarding the autodetection of 
search fields; I don't think we need interop on that particular feature.
