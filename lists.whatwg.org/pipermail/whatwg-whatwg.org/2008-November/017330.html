<PRE>It does seem like OOM indeed but it may be different because with multiple
threads it's much easier to get into effects like this, you don't need to
allocate a lot of objects.For example, lets say there is something like
this:

function computeStuff() { ... }  // takes 100ms to compute stuff
setInterval(computeStuff, 10);

in normal situation, the single-threaded JS implementation would not
normally post another callback until the computeStuff() returns - since
timers are not checked nor timer events fetched until the previous callback
yields control, it's hard to implement this in a way that can produce
out-of-memory. In multithreaded implementation (with Workers) the main
thread that processes timers could stuff the Worker's queue at 10ms
intervals while the Worker will process those callbacks at 100ms interval.

Same can happen with postMessage. On a fast computer it will just work, on a
slow it can go out of memory.

Not sure if it should be reflected in the spec itself though...
