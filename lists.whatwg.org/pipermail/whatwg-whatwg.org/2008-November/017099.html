(I've not replied to all the e-mails on this thread because they are 
mostly redundant with this one. Please let me know if you made a point 
regarding &lt;input type=hidden&gt; that you think needs changes to the spec 
that I missed.)

I agree, but it seems that having the hidden inputs be inside the next
&lt;li&gt; of a list, or the next &lt;td&gt;, or whatever is appropriate, isn't much 
to ask for.

For Perl, it's definitely possible (and relatively easy) to just store the 
hidden inputs until the next suitable place (e.g. the next cell).


&gt;<i> Assuming you are in control of the whole page's markup at once then I

</I>
I don't really follow why it's so hard in that case, but maybe you should 
use a better templating language. :-)

Yes, foster parenting, and also the form element pointer, etc.
