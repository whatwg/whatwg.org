</I>&gt;<i> I'm inclined to say that the latter option (of selectElement.options

</I>&gt;<i> Consider, for example, where two elements are selected in a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When javascript is not active, then any selected element will submit to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So it should be clear that the UA cannot implement this on its own

</I>&gt;<i> element.
</I>
I think your conclusion is backwards.

Rather than saying:

   to implement this options would have to be rejiggled -&gt;
       browsers implementing this would mean options rejiggled -&gt;
           scripts would break -&gt;
               browsers can't implement this

I think the line of reasoning should be:

   browsers implementing option rejiggling would break scripts -&gt;
       options can't be rejiggled

This still lets browsers implement the rendering-level tweaks that 
improve the user interface, without having to affect the page.


&gt;<i> &gt; Doing the transform on the server would also work, though it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a horrible idea in general.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this does not belong on the server.  It's a lot of information 
</I>&gt;<i> flowing back and forth between the server to no good end.  It also means 
</I>&gt;<i> that the benefit is only available on a per site basis, which means 
</I>&gt;<i> adaption would be very slow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (What other users select may or may not correlate with your own 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desires well enough to break the natural ordering -- that is something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an author really ought to determine by hand.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if this were to be implemented server side, it would imply 
</I>&gt;<i> being done on a per user basis.
</I>
I agree that doing this server-side is also not ok.


&gt;<i> Ian Hickson has written:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This seems like something the user agent could do on its own without 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help from the page,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As discussed above, the UA cannot uniformly do the SELECT element 
</I>&gt;<i> rejuggling when there is javascript interaction with the SELECT element.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, since it's impossible to know whether this would happen, the 
</I>&gt;<i> page must let the UA know.
</I>
Or, the UA could simply not jiggle the options in the DOM.


&gt;<i> There is an alternate approach.  The UA could assume that there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> javascript interaction of any select element, and then if there is, it 
</I>&gt;<i> would revert the affected select element to the standard behaviour and 
</I>&gt;<i> not engage in reordering. This standard reverting could be overridden by 
</I>&gt;<i> the frequencyLimit setting.
</I>
If we assume the DOM isn't affected, then I don't see any problems 
blocking browser implementations here, nor any need for the attribute.


&gt;<i> &gt; or that the server could do on its own without help from the client. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure that the language needs to be adjusted to support this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The server could implement this, but it's a massive hit, both in terms 
</I>&gt;<i> of development (ie. needs to be repeatedly independently developed) and 
</I>&gt;<i> bits flying across the internet.  And takeup would be VERY slow.
</I>
I agree that the server shouldn't be involved.



In conclusion, this still seems like something a browser could implement 
independently of the page. This would improve all pages, not just the ones 
using the feature. Thus, I have not added this to the spec.
