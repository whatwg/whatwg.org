</I>&gt;<i> join the mailing list to continue the discussion, so here it is:
</I>
Apologies if this is the umpteenth time I've replied to this, or if I 
haven't replied to it yet. :-) My system gets confused when I have e-mails 
that cover multiple issues, as I end up copying the e-mail to each 
relevant folder and then I end up dealing with the same e-mail over and 
over. I've covered most of the points you wrote below.


&gt;<i> I've just finished taking a look at the working draft of HTML 5 and 
</I>&gt;<i> thought I'd share my thoughts. Clearly, HTML 5 is meant as an evolution 
</I>&gt;<i> of HTML 4, which has both its good and bad points. Accordingly, there 
</I>&gt;<i> are both good and bad parts of the specification. My thoughts are as 
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>     * I almost laughed when I saw the irrelevant attribute. First, 
</I>&gt;<i> because that's a word that web developers throw around a lot and second 
</I>&gt;<i> because I can't imagine ever using it. The spec says, &quot;When specified on 
</I>&gt;<i> an element, it indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer, 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant. User agents should not render elements that have the 
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant attribute specified.&quot; If it's not relevant, why is it in the 
</I>&gt;<i> page in the first place? Further, do you know how many people will spell 
</I>&gt;<i> this wrong 100 times before they spell it right? Unless there's a deeper 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning or requirement behind this attribute, I think it's just a waste 
</I>&gt;<i> of a section.
</I>
I've renamed it to &quot;hidden&quot;.


&gt;<i>     * I'm not sure what the &lt;section/&gt; element offers over the &lt;div/&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element. I thought the purpose of the &lt;div/&gt; was to indicate a section 
</I>&gt;<i> of the page. If there's not a clear distinction between these elements, 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see the need for a second one.
</I>
&lt;div&gt; is really intended as the &quot;last resort&quot; element. &lt;section&gt; is 
intended to relieve it of some of its uses.


&gt;<i>     * I'm a bit unsure of the &lt;article/&gt; element. As with &lt;section/&gt;, it 
</I>&gt;<i> seems only vaguely different from &lt;div/&gt; and too focused on solving the 
</I>&gt;<i> question of what markup to use for a blog.
</I>
Blogs are important. :-)


&gt;<i>     * The &lt;aside/&gt; element really pushes the boundaries of marking up 
</I>&gt;<i> literary devices. I'm not sure enough web developers know what an aside 
</I>&gt;<i> actually is. Short asides are typically indicated by parentheses and I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't see any reason not to keep doing that (seriously). Any element 
</I>&gt;<i> that requires someone to ask an English teacher when it should be used 
</I>&gt;<i> is probably a bad idea.
</I>
&lt;aside&gt; really could be called &lt;sidebar&gt;, we just didn't want people to 
think it was only useful for asides that were on the side of the page.


&gt;<i>     * I understand the concept of the &lt;dialog/&gt; element but it's named 
</I>&gt;<i> completely wrong. The point is to markup a conversation between two or 
</I>&gt;<i> more parties. The problem is that the word &quot;dialog&quot;, when in used in 
</I>&gt;<i> user interfaces, refers to small windows that can be interacted with. 
</I>&gt;<i> When I first read about this element, I assumed it was a way to indicate 
</I>&gt;<i> that part of the page is a dialog window outside of the normal flow of 
</I>&gt;<i> the document (which I thought was cool). After reading the rest, I was 
</I>&gt;<i> disappointed to find out that wasn't the intent. I'd rename this element 
</I>&gt;<i> as &lt;conversation/&gt; or &lt;discussion/&gt; to avoid such misunderstandings.
</I>
Unfortunately those names aren't necessarily right either. This is a 
recently reopened issue, though, so it may change, we'll see.


&gt;<i>     * The ping attribute on the &lt;a/&gt; element is a stroke of pure genius. 
</I>&gt;<i> We've been left hacking solutions for click monitoring for way too long.
</I>
Just out of interest, do you have any opinion on whether ping=&quot;&quot;, as 
specified, would be something you would use?


&gt;<i>     * The &lt;dfn/&gt; is another that stresses the understanding of 
</I>&gt;<i> grammatical structure for web developers. The intent is to designate the 
</I>&gt;<i> defining instance of a term, abberviation, or acronym. Does that make 
</I>&gt;<i> sense to you? If it did, give yourself one point; if it didn't, don't 
</I>&gt;<i> feel bad, most people won't get it. Again, any element that leaves 
</I>&gt;<i> people scratching their heads probably isn't necessary or useful.
</I>
&lt;dfn&gt; is used enough that it's probably worth keeping (it's in HTML4 too).


&gt;<i>     * Speaking of confusing, I've read the section about the &lt;meter/&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element five times now and still have no idea what it's used for.
</I>
Is the new text better?


&gt;<i>     * I'd like to see some treatment of rich text input controls. Right 
</I>&gt;<i> now we all use a hack (an iframe in design mode) that has to be copied 
</I>&gt;<i> over into a form field to be submitted. It would be nice to have this 
</I>&gt;<i> handled natively and have reliable HTML formatting of that content 
</I>&gt;<i> (instead of the per-browser implementations we have now).
</I>
contentEditable is being made more consistent, but there's still no 
non-scripted solution, since nobody can agree on what elements to allow.


&gt;<i> Also &quot;contenteditable&quot; doesn't solve my issue with rich text editing. It 
</I>&gt;<i> solves the ability to do it, but not a straightforward way to do it in 
</I>&gt;<i> the context of a form and submit it back to the server without some 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediary code. My point is that there should be a way to submit rich 
</I>&gt;<i> text in a form by default, without needing to write extra JavaScript 
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>
Unfortuantely, it's an area with so many different people with so many 
different needs that I don't know that we'll ever be able to have a single 
solution there.


&gt;<i>     * I'd like to see a common attribute that can be used on any element 
</I>&gt;<i> to indicate information related to the element. I'm tired of fighting 
</I>&gt;<i> the custom attribute battle. The fact is that it's a very common need to 
</I>&gt;<i> include extra data related to an element. I'd propose a &quot;reldata&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute (short for &quot;related data&quot;) be considered as an optional 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute on all elements. We then, as developers, could use that 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute as we see fit and the document would still validate (for 
</I>&gt;<i> people who care about such things).
</I>
We've added the data-* family of attributes for this.
