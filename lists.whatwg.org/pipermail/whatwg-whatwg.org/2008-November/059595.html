Glad to hear it!

I can see it's usefulness. The way I see it the spec is not set in stone 
yet, and you could still use @rev (if you don't mind the odd HTML5 
validation error), it's just up to the particular xfn/microformats 
parsers to actually do something with it, but I don't know much about 
the current parsers.

Maybe you could ask forum or commenting services like disqus.com if 
they're interested in putting @rev=&quot;reply&quot; attributes on the comments 
where they link back to the source or to another comment. That'd 
generate a good real-world example. It could also be used on the 
permalinks for blog comments - in wordpress the links go to the 
url+fragment identifier of the comment. It could be a nice way to index 
and timeline online 'conversations' through blog posts and comments, 
especially if they're across disparate websites.

Anyway I'm rambling way off topic now, sorry.

Cheers,
Rob
