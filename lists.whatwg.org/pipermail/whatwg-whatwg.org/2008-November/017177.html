Nov 14, 2008, &#1074; 2:30 AM, Ian Hickson &#1085;&#1072;&#1087;&#1080;&#1089;&#1072;&#1083;(&#1072;):

&gt;<i> I believe that the idea that the API for shared and dedicated workers
</I>&gt;<i> should be the same is misguided. The spec used to make the two cases
</I>&gt;<i> identical. The result was confusion, and the dedicated case was much  
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> complex than necessary.
</I>
This is the strongest argument for having separate interfaces of all  
presented, but in my opinion, it misses some important data points:
- Was introducing a new interface the only way to resolve the  
confusion? Maybe renaming a method or two would have had a positive  
effect?
- Did it help resolve the confusion?
- What kind of danger the confusion was? Would authors write under- 
performing and unreliable code, or refuse to use such a cumbersome API  
at all? Or was is just a momentary delay for some, resolved quickly  
and harmlessly?

I don't remember any of these discussed here.

&gt;<i> Shared workers and dedicated workers are fundamentally different and  
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> different needs, and we should expose these needs in ways optimised  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> the two cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic need is that dedicated workers be able to have a two-way
</I>&gt;<i> communication channel with their creators, and shared workers be  
</I>&gt;<i> able to
</I>&gt;<i> have a two-way communication with each user of the worker.
</I>
I think that this argument is false. It is normal for a single API to  
support multiple use cases.

Replace Worker with XMLHttpRequest, and we end up with separate  
interfaces for GET and POST.

&lt;skipped code samples&gt;

&gt;<i> For dedicated workers though that's way more complexity than we want  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> require of authors -- why do they have to listen for a port when there
</I>&gt;<i> will always be exactly one? So it makes sense to use
</I>
It is not true that there will always be one - additional ports can be  
passed in via postMessage().

&gt;<i> Now, we've at this point made the two different already, so as to  
</I>&gt;<i> simplify
</I>&gt;<i> the dedicated worker, so we could (and the spec does) make the  
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> worker even simpler while we're at it.
</I>
Returning to the XMLHttpRequest example, we really can combine open()  
and send() for XMLHttpRequestGET, but not for XMLHttpRequestPOST.  
Generally, the interfaces can be very different if we try to.

&gt;<i> One way to do that is to bury the ports into the Worker and global  
</I>&gt;<i> scope
</I>&gt;<i> objects. If we do one side, though, we have to do the other, because  
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> would be really weird to have a message channel that half-acts like a
</I>&gt;<i> two-port channel and half doesn't.
</I>
I agree.

&gt;<i> For example, if we bury it, we
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't expose .close(), since it's better for the worker to be  
</I>&gt;<i> closed
</I>&gt;<i> using the actual .close() or .terminate() API, but if we only &quot;bury&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> side, then one end could close the pipe and not the other, and we'd  
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> to make sure we expose .onclose on the buried end, and so forth.
</I>
I agree that if we have a direct interface for messaging on one side,  
we should have it on both sides.

&gt;<i> So, we end up with what the spec has now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what we have now is better than making dedicated and shared
</I>&gt;<i> workers superficially the same (as the spec used to be, and as the  
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> involved in this thread argued was bad) is more confusing for authors.
</I>
I'd be more that happy with a separate interface if the objects  
actually behaved differently. One example of a good reason to have  
separate interfaces was recently proposed here: shared workers should  
outlive their creators. This is the sort of difference that would make  
having a separate API reasonable, in my opinion.

&gt;<i> At this point, if the only arguments for changing the API are &quot;it's
</I>&gt;<i> confusing for authors&quot;, then I'd rather not change the API. We got to
</I>&gt;<i> where we are today by carefully considering what would be better for
</I>&gt;<i> authors. We could continue going back-and-forth and reverting earlier
</I>&gt;<i> decisions until the cows come home, but I see no benefit to doing so.
</I>

I don't think it's inappropriate to continue back-and-forth until  
there is at least one reasonably complete implementation validating  
the spec. Currently, the Mozilla implementation is very different in  
spirit, not supporting MessagePorts at all.

&gt;&gt;<i> * I still don't buy the utility of passing around MessagePorts, so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggest we table that for v2. It can always be added back later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since they so drastically affect the API design, I think putting  
</I>&gt;<i> them off
</I>&gt;<i> is a mistake. We might end up constraining ourselves in unobvious  
</I>&gt;<i> ways.
</I>
I agree.

- WBR, Alexey Proskuryakov
