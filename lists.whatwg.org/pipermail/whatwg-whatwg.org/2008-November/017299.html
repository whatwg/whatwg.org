&gt;<i> &gt; o be precise, the most commonly used value was rev=&quot;made&quot;, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equivalent to rel=&quot;author&quot; and thus was not a convincing use case. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> !! rel-author doesn't mean the same as rev-made eg:
</I>
In which cases doesn't it?  If A is the author of B then B was made by
A, surely?

&gt;<i> &quot;I have just finished this new  &lt;a rel=&quot;author&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;<A HREF="http://coolsite.co.uk/&quot;">http://coolsite.co.uk/&quot;</A>&gt; Cool website&lt;/a&gt; check it out&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> that would mean &lt;<A HREF="http://coolsite.co.uk/">http://coolsite.co.uk/</A>&gt; is the author of the referring  
</I>&gt;<i> page which is nonsense.
</I>
Indeed, but nobody is suggesting that would be appropriate.

&gt;<i> rev=&quot;author&quot; is clearly better semantics in the  above case?
</I>
Yes, if using rev.  Without rev it could be written as rel=made, because
made is the opposite of author.

&gt;<i> &gt; The second most common value was rev=&quot;stylesheet&quot;, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaningless and obviously meant to be rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And that was the basis of the whatwg decision to drop rev? (I am not
</I>&gt;<i> criticizing just trying to understand it)
</I>
Data of what people have actually done, with the existence of current
browsers and standards, informs many decisions.

&gt;<i> surely all it needed was to define some rev values (the same as rel)
</I>&gt;<i> and people will start using rev correctly?
</I>
What semantics do you think authors who wrote rev=stylesheet were
meaning to convey?  Presumably not that the webpage containing it is the
style-sheet for the CSS file that it linked to -- so it's definitely a
mistake by the author.

If what the author meant to write was rel=stylesheet then HTML 5 is
surely an improvement, by dropping the confusing rev=stylesheet?

Or do you think something else is commonly meant by rev=stylesheet?

&gt;<i> &gt; We therefore determined that authors would benefit more from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; validator complaining about this attribute instead of supporting it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anything that could be done with rev=&quot;&quot; can be done with rel=&quot;&quot; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an opposite keyword, so this omission should be easy to handle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are some cases where that is just not possible.
</I>
Which?
