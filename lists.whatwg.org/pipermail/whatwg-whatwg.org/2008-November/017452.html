Well, that's what we have been doing.

I was looking forward where this could be used by somebody who isn't an 
expert (think Microsoft Webfolder client or Apple WebDAV FS driver), and 
where running an HTML parser (in the kernel?) would be problematic.

</I>&gt;<i> whatever, and submit the form. Just like a user.
</I>
To do that, it would need to *capture* that information somewhere. I was 
assuming the whole point in the exercise was to avoid having to pop up 
an HTML based UI...

BR, Julian

PS: But even if it doesn't help authenticating without an HTML based UI, 
this could be useful because it allows non-interactive clients to 
understand that they're looking at a login form, not the &quot;real thing&quot;.
