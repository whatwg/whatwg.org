<PRE>
As can be seen in the feedback below, there is interest in improving the 
experience with logging in and out of Web sites.

Currently there are two main mechanisms: HTTP authentication, and 
cookie-based authentication with a form login.

Benefits of form authentication over HTTP authentication:
 - supports creating an account
 - supports recovering a lost password
 - supports showing the login form inline with other content
 - supports styling the login form
 - supports an obvious way of logging out from within the page

Limitations of form authentication:
 - no way to indicate that access is being denied because the credentials 
   passed were wrong or because there were no credentials passed
 - insecure when unencrypted

It seems to me that the first limitation of form authentication could be 
removed by inventing a new WWW-Authenticate challenge that means &quot;reply to 
the form in the page&quot;. I have now specified such a value in HTML5 (since 
it is specific to entity bodies that contain HTML forms):

   challenge = &quot;HTML&quot; [ form ]
   form      = &quot;form&quot; &quot;=&quot; form-name
   form-name = quoted-string

(There's no &quot;credentials&quot; value for this scheme, since the login is done 
as a POST to a login script and then the server sets proprietary login 
information, like a cookie using Set-Cookie.)

So when you get to a page that expects you to be logged in, it return a 
401 with:

   WWW-Authenticate: HTML form=&quot;login&quot;

...and there must be a &lt;form&gt; element with name=&quot;login&quot;, which represents 
the form that must be submitted to log in.

We could also make HTTP login work better, but frankly I'm not convinced 
there's much point. The form login cowpath is so commonly frequented that 
not only has someone already gone and paved it but it has also been 
tree-lined, has garbage collection scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
and will be electing a representative at the next general election.

With all this in mind:

</I>&gt;<i> .... which would be quite okay, since &quot;authentication required&quot; isn't

</I>&gt;<i> regexp &quot;401*.unauthorized&quot;. That would be weird, but hardly weirder than 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet Explorer's current length-based overriding of server error

</I>
I think this is still a good idea, but requires nothing of HTML5.


&gt;<i> &gt; We could get around that by saying that you can include 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WWW-Authenticate headers with 200 OK responses as well (nothing in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTTP seems to say you can't), and that if you do, then the bar is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shown as above (&quot;interactive user agents should provide a non-modal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authentication interface&quot;). Then, if you've already sent your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; credentials and you get a 401, then you get the 401 page and the bar, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of the modal dialog. ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's a simpler option. :-) (Provided that current browsers still 
</I>&gt;<i> ask for authentication even when given a 200 OK.)
</I>
I don't think they do now, but it's something we can move towards.

I think the above idea (of using WWW-Authenticate with 200 OK) is a good 
one, but is something we should let the HTTPWG worry about.

We could introduce a &lt;bb type=&quot;logout&quot;&gt; option, but frankly what's the 
point. Logout already works for regular form-style login, and as mpt notes 
above, UAs could implement HTTP auth better already.

This is an interesting proposal, but as noted above, I'm not sure there's 
much point trying to save HTTP auth at this point. People wanting security 
should use SSL, IMHO. Digest isn't really that secure, and Basic is worse 
than session cookies.

This is already possible with forms authentication, so I don't see much 
point adding stuff to HTML to make it possible with HTTP auth too.

I think these ideas are very interesting, but I don't think HTML5 is the

I don't really understand what problem the above solves that isn't solved

I don't see why this is an less expensive than SSL. SSL is expensive 
primarily in terms of CPU power to do the encryption, but if all you are 
doing is the login form, then the cost is mostly mitigated.

There's no point doing the login over unencrypted HTTP, since if someone 
can sniff the password, they can just as easily MitM you and just grab the 
password unencrypted.

Also, as Philip Taylor mentioned, this seems like it would be vulnerable 
to an offline dictionary attack.

The first two costs are flat fees much like the cost of setting up a 
regular HTTP server. The problematic cost is #3, which your proposal 
suffers from as well.

I agree that Aaron's proposal doesn't seem to give us much over Digest.
