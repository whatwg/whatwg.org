<PRE>Hi,

below some more feedback about the initial proposal.

This addresses the &quot;forms served with status 200 status are bad for 
non-interactive/non-HTML-based clients&quot; (partly). That is good.

It does not try to address the &quot;standard HTTP authentication doesn't 
work well in HTML-based UAs&quot;, which we discussed in Mandelieu. That's 
ok; it's useful to think about these as separate issues.

For security reasons, I'd prefer that to be &quot;the &lt;form&gt; element&quot;, 
instead of &quot;a &lt;form&gt; element&quot; -- having multiple copies of the name in 
the same document should be considered a fatal error.

Which doesn't mean that it's not a good idea to think about it 
nevertheless, but let's just keep that in a separate discussion.

I think asking for credentials when the status is 200 would be a bug.
