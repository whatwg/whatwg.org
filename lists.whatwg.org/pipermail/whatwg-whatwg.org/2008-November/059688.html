Web Apps WG,

Would it be possible to add setCapture() (as supported in IE; see below) 
to DOM3 Events? It seems more appropriate to have it there than in HTML5.

Note that I don't think we'd need releaseCapture(); we should just say 
that capture is canceled when the mouse is released if it was captured. 
This gets around the problem of unbalanced set/release.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. You have a fluid layout where the columns are resizable via 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; javascript by dragging the borders. The content of one of the columns 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is an iframe. You begin dragging the border between it and the column 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to the left, but as soon as the cursor goes over the iframe, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dragging functionality stops because you have now entered the context 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of the iframe. Thus it becomes impossible or at the very least very 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; difficult to resize the column containing it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems like a bug. It seems like we would want to address this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly rather than requiring authors to disable iframes when doing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drags (especially since that wouldn't help with things like plugins or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever). Wouldn't the better solution be to provide some sort of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism to say that while the mouse button is down, all the mouse 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move events should go to the element that got the mousedown event?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would probably work, though I don't know if limiting it to the 
</I>&gt;<i> specific element itself might cause any issues. For instance, something 
</I>&gt;<i> lacking in the HTML5 drag and drop specification is the ability to 
</I>&gt;<i> define a handle for the element that is being dragged. With the drag and 
</I>&gt;<i> drop in javascript libraries you can define a handle (a different 
</I>&gt;<i> element) that drags the draggable element. If the handle 
</I>&gt;<i> property/attribute is null then the element itself is it's own handle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there is a mousemove event in the current context (the parent 
</I>&gt;<i> document let's say) that is checking to see if the user tries to drag an 
</I>&gt;<i> object over it. We don't want to break the ability to create this sort 
</I>&gt;<i> of collision detection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might be safer to say that while the mouse button is down, all the 
</I>&gt;<i> mouse move events should be processed in the same &quot;context&quot; the 
</I>&gt;<i> mousedown event occurred in. So if the mousedown occurs in the parent, 
</I>&gt;<i> mouse move events should be processed in the parent until a mouseup 
</I>&gt;<i> occurs. Likewise, if a mousedown occurs in the child iframe, mouse move 
</I>&gt;<i> events should be processed in the child iframe until a mouseup occurs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet there should also probably be some way to disable this or a way for 
</I>&gt;<i> one context to release mouse ownership to another context. I did a 
</I>&gt;<i> search for drag and drop between iframes, and there is at least one 
</I>&gt;<i> application out there that can fake this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://intersoftpt.wordpress.com/2007/03/16/drag-and-drop-across-iframes/">http://intersoftpt.wordpress.com/2007/03/16/drag-and-drop-across-iframes/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, from a forum post on drag and drop between iframes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;I have *heard* of people doing this by using the parent window to 
</I>&gt;<i> store and mediate state between the 2 child iframe windows. So when a 
</I>&gt;<i> drag was in progress, and the mouse coord reached the edge of the iframe 
</I>&gt;<i> window, you would notify the other iframe to start listening for 
</I>&gt;<i> mouseover events and create the illusion of a seamless &quot;drag&quot;.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In these cases you would probably want a way to change context during 
</I>&gt;<i> mousedown, though the change should probably be controlled from the 
</I>&gt;<i> context the mousedown occurred in. That context gets to decide if it 
</I>&gt;<i> relinquishes control of the mouse move events before the mouseup or not. 
</I>&gt;<i> By default it should not.
