&gt;<i> Despite your claims to the contrary, given the way that the &quot;rel&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute and the related keywords are defined, rel=author does in fact 
</I>&gt;<i> convey the semantics that rev=made did.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No It doesn't Reverse and Inverse properties are key factors of any 
Semantics without both @rev and @rel  there is hardly any semantics at 
all just a one way stream of information, which most of the time you 
have to guess what the Authors intentions were.

rel=author on the whole only relates to published documents,  rel=made 
relates to  Documents, Music, Photos, Videos, Sunday Lunch! Literaly 
anything that can be *made*
&gt;<i> Removing &quot;rev&quot; doesn't affect previous pages, as they continue to be valid 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML4 if they were valid HTML4 before, and UAs can continue to support 
</I>&gt;<i> those semantics for as long as they want to support those pages.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I cant see anyone abandoning HTML4 soon at least not in my 
lifetime....but you never know....
&gt;<i> Furthermore, since the definition of &quot;rel&quot; in HTML5 allows relationships 
</I>&gt;<i> in either direction to be defined, there is no need anymore for a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> rev=&quot;&quot; attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>So essentially @rel in html5 is breaking the semantics of @rel just 
because it cant deal with @rev?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, who's going to be doing the informing?
</I>
The publishers of HTML5

&gt;<i> Nobody did it in the past ten 
</I>&gt;<i> years, why would they do it now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Nobody over the last 10 years informed Authors very about Validation and 
Accessibility, but they are at last getting to grips with it..
&gt;&gt;<i> the fact that a high amount of authors are using rev-made is Inspiring 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to say the least, because every made link type is a claim of ownership, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not authorship two totally different semantics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe it is unrealistic to expect authors to split semantics that 
</I>&gt;<i> finely. 
</I>They do...
&gt;<i> Authors who today use rev=&quot;made&quot; could equally well use 
</I>&gt;<i> rel=&quot;author&quot; without loss of generality IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OK then example:

I am the author of numerous websites and I decide (like many people do) 
to place some links on my homepage a portfolio If you like.
My Homepage is at : <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>
Here is my link &lt;a rel=&quot;author&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;">http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;</A>&gt;Groovy 
Site&lt;/a&gt;

Above Statement (In HTML4) says

&lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt; Authored  &lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt;

Which Is rubbish its the other way round

The Same statement in HTML5 will say (because @rel is a reverse and 
inverse link type)

&lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt; Authored  &lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt;
and
&lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt;  Authored &lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt;

@rel seems to be redundant because describing the link with rel=&quot;author&quot; 
doesn't actually tell you who the author of a is page you have to guess, 
the statement is at most only half correct and again not expressing any 
real semantics....


[edits]

&gt;<i> If there are redundant features that are only used 0.2% of the time, we 
</I>&gt;<i> should probably remove them, yes. Are there any?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>A lot considering that the average website only uses 19 elements[1] How 
many are there in HTML5?

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Unfairly From what I can tell

Thanks for your help anyway
