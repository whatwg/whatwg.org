They are in fact _defined_ to be equivalent in HTML5:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#link-type-author">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#link-type-author</A>

I don't understand what benefit there would be to saying that HTML pages 
about photos couldn't use rel=author. That seems weird.



&gt;<i> &gt; either direction to be defined, there is no need anymore for a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate rev=&quot;&quot; attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So essentially @rel in html5 is breaking the semantics of @rel just 
</I>&gt;<i> because it cant deal with @rev?
</I>
Could you provide an example of how rel's semantics are broken?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the misuse of &quot;stylesheet&quot; is trivial and only a matter of informing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; authors of their error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, who's going to be doing the informing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The publishers of HTML5
</I>
That would be me, and I assure you that I am not going to be doing any 
informing of the millions of authors who make this mistake.


&gt;<i> &gt; Nobody did it in the past ten years, why would they do it now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody over the last 10 years informed Authors very about Validation and 
</I>&gt;<i> Accessibility, but they are at last getting to grips with it..
</I>
On the contrary, both the validation and accessibility efforts have spent 
massive amounts of resources on evangelisation.


&gt;<i> &gt; I believe it is unrealistic to expect authors to split semantics that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They do...
</I>
The data suggests that the majority of authors do not distinguish subtle 
semantics like this. (I mean, more than 99% of people don't use rev=&quot;&quot; at 
all, for instance.)


&gt;<i> &gt; Authors who today use rev=&quot;made&quot; could equally well use rel=&quot;author&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without loss of generality IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK then example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am the author of numerous websites and I decide (like many people do) 
</I>&gt;<i> to place some links on my homepage a portfolio If you like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My Homepage is at : <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my link &lt;a rel=&quot;author&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;">http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;</A>&gt;Groovy 
</I>&gt;<i> Site&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Above Statement (In HTML4) says
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt; Authored &lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which Is rubbish its the other way round
</I>
So say it the other way around, e.g.:

   &lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;">http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;</A>&gt;Groovy Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You don't actually need a rel=&quot;&quot; at all. What problem is the rel=&quot;&quot; 
solving for you?

If you really wanted to use rel=&quot;&quot;, you could define a new value, say 
&quot;sample-work&quot;, and use that:

   &lt;a rel=&quot;sample-work&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;">http://somegroovysite.com/&quot;</A>&gt;Groovy Site&lt;/a&gt;


&gt;<i> The Same statement in HTML5 will say (because @rel is a reverse and 
</I>&gt;<i> inverse link type)
</I>
I don't know what you mean by &quot;reverse and inverse&quot;; where do the 
specifications define it that way and what does it mean?


&gt;<i> &gt; If there are redundant features that are only used 0.2% of the time, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we should probably remove them, yes. Are there any?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot considering that the average website only uses 19 elements[1] How 
</I>&gt;<i> many are there in HTML5?
</I>
Many more; are any redundant? We've removed &lt;acronym&gt; because of it being 
redundant with &lt;abbr&gt;, I don't really know of any other redundant ones.

I believe this makes my point more strongly than anything else that has 
been said in this thread. Even someone who is asking for rev=&quot;&quot; to be kept 
(and thus can be assumed to be informed on the matter) makes the very 
mistake that our data shows is a common mistake. How can we expect your 
average HTML author, who couldn't care less about HTML, to get this right 
if even we get it wrong?
