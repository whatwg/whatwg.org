Yes, it does. But since session cookies are just that: cookies -- it isn't. An authentication token is different from a session cookie in that it can be persistent, based on the user's preferences, it won't be blocked by default anywhere (once supported, that is) since it isn't using the same fragile technology used by advertisers to track users and wreck their privacy and it won't have any of the problems cookies have since it isn't a cookie.

</I>
Yes, among other things. Since we're inventing a new token here, we can place any semantics and functionality in it we want. Re-using cookies would take us exactly zero steps in the right direction. Cookies have their place, but authentication is theoretically imho not one of them. In practice, there's really no other alternative today.
