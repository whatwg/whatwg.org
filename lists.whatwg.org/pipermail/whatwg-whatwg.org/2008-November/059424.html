I haven't written a summary of changes because this is a rather involved 
issue and I'd like everyone who has an opinion to actually read this.

I missed a few e-mails sent in the last few hours in this reply, as I 
started this yesterday. I'll read and respond to those in a bit.

There are other ways to kill the worker:

  The worker is orphaned    | Maybe[1]| Yes       | Yes      | No
  The browser dies          | Yes     | No        | No       | No

Also, your &quot;No&quot; in the top-left cell is really a Maybe[1], since if the 
script doesn't stop then it'll trigger the Kill algorithm.


&gt;<i> This seems excessively messy. The number of differences in the columns 
</I>&gt;<i> and the number of maybes seems bad. I propose the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Remove the &quot;Kill a worker&quot; algorithm and use &quot;Terminate a worker&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere it is used.
</I>
I strongly disagree with that. The whole point of having a distinction is 
that we don't want scripts just being killed willy-nilly when the user 
navigates away from the page. Scripts in the page itself aren't 
terminated, why would we want such drastic behaviour in the threads?


&gt;<i> * Make WorkerGlobalScope.close() not process any more events. I.e. make 
</I>&gt;<i> setting the 'closing flag' to true always clear out all events except a 
</I>&gt;<i> single close event.
</I>
Again, this seems bad as it would mean that if you navigated away from a 
page that happened to use a worker, you could get data loss.


&gt;<i> * Always fire close on tangled ports. In many cases this will be a no-op 
</I>&gt;<i> since we're doing it in workers that are being closed. However if the 
</I>&gt;<i> port is in another window or a shared worker this might not be the case.
</I>
I thought we weren't doing this because it exposed the details of garbage 
collection?

Right now only load errors are reported.

I'll wait til the API is more stable before exposing script errors and the 
like at all (whether on a global onerror or whatever). It is noted as an 
XXX issues in the spec source.

I don't recall the precise reason, but I seem to recall concern over

That's what we used to have. It was changed because having shared and 
dedicated workers be too similar was considered bad API design. To be 
honest I somewhat agree with the position that says they should be 
distinct. I don't understand the benefit of making them the same.

I removed startConversation() from the specs altogether, since it was 
causing too much confusion. It was only a convenience method (it was 
exactly equivalent to creating a new MessageChannel followed by calling 
postMessage with one of the new ports), so this doesn't change anything 
about the actual API.

I've snipped reference to startConversation from the following feedback, 
as noted below, to avoid confusion over this.

We have different objects for shared and dedicated workers for a multitude 
of reasons:

 1. Shared workers have a name.
 2. Dedicated workers have a method to terminate() them.
 3. The two have different communication needs (see below for detail).
 4. It allows us to have clearly named constructors, which makes for
    more self-documenting code.
 5. It's less confusing to authors if the two concepts are distinct, 
    since they have such different use cases and use patterns.

The reasons for mixing them back together (as they used to be in the 
original proposal) seem very unclear to me.

MessagePorts do have an onclose; it's separate from the onclose of the

This is just like if the client sent &quot;PING&quot; instead of &quot;ping&quot;. It's not a

Sure, you have to set up a convention for messages for your worker. I 
don't see this as a problem.

I believe that the idea that the API for shared and dedicated workers 
should be the same is misguided. The spec used to make the two cases 
identical. The result was confusion, and the dedicated case was much more 
complex than necessary.

Shared workers and dedicated workers are fundamentally different and have 
different needs, and we should expose these needs in ways optimised for 
the two cases.

The basic need is that dedicated workers be able to have a two-way 
communication channel with their creators, and shared workers be able to 
have a two-way communication with each user of the worker.

Assuming we use MessagePorts on each end for communication, then we have 
to get the ports to each end somehow.

On the outside, we can expose a port on the worker object:

   var worker = new Worker(url);
   worker.port...

   var worker = new SharedWorker(url, name);
   worker.port...

...and on the inside we can have either the port provided through an 
event:

   // case A
   var port;
   onconnect = function(e) {
     port = e.port;
   };

...or accessible in general:

   self.port // case B

The latter (B) doesn't work for shared workers, since there are multiple 
ports in that case, so for shared workers we have to use the former (A).

For dedicated workers though that's way more complexity than we want to 
require of authors -- why do they have to listen for a port when there 
will always be exactly one? So it makes sense to use 

Now, we've at this point made the two different already, so as to simplify 
the dedicated worker, so we could (and the spec does) make the dedicated 
worker even simpler while we're at it.

One way to do that is to bury the ports into the Worker and global scope 
objects. If we do one side, though, we have to do the other, because it 
would be really weird to have a message channel that half-acts like a 
two-port channel and half doesn't. For example, if we bury it, we 
shouldn't expose .close(), since it's better for the worker to be closed 
using the actual .close() or .terminate() API, but if we only &quot;bury&quot; one 
side, then one end could close the pipe and not the other, and we'd have 
to make sure we expose .onclose on the buried end, and so forth.

So, we end up with what the spec has now.

I think what we have now is better than making dedicated and shared 
workers superficially the same (as the spec used to be, and as the people 
involved in this thread argued was bad) is more confusing for authors.

At this point, if the only arguments for changing the API are &quot;it's 
confusing for authors&quot;, then I'd rather not change the API. We got to 
where we are today by carefully considering what would be better for 
authors. We could continue going back-and-forth and reverting earlier 
decisions until the cows come home, but I see no benefit to doing so.

Since they so drastically affect the API design, I think putting them off 
is a mistake. We might end up constraining ourselves in unobvious ways.


If there are specific points that I have not explicitly replied to that 
materially affect the arguments and my responses, please let me know. I 
tried to take all the input above into account, but it was non-trivial, 
since much of it was contradictory, with even individual people putting
