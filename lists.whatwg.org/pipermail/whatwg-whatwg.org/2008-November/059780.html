I came to the same conclusion and already implemented it (with a
custom application-specific scheme) in an Enterprise app (the custom
scheme accepts both HTML form, i.e. cookie, and an Authorization
request-header &#8211;we're using it for XMLHttpRequests to &quot;bypass&quot; any
cookie and therefore allow more than one &quot;user session&quot; in the same
&quot;browser session&quot;).

&gt;<i>   challenge = &quot;HTML&quot; [ form ]
</I>&gt;<i>   form      = &quot;form&quot; &quot;=&quot; form-name
</I>&gt;<i>   form-name = quoted-string
</I>
RFC2617 states that &quot;The realm directive (case-insensitive) is
required for all authentication schemes that issue a challenge.&quot;

It works great in IE6/7 (I think I tried IE8b2 but I'm not sure),
Safari 3(Windows) and FF2/3.

Google Chrome pops the classic auth dialog, and when you dismiss it it
&quot;correctly&quot; shows the HTML form.

Opera 9 (don't remember the actual version number but I try to keep it
up-to-date with the &quot;stable&quot; versions, i.e. no beta version) shows an
error page saying something like &quot;unsupported authentication scheme&quot;.

&gt;<i> There's also one more case to consider. Many sites react to an unauthed
</I>&gt;<i> request by *redirecting* to the login page.
</I>
That would have to be changed to a 401 if you want to become a &quot;good citizen&quot;.

Varying the response depending on the authenticated user (or
no-authenticated-user case) is bad practice already (even if more than
widely used, e.g. in e-commerce).
You should either put the &quot;session id&quot; in the URLs (i.e. create new
temporary resources that only one user is authorized to access and
that will &quot;expire&quot;/disappear when the user logs out, to speak in ReST
terms), or put the user id in the URL (if the state is shared between
&quot;sessions&quot;, including simultaneous ones; i.e. create user-specific
resources), or use IFRAMES and/or JavaScript to load the varying parts
independently of the rest of the page (the page that is served to all
users, authenticated or not).

&gt;<i> You can already handle the case of content that's available unauthenticated,
</I>&gt;<i> but would potentially differ in case of being authenticated by adding
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Vary: Authorization
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to a response.
</I>
I seem to recall Roy T. Fielding arguing *against* that when we were
discussing user-specific service documents in the Atom Protocol group.
