</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Of course, but I don't think having &lt;small&gt; in the language closes any
options.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Second: Suppose I want to collect all copyright notices from 1000
</I>&gt;<i> websites (don't ask me why, I just want to), how am I to do this when they
</I>&gt;<i> are marked up in &lt;small&gt;s? I will definatly end up with a lot of text that
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to do with copyrights (and probably miss a lot of copyright
</I>&gt;<i> notices as they are marked up differently) Whereas If they were maked up in
</I>&gt;<i> (for example) &lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt; I could retrieve it all based on the
</I>&gt;<i> class-name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;That would be a wonderful perfect world.  I'd like the copyright date as
</I>&gt;<i> well, so I can retrieve only things copyrighted in the last ten years.
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming that metadata will exist is a fool's errand.  The fact is that if
</I>&gt;<i> you are searching for copyright notices, the most efficient way is likely to
</I>&gt;<i> just search for the string &quot;copyright&quot; and the (c) symbol.  That'll net you
</I>&gt;<i> copyright notices with a high accuracy, and some training on real data can
</I>&gt;<i> yield further rules to improve the data-mining accuracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You say it yourself, only in a perfect world where all websites in the
</I>&gt;<i> world would be written in the same language would your &quot;solution&quot; work.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunatly I would miss out on all the chinese copyright stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Of course.  But would you expect chinese speakers to use class=&quot;copyright&quot;
on their pages anyway?


&gt;<i> But another example (based on &quot;siemens&quot;) wouldn't it be nice if I could
</I>&gt;<i> tell Google I am looking for a person named &quot;Siemens&quot; so it would ignore the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;brand&quot;-name?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Certainly.  But at this point you're expecting authors to mark up their
pages with metadata every time they mention someone's name.  The use of &lt;b&gt;
doesn't prevent this, but your use-case certainly requires quite a lot more.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;While we're hoping for copyright notices to be marked up as &lt;span
</I>&gt;<i> class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;, though, why not wish for &lt;small class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;?  If
</I>&gt;<i> you're going to be providing metadata, it works the same.  Is it that you
</I>&gt;<i> believe people won't provide a special class for copyrights if the &lt;small&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tag already gives them the preferred display?  Do you believe that everyone
</I>&gt;<i> will automatically use class=&quot;copyright&quot; to mark up their copyright
</I>&gt;<i> notices?  What if they use class=&quot;copyright-notice&quot;?  Or class=&quot;license&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> Or any of a million other distinct possibilities that would destroy any
</I>&gt;<i> naive attempt to datamine based on a particular class name?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that would have to be defined in the standard, wouldn't it? I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> saying -again- it should be defined NOW, but at least leave the door open.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no problems with using small over span, neither one is correct as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I can see, in this context. Using &quot;copyright&quot; instead of &quot;license&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;copyright-notice&quot; would have to be defined somewhere, either in the
</I>&gt;<i> standard or in an externally maintained &quot;document&quot; that is accepted as &quot;best
</I>&gt;<i> practice&quot; or &quot;standards related&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Okay, then we have no issue with &lt;small&gt;.  There has been some discussion,
btw, about standardizing a set of normative class names.  You should be able
to turn something up about it.

PS: I find it very difficult to respond to rich-text/html messages as they
&gt;<i> seriously mess up the indentation. Sorry therfor if this message is unclear
</I>&gt;<i> as original message and reply are mixed up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No problem; it was clear enough.  The only richtext I use is quote levels,
and with the conversation context nearby anyway, it's not difficult to
puzzle out when it occasionally messes up.
