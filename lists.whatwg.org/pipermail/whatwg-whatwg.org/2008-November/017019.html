[ideas snipped]

If I understand you correctly, you suggest a very basic set of 
structural elements, which are to be flexibally qualified by the authors 
via the class attribute. The composition of that set should follow some 
kind of basic language logic.

If I understand HTML correctly, it provides a limited set of 
pre-qualified elements, some of them with a more structural emphasis, 
some of them with a more semantic (or or even presentational) one. The 
composition of that set does not follow a higher logic, but the everyday 
needs of the common web author (or what the writers of the spec assume 
this is).

(I hope this is understandable; I am not a native English speaker, either.)

So, supposed I got these both correctly, you do not really talk about 
HTML, but about an alternative approach of marking up text documents. I 
personnally find thinking about alternative approaches very interesting 
and useful for opening up one's mind.

I agree with you that there are many things in HTML that have a purely 
historic legitimation, such as the h1-h6 elements. &lt;h level=&quot;n&quot;&gt; would 
be much more flexible. I personnally often get mad about the IMO totally 
unlogic set of form elements. I would highly appreciate such thigs to be 
cleaned up in a new HTML spec. But of course the task ot those who 
design HTML5 is not to re-invent the wheel, but to evolve the existing 
HTML in a highly backwards-compatible way.

I made the experience when I suggested a new set of form elements, that 
I did not get much response on those contributions. The same might 
happen to your suggestions, as they are on a more basic level, than the 
HTML5 works act on. I don't think you can blame the people working on 
HTML5 for this, as they are quite far in the process, and your 
suggestions do rather set new starting points, than contribute to the 
acutal state of the work.
