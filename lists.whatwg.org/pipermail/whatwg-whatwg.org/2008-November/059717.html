You can still do that. You also have the opportunity to use a 401 on the 
login page itself.

It may be that few enough people want to use the HTTP mechanisms for this 
that the feature will need to be removed when the spec progresses to the 
next level.

The problem is that you'd basically have to duplicate the entire form, 
since login forms can be arbitrarily complex. If the bot has the username 
and password, why not also give it the username field name, password field 
name, and login script url? Just consider them part of the credentials.
