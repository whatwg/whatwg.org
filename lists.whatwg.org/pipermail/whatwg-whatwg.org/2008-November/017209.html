Indeed, and that is what the spec says. However I think in many cases 
for XHR that is probably not what is the most useful. Consider for example:


example.html:

w = new Worker(&quot;<A HREF="http://docs.google.com/MSWordParser.js&quot;">http://docs.google.com/MSWordParser.js&quot;</A>);
w.onmessage = function (e) {
   doneLoadingDoc(JSON.parse(e.data));
}
w.postMessage(&quot;/documents/report.doc&quot;);


MSWordParser.js:

onmessage = function(e) {
   xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
   xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;, e.data, false);
   xhr.send();
   res = mainParse(xhr.responseText);
   postMessage(JSON.stringify(res));
}


The above won't work since the URL is relative to the worker JS file, 
not relative to example.html. So an absolute URI always needs to be used 
which sort of sucks as is unintuitive from the point of view of most DOM 
APIs today.

I don't really have a good solution to propose though. We might need to 
add an API for resolving relative URIs and require that scripts use that 
manually.
