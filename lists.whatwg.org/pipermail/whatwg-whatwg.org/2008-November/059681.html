 &gt;&gt; QuickTime has used this method this since it started supporting
VBR 

 &gt;&gt; mp3 in 2000, and in practice it works quite well. I am sure that
there 

 &gt;&gt; are degenerate cases where the initial estimate is way off, but 

 &gt;&gt; generally it is accurate enough that it isn't a problem. An
initial 

 &gt;&gt; estimate is more likely to be wrong for a very long file, but each
pixel 

 &gt;&gt; represents a larger amount of time in the time slider with a long 

 &gt;&gt; duration so changes less noticeable.

 &gt;

 &gt; Well, I do believe this works fine for audio (which usually hasn't a 

 &gt; wildly fluctuating bitrate if you e.g. average over a second or two), 

 &gt; I'm mostly concerned about video. An example for an outrageously off 

 &gt; estimate would be the trailer for &quot;Generic space-pirate movie&quot;.

 &gt;

 &gt; The first few seconds would be mostly a static
green/red/yellow/whatever 

 &gt; screen (&quot;This pirate movie has been rated ARRRRRR!&quot;) - this part would


 &gt; be coded with like 100 kbit/s or less. The next few scenes (this is a 

 &gt; trailer, after all) would mostly show exploding ships, genetically 

 &gt; engineered mutant parrots attacking space-adventurers and a few cuts 

 &gt; into random love scenes - so this part can be multi-megabit/s. After 

 &gt; this the bitrate would dramatically decrease again as the last few 

 &gt; seconds will just show &quot;Summer 2010&quot;. &gt;




&gt;<i> Does QuickTime also handle such content gracefully (e.g. display a 
</I>
 &gt; position slider that doesn't jump around wildly)? Am I overestimating 

 &gt; the problem?

 

&gt;<i> Maik
</I>

The slider should just indicate a relative position (i.e. a percentage)
between 0 and the (currently known) duration of the content, which may be
estimated with a variable average time, perhaps retarded at the beginning,
and varied according to the bitrate variation with some euristic, to make
the computation more accurate (or maybe a few consecutive evaluation, at
fixed and rapid intervals, could be averaged to get a better value, before
updating anything), so no &quot;crazy horse jumping&quot; should happen. Silvia
Pfeiffer has proposed a 'length' attribute to indicate the overall duration
in the markup, and I think its value could help to improve accuracy, even
when wrong.
