<PRE>
On the basis that the data template and repetition block template sections 
didn't actually solve enough problems, I've dropped them from the spec.

If there are specific features we could add that would make it easier to 
implement custom templating features, please do let me know. It seems 
almost everyone with needs for templating has different specific needs, so 
it would be better for us to provide a generic API for custom templating 
features instead.

The feedback below is thus being dropped at this point, as it no longer 
applies to the spec. Thanks for the feedback anyway!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the remove button, this displays the correct button for IE 5 and 6.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!--[if IE 1]&gt;--&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;remove&quot; name=&quot;remove&quot; value=&quot;[player]&quot;&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>     Remove&lt;/button&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: This: &lt;!--[if IE 1]&gt;--&gt;...&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt; is a validating version of
</I>&gt;<i> the so-called &quot;downlevel-revealed&quot; conditional comment:
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;![if expression]&gt; HTML &lt;![endif]&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> (which should probaby be nick-named &quot;uplevel-revealed&quot; :-)).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the add button, this code works as intended, but still buggy like remove
</I>&gt;<i> is (as I will explain later):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!--[if IE 1]&gt;--&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;add&quot; name=&quot;add&quot; value=&quot;add&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     Add Player&lt;/button&gt;&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;add&quot; value=&quot;add&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     Add Player&lt;/button&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, the problem with the solution is that IE still sends the name/value pair
</I>&gt;<i> for both the add and remove button regardless of which one was clicked (ie.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;successful&quot;) and sends the button label as the value, rather than the value
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.  This can be seen by looking at the resultant query string from the
</I>&gt;<i> submission:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...&amp;remove=Remove+IE&amp;add=Add+Player+%28IE%29
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to works as intended for the add button because the add name/value
</I>&gt;<i> pair must be detected and used in the server-side script, before the remove.
</I>&gt;<i> So, it ends up adding a field regardless of which button was pressed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only solution I could think of was to change the &lt;button&gt;s to &lt;input&gt;s,
</I>&gt;<i> however the buttons would then be labeled with the text from the value
</I>&gt;<i> attribute (ie. &quot;[player]&quot; and &quot;add&quot; for remove and add buttons, respectively).
</I>&gt;<i> And changing that value attribute, at least for the remove button, would stop
</I>&gt;<i> server-side script form working correctly to remove the correct fields.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, for anyone wondering how this solution would work after IE7 is
</I>&gt;<i> released, and if IE fixes their &lt;button&gt; implementation, then the conditonal
</I>&gt;<i> comments can be altered as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Change: &lt;!--[if IE 1]&gt;--&gt; To: &lt;!--[if IE 7]&gt;&lt;!-- -- --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Change: &lt;!--[if IE]&gt;      To: &lt;!--[if lt IE 7]&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, even without these alterations the IE 5/6 version of the buttons
</I>&gt;<i> should still work in IE7 anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without the special &lt;!-- -- --&gt; pseudo-comment [1], IE7 would end up
</I>&gt;<i> outputting the &quot;--&gt;&quot; from the original &quot;if IE 1&quot; version.  The 3
</I>&gt;<i> double-hyphens &quot;--&quot; ensures that the enitire comment remains valid in SGML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] I called it a pseudo comment because it's not really a full comment in

</I>&gt;<i> I am also very interested in this question. I think there is a tendency 
</I>&gt;<i> to include too much in HTML - &quot;since that what developers know&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except for the case of repeating stuff on a multi-line form (already 
</I>&gt;<i> covered in Web forms 2) I have never felt the need for any client side 
</I>&gt;<i> template system, nor have I read of any app where this might be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, will they degrade gracefully?

Cheers,
