This isn't a label replacement really. The only time that I can think of 
where omitting the label might work is for the type=search idea, if we add 
it, since then the shape of the field is self-explanatory. But that would 
be true regardless of placeholder=&quot;&quot;'s existence.

alt=&quot;&quot; is about not dispaying images, it has nothing to do with 
placeholder values. I think it would be highly confusing to mix the two 
cases here.

We can't really change the behavior of title=&quot;&quot; now, it'd have all kinds

I've made it (in the spec) apply to types text, email, url, and password.

I've defined it so that it does.

I don't see any harm to having this in the language really. We don't 
disallow UAs from rendering this after the control.

I've not made it apply to &lt;select&gt;, though it's an interesting idea. I'll
