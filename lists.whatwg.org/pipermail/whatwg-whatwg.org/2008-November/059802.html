</I>
Hm, this is indeed a problem.


&gt;<i> I can imagine a few ways to avoid this problem:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  1) Don't write any pages with XSS holes.
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Detect tampering by refusing to submit login details if &gt;= 2 forms
</I>&gt;<i> match the name.
</I>&gt;<i>  3) Only submit login details to same-origin URLs, or to some other
</I>&gt;<i> restricted set.
</I>&gt;<i>  4) Configure the crawler with the form submission URL, as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> form field names and values, so it doesn't have to trust the HTML.
</I>&gt;<i>  5) Change WWW-Authenticate so it gives all the details (submission
</I>&gt;<i> URL, field names, etc), so nobody has to trust the HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But (1) is not going to happen in reality, so we should try to minimise 
</I>&gt;<i> the damage when XSS holes exist. (2) won't work because the attacker 
</I>&gt;<i> could write '...?xsshole=...&lt;!--' and the second form would be hidden. 
</I>&gt;<i> (3) is more sensible; perhaps the spec should explicitly note that you 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be quite careful about not submitting login forms to third-party 
</I>&gt;<i> sites unless you're sure you trust them?
</I>
(3) won't work anyway, since sometimes the login form is cross-domain on 
purpose (e.g. OpenID).


&gt;<i> But even with (3), I could write &lt;a
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;/restricted-access.php?xsshole=&lt;form
</I>&gt;<i> action=/public-pastebin.php&gt;...&quot;&gt; and the crawler would send the login
</I>&gt;<i> details to somewhere on the same host where I could still read them
</I>&gt;<i> back, which doesn't seem great.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So (4) is more sensible. You already have to configure the crawler
</I>&gt;<i> with the form field names, so you might as well tell it what URL to
</I>&gt;<i> submit to, and it shouldn't parse the HTML response or care about the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;form&gt; element. (Then there's no need for WWW-Authenticate to even say
</I>&gt;<i> what the form name is.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (5) is basically the same, except it's late-binding the form details 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than hardcoding them into the crawler's configuration, and so it 
</I>&gt;<i> makes it easy to change the server-side login handling without 
</I>&gt;<i> reconfiguring everyone's crawlers.
</I>
If we want to go with (4) or (5) then there is no need for this to be 
bound to an HTML form anymore, and we should remove it from the spec.

Is there anyone who can volunteer to edit this section as a separate spec?

I guess I'll remove this section.
