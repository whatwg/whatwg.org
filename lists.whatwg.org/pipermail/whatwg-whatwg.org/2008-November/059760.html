No, I understand. That was not the point I was making. I mean it the other 
way around.
I am *not* saying that the second example (44BC) should be able to be 
marked-up like this, but that -because we can't mark that one up- neither 
shoudl we mark up the second example. In other words the spec should be 
clear on the fact that it is not intended for this kind of use either.
Perhaps it should be more of a &quot;time-stamp&quot;? (like the address-element is 
actually only used for the author of the article/page/site so this element 
is like that?)

I hope I make myself clear?
