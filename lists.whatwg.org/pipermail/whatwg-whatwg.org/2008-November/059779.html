There's a question at the bottom about how best to make transactions be 
free of concurrency problems. Input welcome.

I agree that this might be a problem. I'm not sure how to address it.

I don't want to add this yet, in case it turns out we don't really need 
it, but implementation experience will definitely tell us whether this is 
needed or not and if it is we will have to add it in v2.

Fixed.

Yeah, that's a bit confusing. Not sure what to do about it.

What's the use case? Can we wait until v2 to add this, or is it critical?

I am loath to do this, because of the performance hit. However, what we 
could do is say that if the first statement is read-only, they all have to 
be, and if the first statement is a write, then it locks the database? 
Though that would be rather weird...

We could have a .writeTransaction() and a .readTransaction(), where the 
former always run in isolation.

Any preferences?
