I agree with Samuel in that this is an issue. In Catalunya, most often
Spanish software is used (both OS and browsers), because a lot of the
software is not easily (or at all) available in Catalan (specially
Microsoft software, such as Windows and IE, which ammount for a quite
big fraction of web surfers). Seeing Spanish stuff in pages that are
supposed to be in Catalan is quite annoying (especially when keeping
in mind some historic factors).

I can understand that there may be some security concerns with this
control; but I don't think changing the &quot;Browse&quot; caption poses any
threat. But if there is so much paranoia on this, browsers could be
allowed (or even required) to ask for confirmation when picking a file
if the caption has been changed (something like &quot;Are you sure you
would like to submit C:\example.txt to example.com?&quot; should be enough,
and users would easily see such question as comming from the UA rather
than from the webpage).
