&gt;<i> I had my doubts when I heard browser vendors were going to do the next 
</I>&gt;<i> standard. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt, I had high hopes as 
</I>&gt;<i> well. I read both the X/HTML5 and the XHTML2 spec over the past two months, 
</I>&gt;<i> and if I was given a choice (but that is personal ofcourse) I would choose 
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML2 without a second thought.
</I>XHTML2 has some points going for it, for example the &lt;h&gt; element,
removal of legacy elements or the &quot;any object can be a link&quot; @href
attribute. However, it has it inconsistencies, too - I would be careful
with attributing that to the makers of the spec. Fact: (X)HTML5 at least
seems to have a more open process and that means: You can probably work
on it.

&gt;<i> The X/HTML spec reads too much like a law and leave little or no room for the creative 
</I>&gt;<i> designer minds that eventually need to work with it.
</I>Creative designer minds working on rendering engines and DOM
properties ? Sorry, but one &quot;creative&quot; vendor (MS) apparently is enough
to throw the web off balance ... and no reasonable sane person wants to
repeat that.

&gt;<i> I am slowely but seriously contemplating organising the designer world and 
</I>&gt;<i> creating our own standards. these browsers have been nothing but troubles 
</I>&gt;<i> since the first day of the internet.
</I>Wait, what ?

&gt;<i> First a &quot;war&quot;, then it was slow and bad 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of standards, and now it is creating a new standard which is 
</I>&gt;<i> unusable in a practical sense for designers.(and it won't guarantee anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> that it will mean all browsers will be standards compliant, so what is the 
</I>&gt;<i> point?)
</I>Yeah, what's the point of standards if one can just ignore them ? Maybe
heavily armed web mercenaries tort^H^H^H^H^H easing the vendors into
compliance would be a better way to go ?

&gt;<i> As a designer all I want is a standard that enables me to design and 
</I>&gt;<i> to comply to usability, accessibility etc. without having to worry about UAs 
</I>&gt;<i> breaking or doing things differently just because someone thought: &quot;wow, 
</I>&gt;<i> look we can do that...how gimmicky. Let us implement it&quot;.
</I>Then go burn Redmond. Send cash to Opera. Or Mozilla. Wait, Google does
the last thing already. Seriously, bother someone else.

&gt;<i> Browser vendors should equally comply to standards and simply make browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> user friendly. Neither designers nor UA manufacturers have any business of 
</I>&gt;<i> writing specs!
</I>Separation of powers, eh ? I'm gonna make my own web standard, with
hookers and blackjack ! In fact, forget the web standard ...

&gt;<i> Well, sorry for the rant, but this is just another sad example I think of 
</I>&gt;<i> free market and free speech being abused.
</I>Thing is, we have nearly infinite resources on the web. Go make your
standard. The only concept I know of that has &quot;abusing free speech&quot; is
using free speech to abolish it (e.g. [GODWIN DETECTED]).


Now GTFO my web,
