It sounds to me like simply saying:

setTimout(handler, ms):
   When called will schedule a event 'ms' milliseconds after the function
   is called. When the event fires 'handler' is called.

would make it a bug to not fire the event and produce any side effects 
that it would have. For exactly the same reasons that canceling a 
pending XHR request would be a bug.

(The above is obviously a far simplification of setTimeout)
