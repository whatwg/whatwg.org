Like I said, I completely understand the issues here. It just seems a bit 
strange to me to choose one specific calendar and promote that one to 
&quot;exact&quot;. thereby not only limiting the use of the time-element in regard to 
*any* time/date but even within its own calendrical base (1582 as you 
correctly point out, but also to any leap-stuff that came after it).
I still think it would be better to simply let go of the &quot;we want the 
time/date to be exact (in relation to our current calendar/clocks)&quot; and use 
a more relative construct. But only because I find it illogical from a 
semantical point of view. I can accept the technical limitations. So I will 
concede ;-)
in the end it is up to the author to use this element and I strongly suspect 
it will be misused and abused because of it's illogical limitations (this is 
no critisism, just an observation of the element itself)
