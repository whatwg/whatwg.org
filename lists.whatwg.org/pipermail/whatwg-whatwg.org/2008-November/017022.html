Strictly speaking, does it matter for the DOM or parser or whatever, if a 
tag is named and used like: &lt;abbr title=&quot;description&quot;&gt;someword&lt;/abbr&gt; or 
like this:
&lt;reference class=&quot;abbreviation&quot; ttle=&quot;some 
description&quot;&gt;someword&lt;/reference&gt;.
I don't see how that would make things technically different?
The same applies for the difference in (for example) &lt;code&gt;blabla&lt;/code&gt; or 
&lt;p class=code&gt;blabla&lt;/p&gt;.

Obviously there are constructs thinkable where the two would indeed at least 
rub shoulders like for example in nesting headers, but I am sure something 
like that is not a major issue and would only mean the two specs need to 
come to agreement with somethings like that.
Another example (just a thought, don't take it seriously) What if we 
eliminate headers alltogether and specify that the title attribute of a 
section is the header. Now, in that case I agree one should colaborate with 
the technical department. But in the grand scheme of things, those are minor 
points surely?
