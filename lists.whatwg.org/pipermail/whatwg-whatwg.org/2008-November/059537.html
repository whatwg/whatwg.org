<PRE>I should point out that the pixelratio attribute isn't only for authors,
it's also useful when the media framework used doesn't recognize the
(pixel) aspect ratio even when it's correctly set. From reading the
mplayer man page I see that AVI files can have aspect ratio set in the
OpenDML vprp header, but I doubt e.g. DirectShow supports this (I could
be wrong though).

I don't feel very strongly about the attribute either way, but given
that video is scaled to fit inside its element box with aspect preserved
and not simply stretched then an incorrectly parsed/guessed aspect ratio
would make a big difference. This seems very similar to the width/height
attributes of an image and that usually isn't considered an ugly hack.
If the pixelratio attribute is removed then I would suggest also
removing the involvement of aspect ratio over the size of the element.

By the way, the &quot;pixel-aspect-ratio&quot; on video caps in the GStreamer
framework has precisely the same meaning as this attribute, overriding
it on a video sink also has an effect similar to what is suggested in
the HTML5 spec. In other words, it's not so outlanding from a media
framework's point of view.

Oh, and if the video also needs cropping to get the correct aperture,
couldn't this be done with CSS perhaps?
