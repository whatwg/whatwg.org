</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you sure? If you don't clip it, you still get the right shape

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because you didn't crop, but so what? We're just trying to do a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last-ditch aspect ratio fix here, not get perfect video.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the pixels will look right if you pass 10:11, but not the overall

</I>&gt;<i> aspect ratio to end up with 640x480 (the very nice 0.888888888888889)...
</I>
Anyone who's using this attribute has long given up on getting perfect 
output; they just want to have circles look like circles.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Pixel aspect ratio has a precise meaning in the video world, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; using it outside of clean aperture does not make a lot of sense...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I can tell, using it outside clean aperture works fine so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long as you don't also expect the final output to be the &quot;right&quot; video 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; size.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're effectively saying that it works *fine* as long as you we don't 
</I>&gt;<i> expect to work *right*. I have to admit, this is a concept that escapes 
</I>&gt;<i> me ;)
</I>
We're dealing with videos that are mis-encoded here, by definition (that's 
what the attribute is for). The biggest problem with misencoded videos is 
the ratio. The goal here is just to provide a way to hack the ratio to be 
right so that at least the biggest mistake is fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If we start going in this direction, then &lt;img&gt; should have a &quot;dpi&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; attribute so you can &quot;hack&quot; around images uploaded at dpi &gt; 72 ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We effectively do, it's the &quot;height&quot; (or &quot;width&quot;) attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly my point: now replace, &lt;img&gt; by &lt;video&gt;, &quot;dpi&quot; by &quot;aspectRatio&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> and add a new boolean attribute to the video tag, so you can do 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fillToFit&quot; instead of &quot;scaleToFit&quot; and you have a real solution that 
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to resize the video the way you want and avoids half-baked 
</I>&gt;<i> concepts like &quot;it's pixel aspect ratio, but actually not really, and you 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be using it anyway&quot;.
</I>
I don't understand why that would be better. If we did this, then there'd 
be no way to have a consistent playback area across multiple pages and fix 
the ratio of busted clips. You'd be forced to change the layout, which is 
hardly a &quot;quick fix&quot;.


&gt;<i> I might be missing something here, but:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I don't remember any major media system I've dealt with so far having 
</I>&gt;<i> an explicit pixel aspect ratio override API,
</I>&gt;<i> 2) on the web, neither QT plug-in nor Flash have it,
</I>
That might explain the large number of videos on the Web that are rendered 
at the wrong ratio without anyone doing anything about it. :-)


&gt;<i> 3) in the case of this spec, the way it's defined makes it behave 
</I>&gt;<i> incorrectly
</I>
It doesn't support the clean aperture concept, and doesn't crop anything, 
certainly, but does it lead to the wrong ratio?


&gt;<i> 4) it's not straightforward to use (see very first reply above)
</I>
I'm open to better ideas.


&gt;<i> 5) there's no _actual_ data that proves it's necessary (shouldn't the 
</I>&gt;<i> software or video web site fix the videos upfront?)
</I>
Anecdotally, I see this quite a lot (several times a week).


&gt;<i> Based on this, it seems to me this attribute should not be in the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> by default, and we should switch the burden of the proof to people who 
</I>&gt;<i> want it (rather than it being on people who don't want it as it seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> be the case today), and finally wait to see 1) if there's a real need 
</I>&gt;<i> for a solution here and 2) if the best solution is indeed a pixel aspect 
</I>&gt;<i> ratio override.
</I>
I'm certainly open to other solutions. What do you suggest?

I don't understand why this attribute would cause problems. Can you 
elaborate?

</I>&gt;<i> I should point out that the pixelratio attribute isn't only for authors,

</I>&gt;<i> (pixel) aspect ratio even when it's correctly set. From reading the 
</I>&gt;<i> mplayer man page I see that AVI files can have aspect ratio set in the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenDML vprp header, but I doubt e.g. DirectShow supports this (I could 
</I>&gt;<i> be wrong though).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't feel very strongly about the attribute either way, but given 
</I>&gt;<i> that video is scaled to fit inside its element box with aspect preserved 
</I>&gt;<i> and not simply stretched then an incorrectly parsed/guessed aspect ratio 
</I>&gt;<i> would make a big difference. This seems very similar to the width/height 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes of an image and that usually isn't considered an ugly hack. 
</I>&gt;<i> If the pixelratio attribute is removed then I would suggest also 
</I>&gt;<i> removing the involvement of aspect ratio over the size of the element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, the &quot;pixel-aspect-ratio&quot; on video caps in the GStreamer 
</I>&gt;<i> framework has precisely the same meaning as this attribute, overriding 
</I>&gt;<i> it on a video sink also has an effect similar to what is suggested in 
</I>&gt;<i> the HTML5 spec. In other words, it's not so outlanding from a media 
</I>&gt;<i> framework's point of view.
</I>
Indeed.

Because a video file having the wrong ratio is far more annoying than a 
video file having the wrong Genre.


&gt;<i> Another obvious over-ride, which I think also comes up more often, is 
</I>&gt;<i> when the source doesn't tag its color space correctly (&quot;It was designed

</I>
This is far less of a problem than the wrong ratio, IMHO.

(Also, people's screens are likely to have gamma, brightness, and contrast 
settings far more out of wack than the difference that a gamma override 
would make.)

I have received feedback from YouTube developers who have commented 
positively on this feature, but I believe the feature was there before 
they commented on it. I don't believe YouTube has anything like this yet. 
(Can you stretch video in Flash?)
