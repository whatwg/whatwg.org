(Note: feedback relating to drag-and-drop of files from the filesystem, 
with possible uploading of content, isn't included in this e-mail. I am 
waiting to see what happens with the Web Apps File Upload spec.)

</I>
There isn't, but isn't the cursor moved to the drop target position 
automatically in most systems? And in systems where that doesn't happen, 
shouldn't the drop happen where the cursor is anyway?

</I>
No. If you really wanted to create your own DragEvent object, you'd have 
to &quot;fake&quot; a DataTransfer object using a JS object that happened to 
implement all the right attributes and methods.


&gt;<i> IE and Safari allow a no-argument form of clearData as well which clears

Added.


&gt;<i> The description for the 'types' property implies that this should be a

</I>
Why not?


&gt;<i> The clearData, setData and getData methods should clarify what happens 
</I>&gt;<i> if an empty format is supplied.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> I still don't understand the purpose of the addElement method. Either 
</I>&gt;<i> this should be removed or there should be clarification of the 
</I>&gt;<i> difference between addElement and setDragImage
</I>
Added a note.


&gt;<i> Previously, I said that DragEvents should be UIEvents. I think they 
</I>&gt;<i> should instead inherit from MouseEvent.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> We have a need to be able to support both dragging multiple items, as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as dragging non-string data, for instance dragging a set of files 
</I>&gt;<i> as a set of File objects (see <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/">http://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/</A>) from 
</I>&gt;<i> the file system onto a page.
</I>
Agreed, but I haven't added anything for files yet because I'm waiting for 
that spec to stabilise.

It would be useful to have a clearer description of use cases for this 
kind of thing. When would an app be dragging a mixed bag of stuff like 
this? (That aren't all files, and that can't all be described together as 
a single piece of data with a single type.)

Isn't that just dragging the handle?
