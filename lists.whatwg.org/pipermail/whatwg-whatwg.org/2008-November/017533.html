</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; USA, LLC.&quot; and wonder what's going on!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There's no way to tell which is which without heuristical analysis 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the language, so the UA can't auto-expand based on a single 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; previous occurrence, which I think is the behaviour you were 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; expecting by disallowing abbrs without titles and removing the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; referencing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't expect any autoexpading at all. Ever, even with &lt;abbr&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present with a title=&quot;&quot; attribute. Why would one want that? That would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be really annoying. We have acronyms and abbreviations for a reason -- 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to make things shorter! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People with learning disabilities, the elderly or people unfamiliar with 
</I>&gt;<i> certain jargon may prefer to have certain, or even all, abbreviations 
</I>&gt;<i> display in their expanded form by default. I know I can never remember 
</I>&gt;<i> what all the US state codes are, for example.
</I>
I still wouldn't expect title-free &lt;abbr&gt;s to expand by default, for the 
very reason described above.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a) Documents will either mark up every acronym with an &lt;abbr title=&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; tag&#8212;user agents that expand these by default (primarily aural as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand it) will appear very verbose&#8212;or,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; User agents that expand abbreviations by default are poor, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are certain options to expand abbreviations in place of the 
</I>&gt;<i> abbreviated form in both JAWS and Window-Eyes screen readers, but this 
</I>&gt;<i> is not default behaviour in either case.
</I>
That seems reasonable.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; b) Documents will only mark up the first occurrence. UAs that do not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; process subsequent occurrences of the abbreviation (currently all of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; them), will suffer from lack of definitions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't follow this. Why would documents only mark up the first one?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the confusion here is that current best practice is to only mark 
</I>&gt;<i> up the first abbreviation in a page with the expansion to avoid verbose 
</I>&gt;<i> output to users. To all intents and purposes, such advice should be 
</I>&gt;<i> ignored for reasons already identified to the list (i.e. you can't know 
</I>&gt;<i> a user's entry point into a document). However, it *could* be a 
</I>&gt;<i> preference in software to only expand the first occurence thus putting 
</I>&gt;<i> control back into the hands of the user. The problem that remains is how 
</I>&gt;<i> to disambiguate abbreviations that have more than one expanded form.
</I>
Authors should use the title=&quot;&quot; attribute to include the expansion if they 
want their pages to be clear.


&gt;<i> In my opinion, a more useful solution is to offer some form of 
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure for glossaries where abbreviations can be uniquely 
</I>&gt;<i> identified to an expanded form. This would aid disambiguation and give 
</I>&gt;<i> control of rendering to users via their user agent.
</I>
I don't see why just having the title=&quot;&quot; attribute isn't enough.


I've added a note to the spec that says that authors shouldn't expect a UA 
to expand abbreviations just based on earlier &lt;abbr&gt; elements with the 
same contents.
