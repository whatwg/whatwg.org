<PRE>More random issues related to HTMLMediaElement

<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#dom-media-buffered">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#dom-media-buffered</A>

&quot;The buffered attribute must return a static normalized TimeRanges object&quot;

The phrasing for the other ranges attributes is similar, but what does
&quot;static&quot; mean in this context. I'm guessing that it means static in the
sense that the same object is returned each time. As a consequence you
can't keep a copy of an old ranges object to compare it with a new one
later. This is all very fine, I just want to verify that it's correct.

<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#potentially-playing">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#potentially-playing</A>

&quot;A media element is said to be potentially playing when its paused
attribute is false, the readyState attribute is either HAVE_FUTURE_DATA
or HAVE_FUTURE_DATA, the element has not ended playback, playback has
not stopped due to errors, and the element has not paused for user
interaction.&quot;

There's a typo here with two HAVE_FUTURE_DATA. I'm not sure what the
intention was, but it seems to me that readyState shouldn't be involved
here. Consider:

new Audio(&quot;foo.wav&quot;).play();

&quot;Media elements that are potentially playing while not in a Document
must not play any video, but should play any audio component. Media
elements must not stop playing just because all references to them have
been removed...&quot;

Immediately after the above call has returned, the readyState of the
media element is HAVE_NOTHING unless the resource happened to be
cached. The definition of &quot;potentially playing&quot; must be such that this
object isn't immediately garbage collected. Suggested definition:

&quot;A media element is said to be potentially playing when its paused
attribute is false, the element has not ended playback, playback has
not stopped due to errors.&quot;

In other words, remove the readyState and &quot;paused for user interaction&quot;
stuff (surely a media element could potentially keep playing after such
user interaction, otherwise there would be no need to ask).

(Also, I'm still wondering about the issues in my previous mail.)
