Indeed.

Hmm.. this makes a lot of sense for importScripts, but for XHR you 
probably want the baseURI to be that of the opening page, since it's 
quite likely that the opening page gave you a URI to open and process.

Of course that would be quite confusing (different baseURIs for 
different APIs), as well as impossible for shared workers as they don't 
have a single document as opener.

What we need is an API for resolving relative URIs, that way scripts can 
at least do the resolving manually. We could also add an API for getting 
the baseURI of the document on the other side of a port (should possibly 
live on the message event).
