I agree with Anne here. I've left the spec as is.

Note that the whole point here is to discourage people from using the 
attribute. Also, it is intended only for use by people who are trying to 
fix a broken video; they might not know the right value, so it doesn't 
really matter so much whether the value that is used is precise or not, 
just so long as it improves the video relative to what it would be if the 
value in the video data file itself was assumed.

The whole point here is that the video is wrong, and the author is trying 
to apply a last-minute hack to improve it a bit. If performance is an 
issue, then encode the video correctly and don't use the attribute at all.

The whole point is to discourage authors from using it, so actually we 
sort of _want_ it to not help authoring. :-)

Assume that we have a video that is 10000 video pixels square. That's a 
100 megapixel video.

If we pretend that aspect ratio of the pixels is 11:11, then the video 
will, at 1:1 zoom, take 10000 horizontal pixels (and 10000 vertical 
pixels).

If we assume that the pixel ratio is 10:11 = 0.9090909090909090909090909, 
and we keep the vertical number of pixels at 10000, then it will be 
(rounding to 0dp) 9091 pixels wide. If we assume that the pixel ratio is 
just 10:11 = 0.90909 then it will STILL be (rounding to 0dp) 9091 pixels 
wide. In practice, videos are much smaller and displayed on much smaller 
displays. So, with all due respect, why is it not enough?


&gt;<i> Although the difference may seem negligible, simple image scaling 
</I>&gt;<i> algorythms tend to yield horribel results for slight scaling (you can 
</I>&gt;<i> try to render a PDF document at 101% zoom to see what I'm speaking 
</I>&gt;<i> about; especially one with images). The alternative, bilinear or 
</I>&gt;<i> trilinear scaling, could be too much of a strain for video: there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> higly noticeable difference between running such algorythm once and 
</I>&gt;<i> running it 25 or 30 times each second. If we add to the mix that pages 
</I>&gt;<i> might be including several videos; that most probably there is also 
</I>&gt;<i> audio playing along with the video, the computation cost of decoding, 
</I>&gt;<i> and the fact that not every user on the web (probably, not even the 
</I>&gt;<i> majority of them) uses a high end computer; then scaling needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> quick and simple enough to achieve decent rendering without mass-frying 
</I>&gt;<i> CPUs.
</I>
Scaling a video to 9090 pixels wide or 9091 pixels wide isn't going to 
show the artifacts you are talking about.


&gt;<i> I still don't understand why the spec has to define each and every 
</I>&gt;<i> parser algorythm (IMO, it should only define the syntax, and then the 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation should define its own algorythm that parses that syntax 
</I>&gt;<i> as defined)
</I>
We have to define the parsers because the syntax alone doesn't define the 
error handling behavior.


&gt;<i> but if that's the issue then a microsyntax can be perfectly avoided by 
</I>&gt;<i> splitting the argument into two separate ones, such as pixelratiox and 
</I>&gt;<i> pixelratioy.
</I>
We want to make this as cheap as possible, and adding more attributes 
doesn't make it cheaper.

For example, having two attributes introduces costs such as:

Going back to the original topic:

Agreed.

I think you may misunderstand what the attribute is for. It's only 
intended as an override for broken video files that don't have the correct 
pixel aspect ratio in the first place.

</I>
This is intended to be a quick fix attribute for cases where the video is 
under someone else's control, e.g. if a blog wants to embed a YouTube 
video file that has the wrong ratio.

</I>
For the videos we're talking about, just getting near the right ratio is 
probably all we can ask for -- we're not talking about professional video 
data here. We're talking misencoded YouTube videos where an embedder wants 
to fix the most egregious error before showing his friends the cat jumping 
off the side of the pool or something.

I agree that this is just a hack attribute, and I agree that it isn't 
going to be widely used. But I think it will be used enough to justify its 
existence. There are a surprisingly large number of misencoded videos on 
the Web, and plenty of people who care.

Ideally it would; this is just intended for the case where it failed.
