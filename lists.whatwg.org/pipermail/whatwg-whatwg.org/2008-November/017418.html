</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, as you write and as HTML5 defines it, there is nothing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong with &lt;small&gt; per se, and I agree that as an element indicating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;smallprint&quot;, it works just fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since my initial reply might have been a bit too colored by the HTML4  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition of the element and its current usage on the web, I hereby  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; withdraw my comment and conclude that I mostly agree with you. :-)
</I>
Yay, consensus!  Thanks, Asbj&#248;rn.

&gt;<i> But isn't this just the reason why it should be dis-used?  The HTML4
</I>&gt;<i> spec defined it as a styling tag, and that is how it is *mostly* used
</I>&gt;<i> and understood by the majority of the users/authors.
</I>
That may be true (though authors who want smaller text just because they
think the default looks too large could also use &lt;font size=2&gt; or CSS),
but authors who wanted to diminished the emphasis of certain content to
users are likely to pick &lt;small&gt; because there isn't much else
available.

Just because an element is currently widely used for a purpose we deem
inappropriate doesn't mean that its appropriate uses aren't important.
Tables are widely used for layout; &lt;br&gt;-s are widely misused.  Both of
those clearly have other valid uses, so are still in HTML.

&gt;<i> Just because HTML5 redefines the element does not mean that the
</I>&gt;<i> element will suddenly be semantic. Even if people start using it
</I>&gt;<i> purely semantically from now on (and what is the chance of that?), the
</I>&gt;<i> existing websites still carry small-tags that are not compliant with
</I>&gt;<i> the new definition.
</I>
Yes.  But the suggested alternative was to deprecate &lt;small&gt; entirely
and invent a new element to convey the semantic of 'small print'.  That
would of course make _all_ current uses of &lt;small&gt; non-conforming.
Presentational &lt;small&gt;-s are going to be non-conforming either way;
allowing semantic &lt;small&gt;-s to conform doesn't change that.

&gt;<i> By redefining it the (existing) web &quot;breaks&quot;; allbeit purely in the
</I>&gt;<i> semantic area. 
</I>
That's intentional.  If anybody checks legacy content against the new
standard they will discover that what they did is no longer recommended.
However, browsers will 100% support it and continue to render it as it
always has been, so the 'breakage' is no way visible; if the author
chooses not to care about it then no harm is done.

PS: Pentasis, please could you send mails that do at least one of
attributing who you're quoting or include In-Reply-To: headers so that
they continue the existing thread rather than starting a new one.
Without either it's rather tedious to have to look up who said the text
you quote.  Thanks.
