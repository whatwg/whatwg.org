I was asking, obviously, what use is a default value if you can't edit 
it. If an enabled text field had a displayed value= but the value was 
not actually editable, that would be unpleasantly surprising.

That problem applies just as much to &lt;input placeholder=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; as it 
would have done to &lt;input value=&quot;foo&quot; clearonfocus&gt;: depending on 
whether the placeholder text is greyed out, it would make the field 
either look like it has a value when it actually doesn't, or look 
disabled when it actually isn't. It would also hide the label or hint 
for the field for *precisely* the period when you need it most. I'm not 
aware of any possible presentation that avoids both (or even one of!) 
those problems, and previously HTML5 has shied away from expecting 
browsers to implement things that have no known reasonable 
presentation.

I appreciate that Web authors currently go to some scripting lengths to 
position labels for text fields inside the fields, and I think it's 
quite appropriate that they should have to go to those lengths, because 
it makes bad design more difficult. I would rather see, as I've 
previously suggested, markup for associating form controls with hints 
outside them in a similar way as labels can be associated now.

But they couldn't really do that, it'd have all kinds of weird 
unexpected effects on pages designed by people using browsers that 
present it the way the spec suggests.
