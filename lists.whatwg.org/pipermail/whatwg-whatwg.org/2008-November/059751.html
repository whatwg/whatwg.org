<PRE>
I include below a number of e-mails sent on the topic of Geolocation and 
possible things we should add to HTML5 around this. I haven't added 
anything, because I the W3C's Geolocation group is already working on 
providing an API for this. I encourage people who want to work on this 
topic to join that group:

   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2008/geolocation/">http://www.w3.org/2008/geolocation/</A>

I didn't see anything in the feedback below that hasn't already been more 
or less said in the context of that group, so this time I haven't 
forwarded the feedback to the other group as I usually do.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And the other document is a proposed charter for a new Working Group:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2006/10/uwa-charter.html">http://www.w3.org/2006/10/uwa-charter.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially you might want to look at the &quot;Leverage the DCI for
</I>&gt;<i> work on enabling use of device capabilities, remote eventing and
</I>&gt;<i> device coordination&quot; section of the charter:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2006/10/uwa-charter.html#dci">http://www.w3.org/2006/10/uwa-charter.html#dci</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And within that, the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Enabling use of Device Capabilities
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2006/10/uwa-charter.html#device-capabilities">http://www.w3.org/2006/10/uwa-charter.html#device-capabilities</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The section of the charter outlines this new work can make use of
</I>&gt;<i> previous work that was done at the W3C on the &quot;DCI&quot;, which is
</I>&gt;<i> documented in the following W3C Candidate Recommendation:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Delivery Context: Interfaces (DCI) Accessing Static and Dynamic Properties
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/DPF/">http://www.w3.org/TR/DPF/</A>
</I>
