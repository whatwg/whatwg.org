Granted, but it's not clear how one could do custom validity checking 
without script, and for the other cases there are declarative solutions 
(min=&quot;&quot; and max=&quot;&quot; are self-documenting, for instance; and title=&quot;&quot; can be 
used for pattern=&quot;&quot;'s documentation.)


&gt;<i> Would having some sort of &quot;custom-error-message&quot; attribute hurt that 
</I>&gt;<i> much? (Of course, the name is just an example, and I wouldn't really 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest it). It would simply ignored by current UAs, and not really hard 
</I>&gt;<i> to implement (actually, it'd be trivial compared to implementing 
</I>&gt;<i> reg.exp. parsing).
</I>
It's not clear to me what problem this would solve.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If the UA has scripting disabled, trying to prevent the default 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; action for an invalid event won't work. Too overcome this problem, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; there could be a new attribute which could be called 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 'notifyoninvalid=&quot;true|false&quot;' with a default value of true, for each 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; control, or for the entire form. If the value is false, then the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; wouldn't notify the user in case of invalidity. This could then be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; delegated to some CSS using :invalid;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If scripting is disabled, why would you not want the user notified? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That would be pretty bad UI. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That'd be really useful if validation can be delegated to server-side 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting when no client-side scripting is available.
</I>
You can do that today, just don't use the new constraint attributes.


&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't think such an attribute is needed: a page can be 
</I>&gt;<i> authored with a &quot;catch-all&quot; validation rule for the field, and then the 
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript could update that rule upon the page's loading: if scripts 
</I>&gt;<i> are dissabled, the rule wouldn't be updated and would stay as the 
</I>&gt;<i> catch-all.
</I>
I don't really follow.


&gt;<i> OTOH, I think Joao's idea was more like to relying on visual hints (ie: 
</I>&gt;<i> marking the field as red) on cases where an error message popup would be 
</I>&gt;<i> redundant and annoying. I think that could be more elegantly handled 
</I>&gt;<i> with an empty attribute value for an hipothetical &quot;custom-error-message&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute (which is not the same as an absent attribute).
</I>
I really don't follow this. Maybe some concrete examples showing the 
problem with the current spec solutions would help.
