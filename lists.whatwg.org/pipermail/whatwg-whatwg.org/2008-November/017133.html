Re-reading the conversation, I'm not really sure if I really
understood Joao's issue and proposal correctly; and without him
providing any clarification this doesn't turn any better... And, in
addition, I couldn't have worded my ideas worse than I did. It seems
that I got a &quot;404 Brain not found&quot; while writting that message.

Summarizing, my suggestion (a possible solution for what I thought to
be the main use-case for this) was to *not* include the
validation-related arguments in the markup (or use &quot;catch-all&quot;
placeholders), but instead add them from a script upon the page's
onload event. This way, when scripts are available, the javascript
will do whatever it needs, customize everything, and so on; but when
scripts are disabled or not supported, the client won't do anything,
and all the validation will be delegated to the server (that's what is
called *graceful* degradation, in contrast with &quot;grace-less&quot; stuff
like &quot;&lt;noscript&gt;You have no scripting: your browser sux, get a new
one&lt;/noscript&gt;&quot; :P )

&gt;&gt;<i> OTOH, I think Joao's idea was more like to relying on visual hints (ie:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> marking the field as red) on cases where an error message popup would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redundant and annoying. I think that could be more elegantly handled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with an empty attribute value for an hipothetical &quot;custom-error-message&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute (which is not the same as an absent attribute).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't follow this. Maybe some concrete examples showing the
</I>&gt;<i> problem with the current spec solutions would help.
</I>
The main point is that when a page already handless error-reporting
via CSS (for example, marking valid fields in green and invalid ones
in red), further notifications by the UA are redundant and sometimes
(if they take the form pop-up messages) annoying to the user. The need
would be to disable such messages even when scripts are not available.
I don't really know if there is a way to do that with the current
spec.
Anyway, as long as browsers don't use pop-ups for this kind of
notification, this shouldn't be an issue. Most browsers already
provide pop-up blocking functionality, so I hope they won't add
pop-ups of their own needlessly. In addition, a user that sees a field
becomming red (or marked as &quot;invalid&quot; in some other way) isn't likely
to hit the &quot;submit&quot; button before fixing it, so I don't think this is
too much of an issue anyway. Maybe Joao had something else in mind, or
some specific use-case, but unless he can provide more details, I
think this discussion will lead nowhere.

Greetings,
Eduard Pascual
