Well, at the bottom of this email[1] is the previous list with all the @rel
removed.  This way everyone can easily see the numbers without having to
process the file themselves.

As previously noted, there are 1266 instances of rev=&quot;made&quot; (y'all missed a
few).  (Note also that one of them is rev=&quot;made, publisher&quot;,  which is
impossible together short of AI.)  There are 124 rev=&quot;stylesheet&quot;.  There
are 4 rev=&quot;shortcut icon&quot;, plus a few more obvious typos like
rev=&quot;copyright&quot;, rev=&quot;nofollow&quot;, and rev=&quot;text/css&quot; (1 of each, so 3 total).

The next group is somewhat subjectively wrong, so your own calculations may
lead to some slightly different numbers.  As well, it's possible I'm a few
off in a category, so my numbers may not match up *exactly*.

A few of these are mistakes where the author took the attribute as being
short for &quot;revision&quot;.  There are 3 of these.

There are several being used merely to hold arbitrary data for scripting.
There are 7 of these.

There are many which are for whatever reason holding arbitrary non-scripting
data, which can't be construed as anything but a confusion.  I count 36 of
these.

Another large category are those which are *probably* intended to be @rel,
but the author was confused about how @rel/@rev related and used it
incorrectly.  I count 29 of these.

We also have several which fall into the same category as rev=&quot;made&quot;, where
they are trivially redundant with an obvious @rel.  (I define &quot;trivial&quot; here
as &quot;can be turned into a @rel just by changing the conjugation of the
word&quot;.)  I count 26 of these.  To be specific, the values I'm talking about
here are &quot;owns&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;author&quot;, &quot;designed&quot;, and &quot;powered&quot;.  It's also
possible that some of these actually fall into the previous category.

Finally we come to the ones that I can't otherwise categorize.  I'll just go
ahead and list them directly:
      3 &lt;a rev=&quot;vote-for&quot; ...&gt;
      2 &lt;a rev=&quot;testfield&quot; ...&gt;
      2 &lt;a rev=&quot;footnote&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;link rev=&quot;Subdocument&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;link rev=&quot;self&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;link rev=&quot;replyto&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;link rev=&quot;reply-to&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;link rev=&quot;child&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;a rev=&quot;vote-against&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;a rev=&quot;vote-abstain&quot; ...&gt;
      1 &lt;a rev=&quot;review&quot; ...&gt;

Some of these may fall into a previous category, but it's possible that they
are being used correctly.  Many of these also have a fairly trivial @rel
that would express the same relationship as well.


So, let's discuss the numbers.  There about 1517 instances of @rev (my
numbers add up to 1513, but as I said, there may be some mistakes in my
numbers).  1292 of them are trivially reversible into an @rel.  160 of them
*are* @rel values, but the author either typoed or misunderstood the
@rel/@rev distinction.  46 of them are simply wrong, and don't have anything
to do with the actual uses of @rel/@rev.  15 are possibly correct uses of
@rev which aren't *trivially* reversible (that is, they actually require
some thinking about the relationship to name the opposite relation for use
in @rel).

That makes 85% of the uses trivially reversible, 14% of the uses mistakes,
and 1% of the uses valid and non-trivial to reverse into an @rel relation.
@rev-using links are only 1.2% of the total body of links which use @rel or
@rev.
