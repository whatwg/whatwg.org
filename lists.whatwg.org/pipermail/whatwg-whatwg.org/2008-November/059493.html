I've tried to make it less hidden.

You don't have to fire the event if nobody is listening for it. (Browsers 
likely already have this implementation for mutation events if nothing 
else, so this shouldn't be that difficult to implement.)

The idea of the timeupdate event is actually to lighten the load on the 
user agent while simultaneously making the display more accurate than a 
timer could be.

With polling, the polling will miss key points, e.g. when the playback 
loops, which will result in the UI appearing to lag behind the playback. 
It will also cause higher processing cost while there is no need to send 
updates, e.g. while seeking or waiting for data, times where you really 
don't want extra load.


&gt;<i> Using a timer also allows a script to update at exactly the frequency

</I>
Using a timer also allows them to go too fast. :-)


&gt;<i> Video and audio playback is already extremely CPU intensive, we 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't require the UA to burn extra cycles doing unnecessary work.
</I>
I agree. That was exactly the thinking behind the timeupdate event. It 
allows the UA to determine how fast to update the UI without hurting 
performance. Basically it puts the UA in charge of the performance 
critical aspects instead of hoping that the author will work it out.
