</I>&gt;<i> First: Computers are binary instruments. conveying *something* is not very
</I>&gt;<i> logical seen from a computers point of view. It is not usefull to *me* to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a class to the &lt;i&gt; or any other element, it is usefull to the

</I>&gt;<i> more literal means of semantics.
</I>

If we wish to communicate that level of semantics, yes.  It may not be
useful to us.  If you *really* need some metadata/semantics, @class probably
can't convey it with enough granularity.  Check out the big discussion from
a few months ago about ccRel and RDFa.


&gt;<i> Second: Suppose I want to collect all copyright notices from 1000 websites
</I>&gt;<i> (don't ask me why, I just want to), how am I to do this when they are marked
</I>&gt;<i> up in &lt;small&gt;s? I will definatly end up with a lot of text that has nothing
</I>&gt;<i> to do with copyrights (and probably miss a lot of copyright notices as they
</I>&gt;<i> are marked up differently) Whereas If they were maked up in (for example)
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt; I could retrieve it all based on the class-name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That would be a wonderful perfect world.  I'd like the copyright date as
well, so I can retrieve only things copyrighted in the last ten years.
Assuming that metadata will exist is a fool's errand.  The fact is that if
you are searching for copyright notices, the most efficient way is likely to
just search for the string &quot;copyright&quot; and the (c) symbol.  That'll net you
copyright notices with a high accuracy, and some training on real data can
yield further rules to improve the data-mining accuracy.

While we're hoping for copyright notices to be marked up as &lt;span
class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;, though, why not wish for &lt;small class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;?  If
you're going to be providing metadata, it works the same.  Is it that you
believe people won't provide a special class for copyrights if the &lt;small&gt;
tag already gives them the preferred display?  Do you believe that everyone
will automatically use class=&quot;copyright&quot; to mark up their copyright
notices?  What if they use class=&quot;copyright-notice&quot;?  Or class=&quot;license&quot;?
Or any of a million other distinct possibilities that would destroy any
naive attempt to datamine based on a particular class name?
