As of the recent edits, the WF2 form of not skipping whitespace has been 
adopted.


&gt;<i> * WA 1.0 Vaguer moments in time always allow surrounding white space?
</I>
I revamped the syntax for these. It is now consistent with the others -- 
no spaces in attributes, White_Space allowed around in content.


&gt;<i> Why do WA 1.0 datetime formats for attributes allow space around &quot;T&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple spaces in place of &quot;T&quot; when WF 2.0 only allows &quot;T&quot;? Also, why

</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> Also, the &quot;in content&quot; variant of the Vaguer moments in time algorithm 
</I>&gt;<i> is not stable over time, because Unicode can add more Zs characters.
</I>
Correct.

They use the same as all other times now.

Not banned in HTML5.

The spec is pretty explicit now about what should happen.

The spec allows any year from 0001 up (Gregorian, though).

The spec allows dates from year 0001, so that seems addressed now.

</I>
Why would you use Microformats to mark up a date in BC? What problem does 
it solve?

In practice, if you actually need to mark up dates from before the 
Gregorian calendar (let alone BC) you have to do far more complicated 
things, like saying which country you're talking about, which calendar, 
define your sources and your margin of error, etc. Typically you'll be 
talking about seasons and years, not dates.

This kind of data isn't really machine-usable anyway.

While I could see that maybe one day there'd be a use case for &lt;time&gt; that

calendars in use today before looking at calendars that aren't in use 
anymore. So I'd rather punt this for now.

The idea is that it is the UTC time, it's just that there are a few 
seconds of history here and there that can't be represented.

&quot;UT&quot; isn't a real time system as far as I can tell. Did you mean UT1? Or 
TIA? Both of these are slightly offset from UTC and so the same time would 
mean something different than most people would assume.

UTC is what is used by most people (knowingly or not), so it seems best to 
use that here too.

For JS, DOMTimeStamp is bound to the &quot;Date&quot; object, so the problem you 
mention (being limited to time after the Unix epoch) is not an issue.


&gt;<i> Furthermore, the only words in the specification that would imply a 
</I>&gt;<i> particular length for the second (and therefore the millisecond) are UTC 
</I>&gt;<i> or Coordinated Universal Time. Since 1972 UTC has counted in the second 
</I>&gt;<i> of the International System of Units, that is, the second of atomic 
</I>&gt;<i> clocks. The actual mean solar second is slightly longer. From the time 
</I>&gt;<i> of the proposed HTML 5 epoch until January 1, 2009, atomic time and UTC

</I>&gt;<i> differ by 1.
</I>
No, HTML5 time _is_ UTC time, by definition. It just can't represent a few 
seconds here and there, because the syntax doesn't allow representing the 
leap seconds.


&gt;<i> The choice of epoch matches the epoch for Unix, but otherwise seems 
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenient. The problem of the date attribute failing for some 
</I>&gt;<i> information about living people would suggest choosing an epoch before 
</I>&gt;<i> an living person was born, such as the adoption of the Gregorian 
</I>&gt;<i> Calendar (1582-10-15).
</I>
Actually the Gregorian calendar started in different years in different 
countries, so picking that date would be even more problematic. :-)


&gt;<i> If a date near 1970 really is seen as a desirable date, 1973-01-01 00:00 
</I>&gt;<i> UTC suggests itself, because the use of leap seconds began 1973-01-01 
</I>&gt;<i> 00:00 UTC, so any algorithm that needed to account for the difference 
</I>&gt;<i> between atomic time and UTC would only have to deal with integer 
</I>&gt;<i> differences (even if the algorithm needs to work with values slightly 
</I>&gt;<i> before the epoch).
</I>
I don't really see why any algorithm would have to worry about the 
difference between UTC time and TIA time in an HTML page.


&gt;<i> Considering the inability to represent leap seconds in the time element, 
</I>&gt;<i> it appears to me the only way to write a specification that does not 
</I>&gt;<i> contradict itself is to say that the epoch is 1973-01-01 00:00 UT1, not 
</I>&gt;<i> UTC, and that the times represented are UT1 times, not UTC.
</I>
If we did that, then if someone gave an exact time, they would in fact be 
giving a time a few seconds away from what they thought they were giving. 
This is quite a problem, IMHO.


&gt;<i> Thus the unit of measure for the attributes would be seconds of mean 
</I>&gt;<i> solar time as measured by UT1, not seconds as kept by atomic clocks.

</I>
UT1 doesn't use SI seconds (it is literally affected by the rotation of 
the moon and other celestial effects, which would mean that its use could 
literally lead to bugs that depend on the phase of the moon), which makes 
its use in computers rather problematic.
