<PRE>
Quoted below is some feedback basically asking for a way to:

 a) make &lt;select&gt; not have a default value
 b) show a placeholder when there's no default value
 c) make picking a selection required for submission

Something like:

  &lt;label&gt;
   Country:
   &lt;select placeholder=&quot;Select a country&quot; required=&quot;&quot; value=&quot;&quot; name=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Ukraine
    &lt;option&gt;Norway
   &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;/label&gt;

Requests b) and c) are easy; we can just port placeholder=&quot;&quot; and 
required=&quot;&quot;; request a) is a little harder because we have to have a way 
to indicate that no &lt;option&gt; should be selected, but using value=&quot;&quot; seems 
reasonable if we've added value=&quot;&quot; as part of another request.

However, I am loath to do this right now, because, as noted earlier, we 
already have a lot of new features in the forms section and these are not 
really all that critical in comparison to some of the other features.

So, I have noted them as &quot;v2&quot; feature requests in the markup in a comment 
in the &lt;select&gt; section, but I haven't yet added them. If and when 
implementations reach a state where implementations could benefit from 
more features to implement, then we can look at adding these.

</I>&gt;<i> since the default selected option is disabled, it will not submit a 
</I>&gt;<i> value. In this case, the option's @value makes no difference and can be 
</I>&gt;<i> an empty string or any value at all. (Note that Firefox is a little 
</I>&gt;<i> buggy in that when clicking on the select list, the shown selected 
</I>&gt;<i> option won't change but the value submitted will change to the first

</I>&gt;<i> once the one of the options is selected by the user, they are unable to 
</I>&gt;<i> re-select the disabled option, as with Safari and Opera.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a demo:

</I>&gt;<i> perhaps an &quot;unselected&quot; boolean attribute would make sense. 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, WebKit still submits the first OPTION as the value even

</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the original topic of this thread, the <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">select at required</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, when select.selectedIndex == -1 (whether set programmatically 
</I>&gt;<i> or via some &quot;unselected&quot; boolean attribute), a @required attribute

</I>&gt;<i> everything's golden.  If not, the author makes the very first &lt;option&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> will also need to be supported into the future as fallback material.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think yes.  If there is an appropriate default value, we don't need a 
</I>&gt;<i> hint.  This is similar to a text input with @value - a good value is 
</I>&gt;<i> already provided, and the &lt;label&gt; and context provides the rest of what 
</I>&gt;<i> you need. However, if there is *not* an appropriate default value, the 
</I>&gt;<i> current practice makes this known *only* to the server-side script.  
</I>&gt;<i> The UA has no way of knowing that the &lt;select&gt; is officially in an 
</I>&gt;<i> invalid position at the moment, and so can't provide automatic 
</I>&gt;<i> validation help (like it can with &lt;input @pattern&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So that's the only problem we really have to solve - how to tell the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> that the first &lt;option&gt; in the &lt;select&gt; is invalid.  We Two things 
</I>&gt;<i> present themselves to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Allow @hint as a boolean attribute on the first &lt;option&gt;.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing more than what I said above - a hint to the UA that the first 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;option&gt; in the list isn't a valid choice, so it should display as 
</I>&gt;<i> normal but not be submittable with this value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Put @hint as a text attribute on &lt;select&gt;.  This would then display 
</I>&gt;<i> initially on the collapsed &lt;select&gt;.  Upon selecting a value, the hint 
</I>&gt;<i> disappears and &lt;select&gt; acts like normal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Option (1) is easy.  However, it breaks symmetry with the proposed 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input&gt;/&lt;textarea&gt; @hint attribute.  As well, it still provides an 
</I>&gt;<i> officially selectable attribute, even if the UA prevents the form from 
</I>&gt;<i> actually being submitted with it.  The best user experience would be if 
</I>&gt;<i> the user simply couldn't select this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Option (2) has some possibilities when we consider the fallback issue.  
</I>&gt;<i> For legacy UAs we must allow a 'default' value that the server can 
</I>&gt;<i> detect, and this should be expressed as the first &lt;option&gt; to match 
</I>&gt;<i> current strategies, so that it will be automatically submitted if the 
</I>&gt;<i> user makes no choice.  We can exploit this.  I think it's reasonable to 
</I>&gt;<i> say that if @hint is specified on the &lt;select&gt;, and the first &lt;option&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> has no text within it, the UA can choose to *not display* that first 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;option&gt;.  This produces exactly what we want - an initially displayed 
</I>&gt;<i> hint that disappears as soon as the user actually interacts with the 
</I>&gt;<i> control, just like @hint works on a text input. In legacy UAs that don't 
</I>&gt;<i> understand @hint, they'll simply display a blank &lt;option&gt; initially, 
</I>&gt;<i> which will be submitted with the author-supplied default value (so &quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't reserved as the default and unusable as an actual value).  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> a reasonable fallback method, and is used today in many cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To jump to another issue, I do *not* believe the hint should be 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed when the &lt;select&gt; is expanded.  That's similar to displaying 
</I>&gt;<i> the hint when the user has focused a text input.  If you need any help 
</I>&gt;<i> inside of a &lt;select&gt;, you have &lt;optgroup&gt;, which is more flexible.  You 
</I>&gt;<i> can wrap all the &lt;option&gt;s in an &lt;optgroup&gt; if you really need text in 
</I>&gt;<i> the expanded &lt;select&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, pulling it all together, my proposal for a hinting ability on 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;select&gt; is thus:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;select&gt; can have a @hint attribute, which takes a text value.  If there 
</I>&gt;<i> is no &lt;option @selected&gt;, then this hint is initially displayed in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;select&gt;'s collapsed state.  As soon as an option is selected, though 
</I>&gt;<i> (or if an &lt;option&gt; had @selected initially), the hint disappears and the 
</I>&gt;<i> selected &lt;option&gt;'s text is instead displayed in the &lt;select&gt;'s 
</I>&gt;<i> collapsed state. When @hint is supplied, a conforming UA will not allow 
</I>&gt;<i> the form to be submitted until an option is selected (again, an &lt;option&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> with @selected specified counts here), indicating in some way that a 
</I>&gt;<i> value in the &lt;select&gt; must be chosen (the exact method UAs use to 
</I>&gt;<i> indicate this to users is left undefined, but should be similar to how 
</I>&gt;<i> the UA alerts a user that an &lt;input&gt; with @required is empty and must be 
</I>&gt;<i> filled).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For fallback, authors should provide an empty &lt;option&gt; (or one 
</I>&gt;<i> containing only whitespace) with an appropriate default @value as the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;select&gt;'s first child.  If &lt;optgroup&gt;s are used, this &lt;option&gt; should 
</I>&gt;<i> come before them. Conforming UAs will not display this &lt;option&gt;.  In 
</I>&gt;<i> legacy UAs, this will cause the &lt;select&gt; to initially display as blank 
</I>&gt;<i> in the collapsed state, and will submit the author-supplied default 
</I>&gt;<i> value as the value of the control if the user does not make a proper

</I>&gt;<i> author should probably give the first option @selected, but that would 
</I>&gt;<i> prevent the hint from displaying; there are some tradeoffs here.  
</I>&gt;<i> Without the @selected it works the same, though.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, this markup works differently:

</I>&gt;<i> actively selecting a value, the UA will prevent it and inform them that 
</I>&gt;<i> they must select a value in the control.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a legacy UA, on the other hand, the &lt;select&gt; will initially display 
</I>&gt;<i> empty when collapsed, and will have a blank line as the first option

</I>&gt;<i> select the blank &lt;option&gt;, which is just as invalid), and that the user 
</I>&gt;<i> should be returned to the form with an error message.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, of course, contrast that with this markup, which is how you would
