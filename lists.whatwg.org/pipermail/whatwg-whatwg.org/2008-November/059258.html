(In the interests of avoiding cross-posting, I have only sent this e-mail 
to the whatwg list. The original e-mails were also crossposted to the IETF 
URI list and the rest-discuss list.)


This might be a good time to bring the FAQ to people's attention -- it 
covers what we ask people to go through when proposing new features:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F</A>

I encourage people to follow this process.

Why isn't the current form submission mechanism, with a redirect on the 
server-side, not acceptable?

This is great -- why is it not enough?


I have to admit to being a little concerned over the complexity of the URI 
template language as currently proposed.

Because it adds significant complexity to the browser platform, without

</I>
I don't understand why this is such a big deal. Such, the URIs are nicer, 
but, big deal. Just do a redirect if it matters that much.

</I>
Why would scripts preclude accessibility? And are you really expecting 
search engines to fill in forms that would use templates? (Some search 
engines fill in forms, but it's usually for searches, where the content 
would most properly be in the query component.)

Something that can't be done without the feature. Something that allows 
authors to write applications that make users say &quot;wow!&quot;, which they can't 
do today.

Agreed.

You can do it now with redirects or scripts. It's not clear to me that 
this is a feature that is important enough to ever be in the browser.

That's how many parts of HTML5 have made it in.

There are many many gaps, why is this an important one to fill?

I encourage you to work with the browser vendors directly, as discussed 
here:

</I>
TBL did exactly what we're suggesting you do -- he wrote his own spec, 
wrote his own client, and wrote his own server, and put it out there. He 
didn't wait for a Standards Process to give him a stamp of approval.

(Why can't Mechanize support script?)

Why not just provide links, or use a redirect?

What if the URI you have to compute is more complicated than just 
substitution, like some parts being dependent on others, or needing 
calculation, or whatnot?


[snip 2, which was the same idea]


&gt;<i> 3.) I am writing a blog post on Blogger.com about &quot;Ride to Work Day&quot; where I

</I>&gt;<i> include a form that let's them type in their ZIP code and check there
</I>&gt;<i> weather:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; template=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.weather.com/weather/local/{zip">http://www.weather.com/weather/local/{zip</A>}/&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;zip&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Check Weather!&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/form&gt;
</I>
What if the user types something that isn't supported by weather.com, like 
the string &quot;x&quot;?

Also, why can't you just do:

  &lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced">http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced</A>&quot;&gt;
   &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;where&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Check Weather!&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;

...? That works today.

I don't really follow what you're saying here. I see no practical 
difference between URI templates and normal forms in terms of Google 
crawling the results.

I don't think anyone is denying that it is useful in certain cases. The 
question is whether it will be used widely enough to make it worth it.
