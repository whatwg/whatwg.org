It's intentional.

While readyState is NETWORK_EMPTY, setting .src, appending &lt;source&gt; 
elements, or inserting a &lt;video&gt; into the document causes the load() 
algorithm to be implicitly run. Once readyState is NETWORK_IDLE or 
greater, those actions have no effect. So to prevent race conditions, the 
list is generated immediately before setting readyState to a value other 
than NETWORK_EMPTY.


&gt;<i> 2. Did you remove canPlayType? It was added in

</I>&gt;<i> seems to be gone, but I can't find the revision in which that happened.
</I>
It's on HTMLMediaElement now.


&gt;<i> 3. MEDIA_ERR_DECODE isn't just for corrupted data. If &lt;source 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;application/ogg&quot;&gt; is given and the browser doesn't &quot;know it cannot

</I>&gt;<i> (perhaps it was Ogg FLAC), isn't MEDIA_ERR_DECODE precisely what should 
</I>&gt;<i> happen?
</I>
No; now that load() tries multiple streams, that would cause a 
MEDIA_ERR_NONE_SUPPORTED error.


I believe you sent this e-mail as I was updating the load() algorithm and 
moving canPlayType() around, which is probable the source of your
confusion. I hope this clarifies things. Let me know if you disagree with 
the changes that were made!
