Ok. Done.

</I>
I've made the method return strings.

I think it would be misleading to return false from cannotPlayType().

Well we have to have a maybe case, since the UA might not know the answer.


&gt;<i> also - when you probe for mime type, do you mean the entire &quot;type&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter (including the codecs string) ? for example, there are too 
</I>&gt;<i> many cases where just passing &quot;video/mp4&quot; would be insufficient. 
</I>&gt;<i> (fragmented index support ? base/main/high profile ? paff ? cabac ?)
</I>
Clarified this.

</I>&gt;<i> trivial formats (audio/wav).
</I>
Indeed (except for audio/wave).


&gt;<i> When asking about application/ogg, this could mean 2 things:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. &quot;can I demux Ogg streams?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 2. &quot;can I demux Ogg streams and decode unknown codecs?&quot;
</I>
It's the second (and thus the answer can only ever be &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;no&quot;).


&gt;<i> The answer to question 1 is reasonably simple to answer in most cases, 
</I>&gt;<i> even if the underlying media frame doesn't support querying for mime 
</I>&gt;<i> types a mapping between mime type and supported decoders isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The answer to question 2, on the other hand, is always &quot;no&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot;.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> Unless the codecs parameter is to be made mandatory I think that spec 
</I>&gt;<i> should explicitly make it such that the question asked is 1. In either 
</I>&gt;<i> case we will end up there because 2 is not a meaningful question and 
</I>&gt;<i> user agents will make untruthful answers in attempts to stay compatible 
</I>&gt;<i> with unknown and future content (which might be supported by installing 
</I>&gt;<i> new codecs in the media framework without upgrading the browser).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, if the codec parameter is used then the user agent may answer yes 
</I>&gt;<i> and no in a way that actually makes some sense.
</I>
The spec now encourages codecs=&quot;&quot; be provided.


&gt;<i> I also think that this should be explicitly related to the type 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute of the source element. One should be able to use canPlayType 
</I>&gt;<i> to predict with 100% accuracy which source the user agent will use when 
</I>&gt;<i> it encounters.
</I>
Done.

</I>&gt;<i> information is given in the MIME type.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what the incentives are for browsers to lie. If we

</I>&gt;<i> information, or their scripts won't work. I don't see how that would 
</I>&gt;<i> change over time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Authors should be strongly encouraged to give the codec parameters.
</I>
Agreed.

</I>
I've left it as a three-state method, but encouraged implementors to not 
return a positive answer unless they're sure.
