</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course that's possible, but, as you noticed too, only by redefining the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;small&gt; semantics, and is not a best choice per se. That's both because the
</I>&gt;<i> original semantics for the &lt;small&gt; tag was targeted to styling and nothing
</I>&gt;<i> else (the html 4 document type definitions declared it as a member of the
</I>&gt;<i> fontstyle entity, while, for instance, &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; were parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> phrase entity), and because the term 'small', at first glance, suggests the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of a typographical function, regardless any other related concept which
</I>&gt;<i> might be specific for the English (or whatever else) culture, but might not
</I>&gt;<i> be as well immediate for non-English developers all around the world. As a
</I>&gt;<i> consequence, since any average developer could just rely on the old
</I>&gt;<i> semantics, being he intuitively confident with it, the semantics
</I>&gt;<i> redefinition could find a first counter-indication: let's think on a word
</I>&gt;<i> written with alternate &lt;b&gt; and &lt;small&gt; letters, or just to a paragraph first
</I>&gt;<i> letter evidenced by a &lt;b&gt;, obviously the application of the new semantics
</I>&gt;<i> here would be untrivial (i.e. an assistive software for blind users would be
</I>&gt;<i> fouled by this and give unpredictable results). Despite the previous use
</I>&gt;<i> case would be a misuse of the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;small&gt; markup, yet it would be
</I>&gt;<i> possible, meaning not prohibited, and so creating a new element with a
</I>&gt;<i> proper semantic could be a better choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No matter *what* we do, if there *is* a default style for an element, it
will be misused by people.  This is a fact of life.  Defining a new element
which is identical to &lt;small&gt; in every way except that it hasn't been
misused *yet* is thus a mug's game, because it *will* be misused in the same
way as &lt;small&gt;, and then we just have two identical elements for no reason.

Yes, bad markup will foul up semantic agents.  But people will *always*
write bad markup.  At least with the semantic redefinition we get to declare
lots of usages that *are* appropriate to be conforming without any effort on
the author's part.

And really, the type of people who would write a word with alternating
letters wrapped in &lt;b&gt; and &lt;small&gt; tags are hardly the kind to even *care*
about semantics.

But, you're right, we have to deal with backward compatibility, and
&gt;<i> redefining the &lt;small&gt; and &lt;b&gt; semantics can be a good compromise, since a
</I>&gt;<i> new element would face some heavy concerns, mainly related to rendering and
</I>&gt;<i> to the state of the art implementations in non-visual user agents (and the
</I>&gt;<i> alike).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think that a solution, at least partial, can be found for the
</I>&gt;<i> rendering concern (and I'd push for this being done anyway, since there are
</I>&gt;<i> several new elements defined for HTML 5). Most user agents are capable to
</I>&gt;<i> interpret a dtd to some extent, so it could be worth the effort to define an
</I>&gt;<i> html 5 specific dtd in addition to the parsing roules - which aim to
</I>&gt;<i> overcome all problems arising by previous dtd-only html specifications - so
</I>&gt;<i> that a non html5-fully-compliant browser can somehow interpret any new
</I>&gt;<i> elements. HTML 5 Doctype declaration could accept a dtd just for backward
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility purpose, and any fully compliant user agent would just ignore
</I>&gt;<i> such dtd. More specifically, such a dtd could define default values for some
</I>&gt;<i> attributes, such as the style attribute (to have any new element properly
</I>&gt;<i> rendered - some assistive technologies are capable to interpret style sheets
</I>&gt;<i> too), and, anyway, there should be a way, in SMGL, to create an alias for an
</I>&gt;<i> element (i.e., a new element - let's call it &lt;incidental&gt; - could be aliased
</I>&gt;<i> to &lt;small&gt; for better compatibility).
</I>

Html5 is no longer an SGML language.


&gt;<i> Let's come to the non-typographical interpretation a today u.a. may be
</I>&gt;<i> capable of, as in your example about lynx. This can be a very good reason to
</I>&gt;<i> deem &lt;small&gt; a very good choice. But, are we sure that *every* existing user
</I>&gt;<i> agent can do that? If the answer is yes, we can stop here: &lt;small&gt; is a
</I>&gt;<i> perfect choise. Better: &lt;small&gt; is all we need, so let's stop bothering each
</I>&gt;<i> other about this matter. But if the answer is no, we have to face a number
</I>&gt;<i> of user agents needing an update to understand the new semantics for the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;small&gt; tag, and so, if the new semantics can be assumed as *surely*
</I>&gt;<i> reliable only with new/updated u.a.'s (that is, with those ones fully
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with html 5 specifications), that's somehow like to be starting
</I>&gt;<i> from scratch, and consequently there is space for a new, more appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> element.
</I>

I don't understand.  If some obscure UA can't extract an appropriate meaning
from &lt;small&gt; and come up with a device-appropriate rendering, why does that
mean we should have a new element?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  However, you would appreciate that the author had wished for some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular words to stand out from the surrounding text.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's a job for the style sheet, whether it's provided by the author
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or by the user agent.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The style-sheet can only pick out particular words if those words have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been marked-up as special in the document, so it doesn't solve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem of how to mark them up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Further, this isn't using &lt;b&gt; because the house style is to have all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text in a bold weight (that can be done by style-sheets, and if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> style-sheet is missing all the content is still there); it's using &lt;b&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to convey _some_ semantics: namely that those particular words are in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some way special.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if the mark-up is &lt;span class=&quot;brand_name&quot;&gt; or similar and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distinguishing presentation added with CSS then users without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> style-sheets are completely unaware that the author identified those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> words as being special.  Whereas with &lt;b&gt;, everybody gets to know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from considering that &lt;b&gt; isn't a good choice in such a case
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; are far better, since they were born with the proper
</I>&gt;<i> semantics), personally I hope in the near future every user agent (or at
</I>&gt;<i> least any thought for human interaction) will be style-sheets compatible
</I>&gt;<i> (meaning at least capable to draw importance and order from them), so that
</I>&gt;<i> anything related to presentation, in any presentation media, would be
</I>&gt;<i> separable from content.
</I>

No, Smyler's example was referencing things that specifically should *not*
be marked up with &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;.  They're not being emphasized nor are
they of greater importance than the rest of the text - they are merely
purposely offset from the surrounding text for some reason (besides emphasis
or importance).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If the print was for a blind person, printed with braille, one could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> imagine (had it been supported) that letters with a higher weight
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could be physically warmer than others, or with a more jagged edge so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they could stand out.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yup -- and an HTML-to-braille converter could choose to do that with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> words marked in &lt;b&gt;, whereas it couldn't with &lt;span class=&quot;BrandName&quot;&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, it could if it were capable to understand CSS 2 and the
</I>&gt;<i> 'BrandName' class were thought for this purpose too (i.e. if properties were
</I>&gt;<i> declared accordingly for the aureal media type, since I think bringing less
</I>&gt;<i> or more emphasys from aureal sheets to a brail presentation should be easy
</I>&gt;<i> enough).
</I>

In the meantime, though, a hypothetical braille reader could run on existing
sites right now.  As well, the idea that authors will regularly keep up a
braille version of their style sheets is a pipe dream - it's rare enough to
find print stylesheets around, and those actually help sighted users.  &lt;span
class=&quot;BrandName&quot;&gt; *only* conveys something to the user if they can perceive
the style you are assigning to it.  &lt;b&gt; conveys at least the semantic that
this text is slightly different, and it does so in a way that is harmonious
with the majority of existing uses in the wild.  You really shouldn't use
&lt;b&gt; to denote a heading, but if you *do*, at least it presents a better
semantic than &lt;span class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt; does.
