<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, both as an author and as a user I'd prefer this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/report&quot;">http://example.com/report&quot;</A>&gt;html report&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/report.pdf&quot;">http://example.com/report.pdf&quot;</A>&gt;pdf report&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/report.xhtml&quot;">http://example.com/report.xhtml&quot;</A>&gt;xml report&lt;/a&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Keep It Simple. For me as an author it's less typing, and for me as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a computer-literate end user it's clear whether a link is going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make me wait for Acrobat loading or open directly - even if the link
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is taken out of the HTML context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's less typing&quot; - Is that serious or are you joking?!
</I>
Isn't it? :)

&gt;<i> I disagree; it's no more clear to end users. There is no reason the status
</I>&gt;<i> bar at the bottom couldn't say
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://example.com/report">http://example.com/report</A> (PDF Document)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Trivial addition for browsers to take this information from the Accept
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.
</I>
Not quite &quot;trivial&quot;, since browsers to do what you ask would need to
maintain a table of &quot;pretty&quot; names for all MIME types - including
translating that table to all languages the UI is translated to...

On a more serious note: content negotiation is meant to automatically
choose a variant of a resource (format, language). However, in many
cases the variant is significant in a way that I as a user want
control over. The language and even format of a resource is actually
often essential to that resource's identity. (The whole
content-negotiation idea is based on that statement being false. I
believe it's true.).

I've built two-three websites that use content/language negotiation
and I now consider it an architectural mistake to rely on negotiation
because the URLs no longer uniquely identify the variants I in many
scenarios need to identify. It's OK-ish to do it as a pure format
choice where the server and UA just agree on using the PNG or GIF
version for an &lt;IMG&gt; tag. For links *users* (and FWIW search engines,
validators and other agents) may interact with it's however a big
mistake to move away from one URL per variant of a resource. In light
of my content negotiation experiments and experience I'd say an Access
attribute in HTML would be harmful to the usability of URLs.

As a URL user (web browsing human, HTML author, linker, bookmarker,
E-mail-with-links author) I often want to be sure about what variant
of a resource I link to. To be explicit about this across scenarios
requires explicit URLs with language and type information.

&gt;<i> If you put .pdf at the end a URL the server wont necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> respond with a PDF content type, so any extra certainty you feel from that
</I>&gt;<i> is artificial.
</I>
File types are all about convention. It's useful when sites follow the
convention, and it's a surprise in the rare event when they don't.
Since most of the time they do it's more useful than harmful.

&gt;&gt;<i> Content negotiation is a lot nicer in theory than in practise..
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well it's not nice in practice because HTML is currently flawed
</I>
After thinking about it I've concluded that it's not nice in practice
because the basic premise of content negotiation is fundamentally
flawed, namely that what variant of a resource users get from a URL is
insignificant and what's best for them can be determined
automatically.

&gt;<i> The apparent resistance to this confuses me; since the solution is not
</I>&gt;<i> complicated to implement, completely backwards compatible, and ignorable.
</I>
My scepticism has nothing to do with whether it's easy to implement
(though I think you underestimate the required efforts - for example
the UA would need to verify that provided Accept: values are
correct/don't cause security problems etc.). My scepticism has nothing
to do with whether it is backwards compatible either. As a URL user I
just want to defend the usability of URLs against a theoretically more
pure but for practical purposes deeply flawed solution to a
non-problem.
