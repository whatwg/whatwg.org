&quot;5 seconds after the big bang&quot; is an exceedingly ill-defined time, though.
Currently you'd be lucky to peg it within a billion years of the accurate
time, ignoring any relativistic issues with timekeeping.  This was Ian's
point about far-past dates being nearly never exact enough to justify a
machine-readable timestamp.


&gt;<i> There are more factors to take into consideration in this example than just

</I>&gt;<i> So... Wouldn't it be far more efficient and convinient to have a

</I>&gt;<i> a relative reference. I don't think this would have to be dealt with by the

</I>

How does this solve the issue of the base time being too ill-defined for a
timestamp?  Assuming you have a basetime of &quot;the big bang&quot;, you can
certainly exactly specify exactly 5 seconds after, but how would you specify
the basetime?

You're just moving the issue one level back.  This doesn't solve the
underlying issue that far-past dates aren't exact enough to give them a
timestamp.  This problem requires an entirely different solution, and trying
to shoehorn it into a timestamp-based solution just gives you two bad
solutions.
