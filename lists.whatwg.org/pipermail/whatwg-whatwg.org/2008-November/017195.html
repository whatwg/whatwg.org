<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>If we wish to communicate that level of semantics, yes.  It may not be useful to us.  If you *really* need some metadata/semantics, @class probably can't convey it with enough granularity.  Check out the big discussion from a few months ago about ccRel and RDFa.
</I> 

Not yet maybe, but we could at least try to keep options open for the future.


&gt;&gt;<i>Second: Suppose I want to collect all copyright notices from 1000 websites (don't ask me why, I just want to), how am I to do this when they are marked up in &lt;small&gt;s? I will definatly end up with a lot of text that has nothing to do with copyrights (and probably miss a lot of copyright notices as they are marked up differently) Whereas If they were maked up in (for example) &lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt; I could retrieve it all based on the class-name.
</I>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>That would be a wonderful perfect world.  I'd like the copyright date as well, so I can retrieve only things copyrighted in the last ten years.  Assuming that metadata will exist is a fool's errand.  The fact is that if you are searching for copyright notices, the most efficient way is likely to just search for the string &quot;copyright&quot; and the (c) symbol.  That'll net you copyright notices with a high accuracy, and some training on real data can yield further rules to improve the data-mining accuracy.
</I>
You say it yourself, only in a perfect world where all websites in the world would be written in the same language would your &quot;solution&quot; work. Unfortunatly I would miss out on all the chinese copyright stuff.
But another example (based on &quot;siemens&quot;) wouldn't it be nice if I could tell Google I am looking for a person named &quot;Siemens&quot; so it would ignore the &quot;brand&quot;-name?


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>While we're hoping for copyright notices to be marked up as &lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;, though, why not wish for &lt;small class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;?  If you're going to be providing metadata, it works the same.  Is it that you believe people won't provide a special class for copyrights if the &lt;small&gt; tag already gives them the preferred display?  Do you believe that everyone will automatically use class=&quot;copyright&quot; to mark up their copyright notices?  What if they use class=&quot;copyright-notice&quot;?  Or class=&quot;license&quot;?  Or any of a million other distinct possibilities that would destroy any naive attempt to datamine based on a particular class name?
</I>

Well, that would have to be defined in the standard, wouldn't it? I'm not saying -again- it should be defined NOW, but at least leave the door open.
I have no problems with using small over span, neither one is correct as far as I can see, in this context. Using &quot;copyright&quot; instead of &quot;license&quot; or &quot;copyright-notice&quot; would have to be defined somewhere, either in the standard or in an externally maintained &quot;document&quot; that is accepted as &quot;best practice&quot; or &quot;standards related&quot;.

PS: I find it very difficult to respond to rich-text/html messages as they seriously mess up the indentation. Sorry therfor if this message is unclear as original message and reply are mixed up.
