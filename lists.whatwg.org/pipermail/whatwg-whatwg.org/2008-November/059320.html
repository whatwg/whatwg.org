It has been shown that prompts are ignored by users, so that wouldn't 
really solve the problem.

It seems like browsers should do this already based on the lang=&quot;&quot; 
attribute. I recommend asking browser vendors to implement this.

It's true that this may not be something browsers want to implement.
