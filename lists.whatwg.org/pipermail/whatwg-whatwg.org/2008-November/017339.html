I don't think that would be useful. What if the message reaches the target
but the target dies while the message is queued? Or it dies after executing
the first JS statement in the message handler?

The only way to be sure that a message has been processed to receive a
response from the target saying so.

If I was implementing workers in their own processes, I'd be tempted to make
abnormal termination of the worker fatal to any Web page that was aware of
the existence of the worker. The principle of &quot;if you can't follow the spec,
destroy the evidence so no-one can prove it&quot;.

healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
