I've now heard a need for such an attribute from more than on implementer.

I don't see addition of a duration attribute as much of a problem. We
have width and height for images, and sizes for fonts, too, and web
developers have learnt how to deal with these in various entities (px,
em, pt). I would not have a problem giving web developers the
opportunity to report the real duration of a video in an attribute in
either bytes or seconds (might be better called: length), which would
allow a renderer to display an accurate timeline. It is help for a
display mechanism just as width and height are.

In case of contradiction between the attribute and the actual decoded
length, a renderer can still override the length attribute at the time
the real length is known. In case of contradiction between the
attribute and the estimated length of a video, the renderer should
make a call based on the probability of the estimate being correct.

In may in fact be rather confusing to users if a video player keeps
changing the duration of a video file as it plays it back.

I think such an attribute can help get this right earlier.

Regards,
Silvia.

I think it will lead to more videos having the correct timeline
displayed right from the start, and less changes in the display of a
video's duration (which in fact may be rather confusing to users if
