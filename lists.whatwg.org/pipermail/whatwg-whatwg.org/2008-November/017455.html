I wouldn't recommend running an HTTP parser in the kernel either. Anywhere 
where you can safely run an HTTP parser you can run an HTML parser too.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number, whatever, and submit the form. Just like a user.

Well if you don't have the credentials, you can't really login anyway.

If the request is to be able to take an HTML form and display it to the 
user as some other UI, then just apply the HTML semantics to the form to 
get the UI out. That's exactly what HTML is _for_: encoding media- and 
presentation-independent semantics.


&gt;<i> PS: But even if it doesn't help authenticating without an HTML based UI, 
</I>&gt;<i> this could be useful because it allows non-interactive clients to

</I>
Indeed.
