&gt;<i> &gt; Would the sender of that link necessarily know all the formats the URL

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; round here people just copy and paste a URL into an instant message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and send it without any surrounding text.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whereas without any other information, people will generally open URLs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a web browser.  So it'd be faster just to send the URL of the page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which contains hypertext links to all the formats; at which point we no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; longer care whether those links specify the format in the URL or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The HTML version of that URL could provide the web page representation
</I>&gt;<i> *and* provide links to all the other content types available.
</I>
How about other representations? (I know we're discussing HTML here,
and not HTTP, but what if a resource has no HTML representation? are
you proposing adding this capability to PDF, MSOffice, OpenDocument,
et al. too?)

&gt;<i> &gt; What is the point of doing it in HTTP if it's being done in HTML anyway?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Nothing is 'done' in HTML, it's a markup language. It's being done (at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment) in the URI. HTTP provides conneg, why would you consciously
</I>&gt;<i> deny developers the opportunity to use it in browsers? Unless HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> provides the markup, this isn't possible. This means Browsers don't have
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to fully support HTTP without having to use JavaScript rubbish;
</I>&gt;<i> there is a window of opportunity to change this with HTML5.
</I>
No. Browsers fully support HTTP in the sense that they send an Accept
header dependent of their *capabilities*.
If you want client-driven conneg, then use agent-driven/transparent
(RFCs 2295/2296), not server-driven conneg. This is explicitly noted
in RFC 2616 that server-driven negotiation has limits and can be
disadvantageous depending on your needs.
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html#sec12">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec12.html#sec12</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; True.  But if the current way of doing it is good enough, there's no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incentive to change.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Define 'enough'..! I don't know why/how you get the authority to
</I>&gt;<i> make that assumption! And before you say it; I'm not assuming any
</I>&gt;<i> authority myself - I'm trying to encourage you to help browsers conform
</I>&gt;<i> to the protocol they make use of.
</I>
Maybe you could explain how browsers do not conform to HTTP? (and no,
HTTP does not mandate user-agents to give the control of the Accept-*
headers to the user or the... server?!)
There's an extension to HTTP (TCN/RSVA, RFCs 2295/2296) that gives the
servers the ability to describe the available variants of a given
resource in a content-type independent way. You'd rather push browser
vendors to implement TCN/RSVA than HTML5 to add a content-type
dependent equivalent.

See also <A HREF="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dggq7g95_10cd8zj5">http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dggq7g95_10cd8zj5</A>

&gt;<i> - I'll say it again: I'm encouraging you to help browsers become
</I>&gt;<i> better HTTP clients; surely that is high on the agenda here.. right?!
</I>
No, we're discussing HTML and some &quot;Web APIs&quot; here, not HTTP.


&gt;<i> &gt; Or what about if I wanted to mail somebody pointing out a discrepency
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between two versions of the report, and wished to link to both of them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's tricky if they have the same URL.  Possibly I could do it like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have with the wget command-line above, but that requires me knowing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which browsers my audience use and the precise syntax for them.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - separate versions are separate resources, not separate content types. That
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to do with conneg..
</I>
s/version/variant/
Variants still need be produced by someone or something, and there
really might be discrepencies between them; that's why there's a
&quot;quality&quot; parameter in TCN/RSVA (and thus in Apache type-map files,
for instance)
