</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that if real security is desired, SSL is the only way to go. 
</I>&gt;<i> However given that most login forms on the web send passwords in the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Form + Digest avoids these SSL problems:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Does not negatively impact performance. In TLS handshake lots of messages
</I>&gt;<i> are going back and forth, so this can't be fixed by beefing up servers' CPUs.
</I>
This is also the case with form authentication.

&gt;<i> * Does not need access to server's configuration, and generation, installation
</I>&gt;<i> and renewal of certificates. Redistributable software can support it out of
</I>&gt;<i> the box, on almost any server, without manual installation steps.
</I>
Form authentication is even easier to support than Digest auth.


&gt;<i> Additionally, it's better than new &quot;WWW-Authenticate: HTML&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication mechanism:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * It's compatible with existing non-HTML HTTP clients.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> * Although its security is weak compared to SSL, it's a step up from forms +
</I>&gt;<i> cookies.
</I>
Not really. If you can sniff the password from forms + cookies, then you 
can almost always also MitM a Digest connection, after which point you 
have basically lost.


&gt;<i> * It's easier to sell: &quot;It will allow bots to log in&quot; doesn't sound very 
</I>&gt;<i> desirable. &quot;It will protect your users' passwords against passive 
</I>&gt;<i> eavesdropping&quot; sounds better.
</I>
Unfortunately, both of those advantages pale in comparison to &quot;you can 
style your login form&quot;, which is the real advantage of &quot;WWW-Authenticate: 
HTML&quot; and (in particular) HTML form authentication.


&gt;<i> I don't think &quot;WWW-Authenticate: HTML&quot; is a significant improvement. It 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't offer anything to existing websites/browsers. It's primarily 
</I>&gt;<i> targetted for non-browser UAs, but it's not compatible with them. If UAs 
</I>&gt;<i> are required to parse HTML, they could as well look for form with a 
</I>&gt;<i> single password field.
</I>
I agree that it's not that great. But it is slightly better than nothing, 
and the cost to support this is pretty minimal.
