For what it's worth we set all &quot;user-agent specified amount of time&quot; 
times as close to 0 as we can in our implementation. There's always a 
tiny amount of delay in cross-thread communication, in the order of 
fractions of a second.

</I>
For what it's worth we support the ECMAScript JSON object inside the 
worker (along with things like Math and Date) which means that you can 
manually JSON-ify you objects when communicating.

&gt;&gt;<i> WorkerUtils does not implement document.cookie. I imagine this would be

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not clear which document the cookie would be for. localStorage is 
</I>&gt;<i> as light-weight than cookies (lighter-weight, arguably), though, so that 
</I>&gt;<i> should be enough, no?
</I>
If you really need cookie information you can always call postMessage 
and ask for it.

Actually, i think we should remove the location accessor as well. I 
can't think of a common enough use case that warrants an explicit API. 
You can always transfer the data through postMessage.
