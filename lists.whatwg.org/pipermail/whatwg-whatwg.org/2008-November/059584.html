After reading more feedback, I'm agreeing with you, but note that my
original point wasn't against what you were saying anyway.  ^_^  It was just
disputing that a counter-based js loop would kill performance.

Noted, though, that many people will, without thinking, just update on every
tick rather than figuring out what a significant interval to use is, and
that the potential differences in tick speed (4Hz to 66Hz right now, right?
somewhere around there?) mean that you *can't* just run a simple counter and
update every nth tick.  You'll still have to do some time comparisons.
