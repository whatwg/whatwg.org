</I>
Yes it does; it's specified that they are equivalent:

  For historical reasons, user agents must also treat link, a, and area
  elements that have a rev  attribute with the value &quot;made&quot; as having
  the author keyword specified as a link relationship.

  -- <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/structured-client-side-storage.html#link-type-author">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/structured-client-side-storage.html#link-type-author</A>

&gt;<i> Reverse and Inverse properties are key factors of any Semantics
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> without both @rev and @rel there is hardly any semantics at all just a
</I>&gt;<i> one way stream of information,
</I>
That simply isn't true, since it's always possible to define rel=foo and
rel=bar where bar conveys the same semantics as foo but in the opposite
direction; no rev needed.

&gt;<i> which most of the time you have to guess what the Authors intentions
</I>&gt;<i> were.
</I>
Not at all, since part of the definition of the rel values says in which
direction they are to be interpreted.  For example, rel=author

  indicates that the referenced document provides further information
  about the author of the section that the element defining the
  hyperlink applies to.

&gt;<i> rel=author on the whole only relates to published documents,  rel=made
</I>&gt;<i> relates to  Documents, Music, Photos, Videos, Sunday Lunch! Literaly
</I>&gt;<i> anything that can be *made*
</I>
So the problem is that if I wanted to be able to create a link from my
Sunday lunch to its cook, annotating it as such, I wouldn't be able to
do so because rel=author isn't appropriate terminology to use in meals?

That's true, but given that my Sunday lunch isn't written in HTML
anyway, I don't see how it could be trying to use rel=author (or indeed
rev=made) in the first place!  Ditto for all your other examples.  By
definition the thing which is making the rel=author link has to be
written in HTML 5, and therefore has an author of some sort.

&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, since the definition of &quot;rel&quot; in HTML5 allows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relationships in either direction to be defined, there is no need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anymore for a separate rev=&quot;&quot; attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So essentially @rel in html5 is breaking the semantics of @rel just
</I>&gt;<i> because it cant deal with @rev?
</I>
No, the semantics of rel aren't changed from existing use; HTML 5 takes
care not to break existing widespread use.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the misuse of &quot;stylesheet&quot; is trivial and only a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; informing  authors of their error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, who's going to be doing the informing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The publishers of HTML5
</I>
Why should they bother to do that when then can more easily define the
problem no longer to exist?

&gt;<i> &gt; Authors who today use rev=&quot;made&quot; could equally well use rel=&quot;author&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without loss of generality IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK then example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am the author of numerous websites and I decide (like many people do)  
</I>&gt;<i> to place some links on my homepage a portfolio If you like.
</I>&gt;<i> My Homepage is at : <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my link &lt;a rel=&quot;author&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&quot;&gt; Groovy  
</I>&gt;<i> Site&lt;/a&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Above Statement (In HTML4) says
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt; Authored  &lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which Is rubbish its the other way round
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;<i> The Same statement in HTML5 will say (because @rel is a reverse and
</I>&gt;<i> inverse link type)
</I>
I don't understand what you mean by the part in parentheses.  Please
could you expand on it, or provide a reference.

&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt; Authored  &lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; <A HREF="http://groovydeveloper.com/">http://groovydeveloper.com/</A>&gt;  Authored &lt;<A HREF="http://somegroovysite.com/">http://somegroovysite.com/</A>&gt; 
</I>
Of course not.  See my quote from the rel=author part of the spec above;
it clearly defines in which way that relationship applies.

Among the set of relationships that rel allows there are relationships
in each direction (both from and towards the current document), but a
given relationship is always unambiguously defined to be in a particular
direction.

&gt;<i> &gt; If there are redundant features that are only used 0.2% of the time,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we should probably remove them, yes. Are there any?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A lot considering that the average website only uses 19 elements[1]
</I>
That simply doesn't follow.  There are many ways in which hundreds of
different elements could be distributed throughout a population such
that each of them are used on more than 0.2% of pages yet the mean
elements per page is 19.
