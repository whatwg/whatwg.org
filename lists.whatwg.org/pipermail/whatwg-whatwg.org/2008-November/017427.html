While it is true that there are to many factors to take into account 
regarding which calendar, which era, etc.
I can also imagine, (just brainstorming here) if I look at this example in 
the spec:
&lt;p&gt;We stopped talking at &lt;time datetime=&quot;2006-09-24 05:00 -7&quot;&gt;5am the next 
morning&lt;/time&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
This means I should also mark up something like this:
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;time datetime=&quot;???&quot;&gt;5 seconds after the big bang&lt;/time&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There are more factors to take into consideration in this example than just 
calendars.
So... Wouldn't it be far more efficient and convinient to have a 
construction by which we can set a &quot;base-date/time&quot;? (something like the 
base-url-thing). That way you can set the date/time to anything at all based 
on a reference-setting. And this reference setting could be anything 
(another calendar, a specific point in time (or perhaps even time-space) or 
a relative reference. I don't think this would have to be dealt with by the 
UA but can be done by scripting.
