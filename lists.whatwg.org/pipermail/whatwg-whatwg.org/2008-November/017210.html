<PRE>The changes look like improvements to me, but I have some questions.

1. Is there any particular reason why step 7 &quot;generate the list of
potential media resources&quot; is done in the synchronous part of the
algorithm? Would it for example be an error to consider playing sources
added in a loadstart event handler? As it stands one would have to
actually make a list of candidate URLS and pixel ratio overrides &quot;up
front&quot;. I don't really object, I just want to confirm that this is
intentional.

2. Did you remove canPlayType? It was added in
<A HREF="http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=2331&amp;to=2332">http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=2331&amp;to=2332</A> and now it
seems to be gone, but I can't find the revision in which that happened.

3. MEDIA_ERR_DECODE isn't just for corrupted data. If &lt;source
type=&quot;application/ogg&quot;&gt; is given and the browser doesn't &quot;know it cannot
render&quot; it but it turns out that it couldn't decode any of the content
(perhaps it was Ogg FLAC), isn't MEDIA_ERR_DECODE precisely what should
happen? In other words, the word &quot;corrupted&quot; ought to be &quot;unrecognized&quot;,
&quot;not decodable&quot; or something which doesn't imply that the media resource
itself is at fault.
