Summary:

 * added window.location.resolveURL(). I haven't added it to the Location 
   in Workers -- should I?

 * no other normative changes.

How is a script supposed to know what base URL is used to resolve URLs if

I'm sure it it wasn't.

Maybe.


&gt;<i> - Did it help resolve the confusion?

I believe so; it made dedicated workers much simpler.

</I>
A mixture. Mostly though it would be matter of making people use more 
boiler plate code instead of understanding what they were doing.


&gt;<i> I don't remember any of these discussed here.
</I>
It was discussed here and in person, I believe.


&gt;<i> &gt; Shared workers and dedicated workers are fundamentally different and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have different needs, and we should expose these needs in ways 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optimised for the two cases.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The basic need is that dedicated workers be able to have a two-way 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication channel with their creators, and shared workers be able 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to have a two-way communication with each user of the worker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this argument is false. It is normal for a single API to 
</I>&gt;<i> support multiple use cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Replace Worker with XMLHttpRequest, and we end up with separate 
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces for GET and POST.
</I>
I think the difference between dedicated and shared workers is greater 
than the difference between GET and POST. It's more like the difference 
between audio and video -- and we do have HTMLAudioElement and 
HTMLVideoElement, both inheriting fomr a common base, just like workers.


&gt;<i> &gt; For dedicated workers though that's way more complexity than we want 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to require of authors -- why do they have to listen for a port when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there will always be exactly one? So it makes sense to use
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not true that there will always be one - additional ports can be 
</I>&gt;<i> passed in via postMessage().
</I>
Sure, but that's true regardless of dedicated or shared workers. I'm 
talking about the ports set up by the API itself.


&gt;<i> &gt; Now, we've at this point made the two different already, so as to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simplify the dedicated worker, so we could (and the spec does) make 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the dedicated worker even simpler while we're at it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Returning to the XMLHttpRequest example, we really can combine open() 
</I>&gt;<i> and send() for XMLHttpRequestGET, but not for XMLHttpRequestPOST. 
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, the interfaces can be very different if we try to.
</I>
I wouldn't hold up XMLHttpRequest as an example of good API design. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; So, we end up with what the spec has now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think what we have now is better than making dedicated and shared 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workers superficially the same (as the spec used to be, and as the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people involved in this thread argued was bad) is more confusing for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be more that happy with a separate interface if the objects actually

</I>&gt;<i> interfaces was recently proposed here: shared workers should outlive 
</I>&gt;<i> their creators. This is the sort of difference that would make having a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate API reasonable, in my opinion.
</I>
You don't think that the way that a handle to a shared worker can be 
obtained dynamically without contact with the original creator is enough 
of a difference? It's a pretty big functional difference IMHO!


&gt;<i> &gt; At this point, if the only arguments for changing the API are &quot;it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confusing for authors&quot;, then I'd rather not change the API. We got to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where we are today by carefully considering what would be better for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authors. We could continue going back-and-forth and reverting earlier 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions until the cows come home, but I see no benefit to doing so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it's inappropriate to continue back-and-forth until there 
</I>&gt;<i> is at least one reasonably complete implementation validating the spec. 
</I>
I'm happy to change the spec based on good reasons, but I don't want to 
change the spec because &quot;it's confusing&quot; when both alternatives have 
people claiming that they are confusing.

Defining a timeout in seconds makes no sense, since it would mean

</I>
It may be possible to deal with no cleanup, but that doesn't mean it's 
optimal. For example, the server might be keeping some resources around 
for each client, with a timeout that expires after an hour of inactivity. 
But that doesn't mean that it's not better to tell the server &quot;by the way, 
I'm closing now, so you can release those resources&quot;.


&gt;<i> Offering a cleanup window of uncertain length is somewhat pointless and 
</I>&gt;<i> bound to cause incompatibilities across UAs.
</I>
This argument is, as noted, demonstrably false, because we already have 
script running under a timeout window everywhere today, and it doesn't 
cause great problems.


&gt;<i> Is there a strong argument against making 0 seconds mandatory, given

Yes, as noted above.

It doesn't, no. Indeed start() is there mainly for that case (so that 
you can register multiple listeners and then start it).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In an async processing model, there is simply no way for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; receiver to have a list of all objects that were posted to it - it's

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; delivered. For example, in a multi-process implementation, these 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; events may still be across process boundary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It actually doesn't really matter if there is something that has been

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as I can tell) from the case of the worker having shut down a split 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; second before that object was posted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what state you mean by &quot;shut down&quot; here - the spec does not 
</I>&gt;<i> define this, and shutting down a side of an async communication channel 
</I>&gt;<i> is complicated (see e.g. a TCP/IP state diagram). Anyway, the contents 
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;the worker's ports&quot; is used for defining &quot;active needed worker&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;suspendable worker&quot; further on, which are concepts that are very 
</I>&gt;<i> important for worker lifetime definition. If the ports in event queue 
</I>&gt;<i> are not important, then the spec should not say that they are included 
</I>&gt;<i> in &quot;the worker's ports&quot;. This would resolve the concurrency problem, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that the resulting behavior would be desirable.
</I>
If we remove the requirement altogether then, as you say, the behaviour 
would be undesireable (most notably, a worker would instantly garbage 
collect when created).

However, I don't see the problem with the requirement. If an event is 
still not across the process boundary, then the worker will still be kept 
alive by the port over which the new port is being sent. The only way a 
port can be added to the list when the list would otherwise be empty is 
during the creation of a shared worker, but that is all done with a lot 
more marshalling so that if the worker exists, it will be used (and won't 
GC), and if it doesn't, a new one will be created, without a race 
condition.

I guess I could stop mentioning that queued ports are part of the list. It 
might remove the confusion. I've commented it out for now. I don't think 
this makes a practical difference.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It is not possible to have a symmetric relationship in an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; asynchronous messaging model - we need a multi-step 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; entagling/unentangling protocol, so the relationship is necessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; asymmetric. One can't freeze another process (or really, even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; another thread) to change something in it synchronously.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The above is not a requirement, it's just a description of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept. I don't think anything actually depends on it being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; symmetric; all the parts that actually entangle ports have (or, are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intended to have, maybe I missed some) pretty well-defined 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronisation points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, say there is a pair of entangled ports in different 
</I>&gt;<i> threads/processes, portA and portB. We concurrently post both with 
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage, which causes the ports to be cloned. From the point of view 
</I>&gt;<i> of first thread, PortA is now unentangled, and portA' is entangled with 
</I>&gt;<i> portB. From the point of view of second thread, PortB is unentangled, 
</I>&gt;<i> and portB' is entangled with portA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next, threads send asynchronous notifications to each other, asking to 
</I>&gt;<i> update entangling information. First thread's notification asks portB to 
</I>&gt;<i> become entangled with portA'. So, portB will need to forward this 
</I>&gt;<i> notification to portB' (and possibly further, because portB' may have 
</I>&gt;<i> been posted and cloned again). This already is unduly complicated.
</I>
The complication here seems to be in the way you are implementing this. 
Port entangling should be atomic across threads -- when you are sending a 
port over another channel, you should block both threads, create the new 
object, update the information, shunt all pending messages over, and then 
resume the threads. If you implement the actual IPC using, say, a Unix 
socket, then you can just pass the actual socket along and do the same 
thing without blocking. Either way, the point is that as soon as the port 
is passed to another thread, the original thread (and MessagePort object) 
are dead, and would never receive messages.


&gt;<i> Now consider that all these ports need to have destroyed sooner or 
</I>&gt;<i> later, but not too soon. This basically means that we now have a 
</I>&gt;<i> many-to-many distributed GC system. It was bad enough when we had to 
</I>&gt;<i> garbage protect ports between threads, because this required 
</I>&gt;<i> modification of the JavaScript interpreter to support a certain case of 
</I>&gt;<i> distributed GC. But this example basically shows that we need a 
</I>&gt;<i> full-blown distributed GC system in order to implement port cloning.
</I>
I agree that if you implement this by having the threads themselves act as 
proxies to the ports that you end up with all kinds of crazy problems.


&gt;<i> &gt; For example, any method that entangles two ports blocks until both 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; threads are synchronised and entangled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will cause deadlocks - if portB' is sent to the first thread as 
</I>&gt;<i> portB'' in the above scheme, the lock will not let synchronization ever 
</I>&gt;<i> finish.
</I>
Could you elaborate on this? I'm not sure I follow what you mean. If you 
mean that two ports in two threads are posted to each other's threads at 
the same time, then deadlock would only happen in a naive implementation 
that didn't keep pumping its message queue while waiting for a response 
from the other thread. Instead what you would want to do is to ask for a 
semaphore to communicate with the other thread, and if you don't get it, 
see if anyone wants to communicate with you, and if they do, let them do 
whatever they want, and then try again.

Sure, it's not simple. But it's a whole lot better than proxying messages 
around using an &quot;address change&quot; mechanism like the post office, where one 
could easily imagine a message chasing the port through multiple threads 
desperately trying to catch up with the port so it could actually be 
delivered!

(Personally I would prefer passing sockets around.)


&gt;<i> &gt; (The spec is somewhat implicit about this, but the intent is that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workers really be implemented either as two system threads, one doing

I'm certainly open to changing the algorithms around if a better solution 
exists in a manner that gets the same behavior. I'm certainly no expert on 
the topic (as I'm sure the above responses have shown).

</I>&gt;<i> lot of use in MessagePorts if they cannot be passed around.
</I>
I agree with the latter. I'm not sure how to do the former.

I did a lot of research when speccing Navigator, and ended up with:

  readonly attribute DOMString appName;
  readonly attribute DOMString appVersion;
  readonly attribute DOMString platform;
  readonly attribute DOMString userAgent;

This excludes anything that is not implemented in three or more browsers, 
and excludes anything that always returns a constant regardless of 
browser. I may add more as people find reasons to add the others.
