That's rather confusing, and a pretty good reason not to have a way to go 
from the current default path to an explicit Path, IMHO.

Transformations affect the building of the current default path at each 
step of the way, which is really a very confusing API. The Path API on the 
other hand doesn't have this problem -- it has no transformation matrix. 
It's only when you use Path objects that they get transformed.


&gt;<i> &gt; So this is not how most implementations currently have it defined.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm unsure what you mean. Browser implementations? If so, they 
</I>&gt;<i> definitely do store the path in user coordinates. The spec currently

</I>
I'm not sure what you're referring to here.


&gt;<i> It would be a very fast way to set a cached path in the graphics state
</I>
What would the purpose of this be? You can just pass the path to the 
relevant functions instead, no?


&gt;<i> Another use case is to allow authors to quickly migrate to hit regions.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To migrate that to a region (with my proposed shape interface [1]):

</I>&gt;<i> Shape(ctx.currentPath, ctx.currentDrawingStyle));
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ctx.addHitRegion({shape: s, id: &quot;control&quot;});
</I>
Why not just add ctx.addHitRegion() calls after the fill and stroke calls?

I don't really understand the use case here.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can you elaborate on how exactly you would want this to work? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How would you avoid the alignment and distortion problems when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; applying this to anything less trivial than a rectangle?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, this would *just* move the control points and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; width of paths so the strokes are always aligned to the pixel 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grid (This would take pixel density and transformations into 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; account). After this, you would draw as usual.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Can you define &quot;aligned to the pixel grid&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; If I have a line from x1,y to x2,y, followed by an arc from x2,y 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; back to x1,y with radius r, what should happen and why?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Align the anchor points of all the segments. Don't change any of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anti-aliasing behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How does this differ from simply always using integers for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coordinates?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would simplify the process for the developer as it might be difficult 
</I>&gt;<i> to determine what an &quot;integer&quot; coordinate is, especially if there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> complex CTM in effect. For instance, if the scale is .5, you'd have to 
</I>&gt;<i> round to a multiple of 2.
</I>
I don't really understand when the snapping happens in this proposal. 
Consider a rotation transformation matrix. How exactly does the snapping 
work? In a space that's transformed by 45 degress, how would lines drawn 
at 44, 45, and 46 degrees to the horizontal, all starting at the same 
point, end up being rendered?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What if they're draw as separate paths?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm unsure if I follow. That shouldn't make a different. What might 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be different however, is if you draw a diagonal line in 1 segment or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2 since the middle point will be aligned to the grid in the latter 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Consider a case like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    <A HREF="http://goo.gl/VFsLqj">http://goo.gl/VFsLqj</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do you keep the diagonal line exactly touching the arc?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You would not :-) If the pixel that would cover over 50%, it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> filled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the developer is interested in geometric precision, he shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> request sharp lines.
</I>
I think there's a difference between being &quot;interested in geometric 
precision&quot; and interested in things not being ugly. In fact, I don't 
really see when you would want sharp lines, but _not_ want them to 
necessarily line up in a tight-fitting manner.


&gt;<i> &gt; You can do unions and so forth with just paths, no need for regions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How would you do a union with paths?
</I>&gt;<i> If you mean that you can just aggregate the segments, sure but that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem very useful.
</I>
You say, here are some paths, here are some fill rules, here are some 
operations you should perform, now give me back a path that describes the 
result given a particular fill rule.

A shape is just a path with a fill rule, essentially. Anything you can do 
with one you can do with the other.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The path object should represent the path in the graphics state. You 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can't add a stroked path or text outline to the graphics state and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; then fill/stroke it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As designed today, you could fill it, as long as you use non-zero 
</I>&gt;<i> winding. If you use even-odd, the results will be very wrong. (ie where 
</I>&gt;<i> joins and line segments meet, there will be white regions)
</I>
I think &quot;wrong&quot; here implies a value judgement that's unwarranted.


&gt;<i> Stroking will be completely wrong too, because joins and end caps are 
</I>&gt;<i> drawn separately, so they would be stroked as separate paths. This will 
</I>&gt;<i> not give you the effect of a double-stroked path.
</I>
I don't understand why you think joins and end caps are drawn separately. 
That is not what the spec requires.


&gt;<i> &gt; We seem to be going around in circles. We're in agreement that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually we should add APIs for combining paths such that we get the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equivalent of the union of their fill regions. I agree that converting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text into paths is non-trivial (lots of stuff browsers do is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-trivial, that's kind of the point -- if it was trivial, we could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leave it for authors). But I don't see how we get from there to you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wanting the existing APIs removed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want them removed because they will most likely not behave in the way 
</I>&gt;<i> that an author expects. When he &quot;adds&quot; 2 paths, he wouldn't expect that 
</I>&gt;<i> there is 'interference' between them.
</I>
I don't see why not. It's exactly what happens today if you were to just 
add the same path creation statements together into the current default 
path and fill or stroke that.


&gt;<i> &gt; The only methods for which the spec currently requires user agents to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ensure that they create only paths that wind clockwise, and for which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this has any practical impact as far as I can tell, are the Path 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods addText(), addPathByStrokingText(), and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addPathByStrokingPath().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> don't forget tracing a path.
</I>
That's addPathByStrokingPath(). (stroke() is essentially just 
addPathByStrokingText() followed by a fill().)

That's not a use case, it's just a different way of implementing the same 
use case. Why is it better? It seems distinctly more awkward and less 
idiomatic to have to set an implicit property and then call a method, than 
just call the method with the path.

Analogously, we don't say:

   Math.angle = Math.PI * 3;
   var x = Math.sin();

...we say:

   var x = Math.sin(Math.PI * 3);


&gt;<i> It also make it more intuitive since you can call:

</I>
I don't understand how that is intuitive. Why would you do this?

Without compelling use cases, I don't think we should add these features.

That's how you get a point -- scale(0,0) essentially reverts everything to

I'm not arguing that it's better, just that's it's defined. We went

When making proposals, it's better to start from use cases and then

Without knowing what the use cases are, it's hard to evaluate the

Not really. The Path object has many features that need browser support:

 - filling or stroking a path doesn't blow away the current default path
 - paths can be stroked then further manipulated
 - text can be added to a Path and then manipulated
 - text can be added to a Path in a way that follows a Path

None of these features can be done with the non-Path API in JS.


&gt;<i> The Path APIs are simply containers of path segments with no drawing

</I>&gt;<i> drawing time and since those are expensive to resolve, they might impact

</I>
UAs can certainly pre-compute anything, or cache anything, that would be 
expensive. In particular, I would expect a browser to cache the expensive 
aspects of filling a Path, since that Path will most likely be filled 
again in the future. That's kind of the point of Path.

If there's specific optimisations that can't be done with Path, do bring 
them up, though. That's the kind of use case information that is useful.

Couldn't the same be done with Path object? e.g. WebGL could have some 
object that you construct from a path and fill rule, which you can then 
reuse in a WebGL context.

Can you elaborate on the DisplatList part of this? Would this need to be

This really is just removing the addPathByStrokingText() method and 
splitting the overloaded addText() method into addText() and 
addTextAlongPath(), right?

Since people have started implementing this now, I've also now added a 
constructor that builds a path from a bunch of other paths and a fill 
rule, and creates a new (fill-rule-agnostic) path that is the &quot;union&quot;, 
shape-wise, of the input paths.


&gt;<i> The functionality of the addPathByStrokingText methods below can be done by
</I>&gt;<i> applying the above methods.
</I>
Yeah, the addPathByStrokingText() method is just intended to allow you to 
render text outlines without having to go through two Paths. It's purely a 
convenience method. Happy to drop it if implementors don't think it's 
worth it.

They interact in exactly the ways that they do with the current default 
path. It's just like concatenating the path creation method calls.

I agree that once that is deployed we should add a method to create a path 
from other paths in a way that causes the new path to describe the union 
of the fill regions of the original paths (given some fill rule).

The solution to that is to fix the browsers.

This drops the ability to stroke a path, which seems like a major loss, as 
well as the ability to draw text along a path, which would be rather 
disappointing (and is one of the things authors kept asking for).

We can't drop the CanvasDrawingStyles argument since that's what specifies 
the font.

Good point. I've changed the algorithm a bit so that the resulting path

I don't think the arguments for removing these are compelling. The 
problems with the APIs have been addressed (e.g. there's no ambiguity in 
the case of overlapping text), the use cases are clear (e.g. drawing text 
around an arc or drawing a label along a line graph's line), and the API 
now supports the constructs to do unions of fill regions.

These methods have been very stable. They have barely changed since they 
were added, except for some minor tweaks to fix bugs.

I don't understand why this needs to be done ahead of time. Just cache the

optimal form at that time.

I don't understand why you need to decode/re-encode. Just &quot;compile&quot; the

Why would you re-encode? If you've already used the path with a backend,

If the backend changes, knowing the backend at creation time doesn't help.

If it doesn't, then the cost seems to be the same either way.
