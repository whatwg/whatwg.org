<PRE>Let me point out that not every calendar uses simple 2-4 digit numbers to denote years.

The Japanese era name calendar system, for example, requires an era name such as Showa and Heisei associated with each year.

For example, I was born in Gregorian year 1986 but any Japanese government document would say I was born in Showa 61.  My brother was born in 1989 but, again, he must write &quot;Heisei 1&quot; instead on any government form.

There are also even quite few banks and other organizations in Japan that use the era name system for various forms and documents.

</I>&gt;<i> Mathematically, you are right, but input types aren't based on general properties of quantities but on practical classification of input data. All the examples I gave, including year numbers, are normally input by typing the digits - in contrast with, say, using a color picker, a data picker, or a slider. And year numbers differ, as mentioned, from normal numbers as regards to conventional formats (e.g., 2014 vs. 2,014 or 2'014 or 2 014 or...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in the input process, a year number is not treated like a number. It typically appears when asking for year of birth or some other event (marriage, employment, etc.). The input check is normally against any non-digit data, the kind of thing we can do with pattern=...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Logically, one might say that since asking for a year is very often an alternative to asking for more specific data such as month or day, it should be treated as &quot;date and time input&quot; rather than text input with restrictions. But I don't see how this would be practically relevant. What else could &lt;input type=year&gt; be other than reading some digits? There is the possibility of allowing two-digit numbers, with an implied century, but if that is desirable, authors can use &lt;input type=text pattern=\d{4}|\d{2} and deal with the implied century in their own code.
