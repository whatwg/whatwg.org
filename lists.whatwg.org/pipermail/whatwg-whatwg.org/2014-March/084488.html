<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can do unions and so forth with just paths, no need for regions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How would you do a union with paths?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you mean that you can just aggregate the segments, sure but that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seem very useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You say, here are some paths, here are some fill rules, here are some
</I>&gt;<i> operations you should perform, now give me back a path that describes the
</I>&gt;<i> result given a particular fill rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think your collapsing a couple of different concepts here:

path + fillrule -&gt; shape
union of shapes -&gt; shape
shape can be converted to a path



&gt;<i> A shape is just a path with a fill rule, essentially.
</I>

So, a path can now have a fillrule? Sorry, that makes no sense.
A path is just a set of segments; there should be no magic


&gt;<i> Anything you can do
</I>&gt;<i> with one you can do with the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No.
You can't add segments from one shape to another as shapes represent
regions.
Likewise, you can't union, intersect or xor path segments.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The path object should represent the path in the graphics state. You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; can't add a stroked path or text outline to the graphics state and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; then fill/stroke it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As designed today, you could fill it, as long as you use non-zero
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; winding. If you use even-odd, the results will be very wrong. (ie where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; joins and line segments meet, there will be white regions)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think &quot;wrong&quot; here implies a value judgement that's unwarranted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;Wrong&quot; meaning:
 if the author has a bunch of geometry and wants to put it in 1 path object
so he can just execute 1 fill operation, he might be under the impression
that &quot;adding&quot; the geometry will just work.
There are very few use cases where you want to add partial path segments
together but I agree that there are some cases that it's useful to have.


&gt;<i> &gt; Stroking will be completely wrong too, because joins and end caps are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drawn separately, so they would be stroked as separate paths. This will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not give you the effect of a double-stroked path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why you think joins and end caps are drawn separately.
</I>&gt;<i> That is not what the spec requires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure it does, for instance from
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#trace-a-path">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#trace-a-path</A>
:<i>
</I>
The round value means that a filled arc connecting the two aforementioned
corners of the join, abutting (and not overlapping) the aforementioned
triangle, with the diameter equal to the line width and the origin at the
point of the join, must be added at joins.


If you mean, &quot;drawn with a separate fill call&quot;, yes that is true.
What I meant was that they are drawn as a separate closed path that will
interact with other paths as soon as there are different winding rules or
&quot;holes&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We seem to be going around in circles. We're in agreement that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; eventually we should add APIs for combining paths such that we get the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; equivalent of the union of their fill regions. I agree that converting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; text into paths is non-trivial (lots of stuff browsers do is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; non-trivial, that's kind of the point -- if it was trivial, we could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; leave it for authors). But I don't see how we get from there to you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; wanting the existing APIs removed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I want them removed because they will most likely not behave in the way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that an author expects. When he &quot;adds&quot; 2 paths, he wouldn't expect that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is 'interference' between them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why not. It's exactly what happens today if you were to just
</I>&gt;<i> add the same path creation statements together into the current default
</I>&gt;<i> path and fill or stroke that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure but who does that?
These two operations don't look the same:

 ...// draw geometry A

ctx.fill();

...// draw geometry B

ctx.fill();

and

...// draw geometry A
...// draw geometry B
ctx.fill();



&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The only methods for which the spec currently requires user agents to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ensure that they create only paths that wind clockwise, and for which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this has any practical impact as far as I can tell, are the Path
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; methods addText(), addPathByStrokingText(), and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; addPathByStrokingPath().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't forget tracing a path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's addPathByStrokingPath(). (stroke() is essentially just
</I>&gt;<i> addPathByStrokingText() followed by a fill().)

Not sure what's non-trivial about this.
Any transform will be applied in reverse to the existing path.

Just to be sure, these 2 fill calls should look different, right?

var p = new Path2D();
p.rect(0,0,10,10);

ctx.fill(p);

ctx.scale(2,2);

ctx.fill(p);

We've gone over this several times now.
The APIs that you define, have use cases and I agree with them.
However the way you defined those APIs does not make sense and will not

Great! (see

the changed algorithm)
What you specified there is called &quot;planarization&quot;. This is when you
calculate the intersections within and between closed shapes and remove the
line segments that are filled on both sides.
By specifying this:

The subpaths in merged path must be oriented such that for any point, the
number of times a half-infinite straight line drawn from that point crosses
a subpath is even if and only if the number of times a half-infinite
straight line drawn from that same point crosses a subpath going in one
direction is equal to the number of times it crosses a subpath going in the
other direction.

and relying on segment removal, you also get the same fill behavior for
even-odd. (Meaning that the end result can be used with either winding rule)
This is not something that is needed for just text but also when you do a
union of shapes.

The bad news is that this algorithm is very expensive and there are few
libraries that do a decent job (I only know of 1).
So, it's not realistic to add this to the Path2D object.
The reason for that is that even though a UA could emulate the union by
doing multiple fill operations, Path2D allows you to stroke another path
object. At that point, you really have to do planarization. By defining a
Shape2D object and not allowing it to be stroked, we can work around this.
