<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> As I noted above, what we need to know (and I guess we need to know this from all browsers) if there's a *guarantee* of a-&gt;b-&gt;c execution order (even if all 3 are executing async)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe there is such a guarantee, unless the spec spells it out 
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly.
</I>

The `async=false` stuff in the spec talks about dynamically loaded (not parser loaded) scripts going into a queue so they are downloaded in parallel, but executed in request-order from the queue.

So, in my aforementioned `execScript(..)` function, if it also set `s.async = false`, I believe that would opt all of the scripts into the async queue.

function execScript(l) {
  var s = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
  s.async = false; // &lt;-- insert this to get ordered-async
  s.src = l.href;
  document.head.appendChild(s);
  return s.loaded();
}

Even though all of them would, at that point, be strictly loading from cache, it should still have the effect of ensuring they execute strictly in a-&gt;b-&gt;c order, correct?

One downside to this is that there were use-cases where the single &quot;queue&quot; that this spec mechanism created were not sufficient, such as loading a group of scripts for widget A and another independent group of scripts widget B, and not wanting A or B to block the other.

If all of those scripts were set with `async=false` and thus all put in that single queue, widget A's scripts could block widget B's scripts, which sorta fails that use-case.

However, it would probably only be a slight delay, as you wouldn't (in the previously mentioned code pattern) add the &lt;script&gt; elements to the DOM (and thus the queue) until after all the &lt;link rel=preload&gt;'s had finished loading, so it would only be parsing/execution that blocked, not downloading.

Execution is already an implicit blocking, as the engine can only run one script at a time, so actually, it's just a concern of potential parsing blocking other parsing.

The question is whether `async=false` scripts in the queue can be parsed in parallel (unblocked from each other) on the background threads, as you said, or whether being in that async=false queue means that both parsing and execution happen &quot;in order&quot;, and thus could cause long parsing of widget A's scripts from blocking parsing of widget B's scripts?

However you slice it, I think it would cause *some* delays between widget A and B (aka, not totally independent), but it would in general be far less delays than what we have currently, which is that downloading blocks in that queue. So that seems like a big (if not complete) win. :)
