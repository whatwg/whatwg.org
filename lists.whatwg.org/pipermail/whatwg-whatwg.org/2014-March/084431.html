</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that throwing an exception makes sense in this case because it

</I>&gt;<i>  But since Firefox is already throwing an exception in this case, I would

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe I wasn't very clear. The exception on Firefox happens when you try to
use the text API, not when you try to create the context.

For question 2) I really don't have a strong opinion.  On some level, being
&gt;<i> more restrictive feels safer and more future proof, but would it be
</I>&gt;<i> overkill in this case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Since the canvas element can be transferred to a browser context-less
document, throwing an exception at creation time won't work.
It seems best to disallow the API that rely on the browser context which as
far as we know are the text APIs.


&gt;<i> As far as Path2D text methods are concerned, I don't see any problems. the
</I>&gt;<i> resolution of CanvasDrawingStyles can be deferred to rasterization time, at
</I>&gt;<i> which point we can use the browsing context of the canvas to which the path
</I>&gt;<i> is being drawn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe... the point of the path API is to help with performance. If they are
designed in such a way that the actual processing happens when they are
used, performance will be impacted.
