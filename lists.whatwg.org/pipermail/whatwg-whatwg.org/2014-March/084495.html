Do you need bicubic filtering specifically, or would any high quality 
resizing algorithm work for you?

If the bug is that Chrome resamples the image in an ugly way, then that's 
a bug with Chrome. As the bug says, browsers are allowed to pick whatever 
algorithm they want -- it's a quality-of-implementation issue. But if the 
result is ugly, that's a low quality implementation.

Well, when scaling down, nearest-neighbor interpolation doesn't make 
sense. So the &quot;false&quot; value doesn't really make sense when scaling down. 
So browsers have to pick an algorithm. Which they pick (and how it's 
implemented, etc) decides the quality of their implementation.

This is why the spec currently doesn't specify an algorithm.

That's a quality-of-implementation bug with the browsers, not a spec bug.
