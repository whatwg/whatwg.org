<PRE>On windows with smoothing disabled I get it in every browser except
Chrome. Maybe this is due to Direct2D, and for some reason it
antialiases the edges of the bitmaps? It's nice to hear that it
doesn't happen on other configurations.

It's important to test this when drawing with transforms active because
you may not see the full set of artifacts without them. (The application
where I first observed this is rotating/scaling these bitmaps with
scaling disabled.)

Copying to a temporary canvas is an interesting idea; is it possible for
typical browser implementations to optimize this or does it forcibly
degrade things to a pair of individual draw calls (with full state changes
and 6-vertex buffers) for every bitmap rendered?

I don't really have any problems with the behavior when smoothing is
enabled; sorry if this was unclear.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ah. I remember looking at your test case.
</I>&gt;<i> I made a simpler version that shows the issue:

</I>&gt;<i> According to the spec, there should be a faint line [1]:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the original image data is a bitmap image, the value painted at a point
</I>&gt;<i> in the destination rectangle is computed by filtering the original image
</I>&gt;<i> data. The user agent may use any filtering algorithm (for example bilinear
</I>&gt;<i> interpolation or nearest-neighbor). When the filtering algorithm requires a
</I>&gt;<i> pixel value from outside the original image data, it must instead use the
</I>&gt;<i> value from the nearest edge pixel. (That is, the filter uses 'clamp-to-edge'
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.) When the filtering algorithm requires a pixel value from outside
</I>&gt;<i> the source rectangle but inside the original image data, then the value from
</I>&gt;<i> the original image data must be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You were told correctly that the Chrome behavior is incorrect. When doing
</I>&gt;<i> smoothing, Chrome is not looking outside the bounds of the source image, so
</I>&gt;<i> you don't get the faint line.
</I>&gt;<i> This is also an issue with the cairo and core graphics backends of Firefox.
</I>&gt;<i> Safari and IE seem to work correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will log bugs against Chrome and Firefox so we can get interoperable
</I>&gt;<i> behavior here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was not able to reproduce the issue of smoothing was disabled. If you want
</I>&gt;<i> smoothing but not the lines, you can do a drawimage to an intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> canvas with the same resolution as the source canvas. I verified that this
