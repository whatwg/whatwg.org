<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> We probably know the [list of link types] from HTML 4.01[1] and I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think that list should be extended by WHATWG for HTML 5.0. Besides  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extending the current list of values,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why does the list need extending? The current list already includes  
</I>&gt;<i> redundant items. For example, having &quot;chapter&quot;, &quot;section&quot;, and  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;subsection&quot; has the same lack of scalability as the fixed &lt;h1&gt;~&lt;h6&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy we have already tried to get away from. And the distinction  
</I>&gt;<i> between &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Contents&quot;, if it was heeded at all, would  
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily encourage the existence of splash pages (rather than  
</I>&gt;<i> having a site's table of contents on its front page).
</I>
A yes, 'section' and 'subsection' are indeed a problem. They are quite 
useful though and I can't think of something that could replace them. 
'start' and 'contents' are different. 'start' defines where search 
engines should start indexing, typically at the root of the site, '/' 
and contents is the same as 'toc' or table of contents, which probably 
has a different URI.


&gt;<i> The presence of redundant items doesn't mean the list shouldn't be  
</I>&gt;<i> extended, but it does mean good reasons should be provided for each new  
</I>&gt;<i> item. Each addition complicates both the spec and its implementations.
</I>
Agreed. They should be specified with detail as well. So it is very 
clear where you should use them and where not.


&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also think that we should change &quot;user agents may provide access to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linked documents through a navigation bar&quot; to 'should', since they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only useful if UAs do something with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, &quot;do something with it&quot; is not necessarily &quot;provide access to&quot; it;  
</I>&gt;<i> that would be inappropriate for rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; and rel=&quot;icon&quot;. But in  
</I>&gt;<i> general, yes, links are pretty useless if UAs don't expose them.
</I>
Agreed. (|rel=&quot;alternate stylesheet&quot;| should have UI of course, but that 
is pretty obvious.)


&gt;<i> For &lt;a rel&gt;, it doesn't matter so much, since current UAs display the  
</I>&gt;<i> link noticably and reliably anyway. But except for Lynx, current UAs  
</I>&gt;<i> don't render &lt;link&gt; noticably and reliably, making it pretty useless.
</I>
It would be nice if the UA would have some kind of build in shortcuts 
for &lt;a rel=&quot;next&quot;&gt; to name an example. If I read a document and press 
'ctrl+n' the UA would spider (of already has spidered and indexed) the 
document to look for all |rel=&quot;next&quot;| and returns a list of possible 
locations. If there is only a single location the UA would take me there 
immediatly.

I guess such mechanisms should apply to both A and LINK elements.
