Maybe, maybe not. That depends on the situation and how agnostic the  
solution is.

&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;, &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; all have

</I>
Probably not, but there's a good reason these are replaced with more  
generic non-representative names in XForms, namely the 'select', 'select1'  
and 'trigger' elements.

&gt;<i> That it has made different people on this list think of dials and  
</I>&gt;<i> speedometers, or &quot;an indicator just like a progress bar&quot;, suggests that  
</I>&gt;<i> it does not imply any particular presentation.
</I>
I can agree with this. The word &#171;gauge&#187; doesn't bring any particular  
presentation to my mind. Its function (to measure something) is what I  
think of, not how something is measured or how the measure is presented.

&gt;<i> Not at all. Progress meters are often used outside of status bars, in  
</I>&gt;<i> situations where a status bar would be too feeble (for example, an  
</I>&gt;<i> upload or download utility that needs a large progress meter because the  
</I>&gt;<i> task is going to take hours so you may be keeping an eye on it from a  
</I>&gt;<i> distance) or too single (any application where multiple simultaneous but  
</I>&gt;<i> unrelated tasks are represented by multiple progress meters).
</I>
I agree with this as well. Status bars aren't the same as progress bars.  
Status bars can be used to notify the user of the progress of a given  
task, but often status bars display information that has absolutely  
nothing to to with progress.
