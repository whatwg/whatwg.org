<PRE>
The various proposals for data formatting basically boiled down to two 
requests:

 1. That there be a way to take the value entered in a form control, and 
    format it specially when the form control doesn't have focus, in 
    particular to handle number fields which may need to be thousands-
    separated or have a currency symbol introduced,

 2. That there be a way to format data (times and dates, numbers) such 
    that it can be placed into markup in raw form and reformatted on the 
    fly in a similar way.

In the case of WF2, that's intentional, since implementors need to give us 
feedback on what issues they run into with making the controls work.


&gt;<i> numbers
</I>&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;<i> because javascript/ecmascript only respects US/english style numbers it is
</I>&gt;<i> unreasonable to ask the spec to allow/validate european style numbers (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 1.000.000,00) but it should at least provide a mechanism for displaying
</I>&gt;<i> numbers in this format (it's only polite).
</I>
For number fields, it would seem likely that the UA would just do that 
automatically, we shouldn't have to say anything about it.


&gt;<i> dates
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i> i don't want my english style date converted to a US style date when submitted
</I>&gt;<i> to the server (especially if i'm booking a plane). after tabbing out of a date
</I>&gt;<i> field, if my date entry is formatted (e.g. 30 Jul 2004) then i *know* i've
</I>&gt;<i> entered the right information.
</I>
Same with dates, IMHO.


&gt;<i> currencies
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i> a large proportion of forms data is about money (true). again the feedback

</I>&gt;<i> immediate feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> i also humbly suggest adding another input type - &quot;currency&quot;. without a format
</I>&gt;<i> attribute this is meaningless. it's just a number. however, with a format
</I>&gt;<i> attribute it becomes a more meaningful (and ubiquitous) kind of number. if the
</I>&gt;<i> models for web apps are amazon and paypal then they may be interested in a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;currency&quot; input type (with appropriate formatting to the locale). if we don't
</I>&gt;<i> have a new input type then perhaps a named format &quot;currency&quot; will suffice.
</I>
Since money is just a number, I would be more comfortable with:

   &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; currency=&quot;...&quot;&gt;

...or similar. This also has the advantage that we can introduce it in WF3 
and WF2 UAs will still be compatible with it.

</I>
Well, the idea is that the _UA_ would do the reformatting automatically. 
For most types, it can. It's only really currencies (of the ones mentioned 
so far, anyway) that have special formatting rules that the UA can't 
guess.

Well, currencies can't just be naively localised, because you never know 
what currency you might be actually dealing with.

For &lt;output&gt;, the latter might make sense; the former IMHO wouldn't.

How would you do it? Assuming you want the currency symbol to appear in

Right. For currencies, it makes sense.

I wouldn't say it was &quot;nonsense&quot; -- who knows what MapQuest want. But 
yeah, I agree that as a user I would want it to use my locale settings.

Since WF2 has no specific telephone field, that would be up to the server.

In WF2 your UA would pick the locale format.


&gt;<i> If that doesn't break the validation, the accented characters in my

WF2 supports that without any problems, in theory.


&gt;<i> And so on. Where does the zip/post code go?

Again, not a WF2 problem as far as I can see.


&gt;<i> What would you deduce from the lang attribute of this mail??

I think the localisation should use the OS settings, not the language of 
anything.

</I>
I don't really see how we can make it better. :-)

Suggestions are welcome of course.

I don't expect to start work on WC1 for a _long_ time.

I hesitate to call this stylistic, to be honest. Even without stylesheets,
you're still going to want dates, times, etc, to be localised.

I really know nothing about alternate calendars. If we're to add stuff 
like this, IMHO we can only really do it with input from people who use 
such systems on a daily basis online.

I think number fields could be expected to do this natively too.

Some systems are more complex (resistance notation, e.g.).

I presume we could say that if the iso attribute is omitted, it takes the 
value from the contents of the element.

That seems reasonable to me.




So my conclusion is we should wait for WF3, but then:

  * Add something to type=&quot;number&quot; to support basic currency and unit 
    formatting of input

  * Add something like &lt;date&gt;, &lt;time&gt;, and &lt;number&gt; so that dates, times,
    and numbers can be auto-formatted.
