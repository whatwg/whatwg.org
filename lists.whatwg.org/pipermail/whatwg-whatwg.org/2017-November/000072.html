<PRE>On webites that either are age restricted and/or have content that may 
be offensive to some people, often (but not as often as I'd like) there 
is a warning splashscreen that the server puts in the page if the user 
has not already agreed to see such content.

One way to do this is with a div that has absolute positioning and a 
z-index that covers the content until the user clicks enter or whatever, 
then it does an ajax call to lett the server the user has verified they 
want to see the content and removes the div.

I would suggest a tagName &quot;splashscreen&quot; for this purpose. It would have 
the same properties as a div only it would have semantic meaning so that 
people using screen readers would know it is important.

An aria landmark of splashscreen would also properly distinguish it from 
complementary which is what I currently use for it (I would use banner 
but only one banner landmark per page is allowed).

Just a thought, I won't defend the thought but if it seems reasonable to 
the powers that be, I think it is worth it.

These splash screens do serve a different purpose than any other 
semantic tag.
</PRE>
