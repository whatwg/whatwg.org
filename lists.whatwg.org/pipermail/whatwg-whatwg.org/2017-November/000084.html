<PRE>I think libraries having those functions emphasizes the point here, as that
validates the existence and need for those patterns which then raises the
requirement: should this be native to the browser?

I believe the answer is yes, given how much work has already been put into
standardizing the resource/computation model around the browser (web
workers, local storage, etc) which is architecturally, IMHO, a related
effort. Those capabilities come to life when there are smarter ways to
utilize and route work to them through built-in features related to
processing events/messages. In an effort to not create a science project
out of some sort of top-down attack on this requirement, a simple
middle-out approach with immediate results would be to extend the
eventListener behavior that is prevalent in both browser and node.js
scenarios.

The case I am making first and foremost is that these recognizable patterns
will be increasingly requisite (and not an after-thought, to be brought in
via Underscore) in building web apps in the near term as web app complexity
&amp; use has increased dramatically with multiple cloud-scale offerings
running in the SaaS space (think Netflix, LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack, etc)
and more being built in various startups &amp; emerging businesses. If the
browser is to gain parity as an Application Platform allowing the
development of web applications to rival native ones, then the ability to
deal with volatile/durable messaging and events, storage and routing of
work should be a core capability.

*Broader implications:*
If I may, let me add that I also think there is a growing confluence
between the hybrid desktop app and browser-based SPAs (the Electron
framework and its numerous successful projects like Atom, Slack, Visual
Studio Code are great examples) and if the browser is to continue to evolve
as a platform to encourage this trend (which is fabulous for the web
community), then investments must be made to extend / normalize the browser
standards in much the same way that the concept of a standardized
Application Server helped standardize app architectures. This implies a
future with registration of libraries/components (managed code), better
local storage/caching options, improved integration with security contexts
(per O/S), and likely much more. At least, I think it does :-).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Core Problem Statement* Processor functions that subscribe to events via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> topic string may need to be prioritized for processing based on the topic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> itself. Conversely, certain events may be more numerous but should not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limit the ability of the JS environment to respond and process other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> events, that may be more critical to either the User Experience (UX) or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrity of the system (e.g. events that trigger saving data to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back-end).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Background Information* As Browser/CommonJS environments bring paradigms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like UI event handling and back-end event handling into the same problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space, it is useful to apply common patterns used in Message-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Publish-Subscribe environments with message brokers, which is what the JS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execution context often behaves as. The use case here is to ensure that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of event (e.g. event listeners for a &#8216;mouseMove&#8217; event) don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saturate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or delay execution of other events (e.g. &#8216;dataAvailableForAutosave&#8217;) due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> massive differences in event volume or conversely, expensive operations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that block the execution thread in question.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Proposed Solution* Add metering options to the addEventListener
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Options* configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> object. These options control how the JS execution environment controls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throttling/firing of event handler instances in response to events that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> match the topic string of the subscription created by addEventListener.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Proposed options:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - maxInstances [Number / Function] used to decide how many event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    listeners can be invoked before throttling occurs. Throttling does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    events but simply queues them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - throttlingQueueLength [Number] used to maintain an in-memory queue of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    un-processed events per Topic string, after throttling kicks in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - throttlingQueuePolicy [String] Values could be exception - throws an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    exception when the queue length is exceeded, rolling - drops the oldest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    events and pushes newer ones into the queue, expand- allow the queue to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    expand to cover all events.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Additional Options* It might be even more useful if the options allowed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> targeting or creation of Web Workers (or Node child processes, depending
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the execution context) based on the event handler configuration. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially target CPU cores and/or O/S child processes / threads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (depending on the O/S terminology for parallel execution).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Related Thread* The proposal identified in the link below (by &#352;ime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vidas) could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be part of this solution as it defines other metering options around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debounce (which improves scale around event handling, which is in the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem space) and handling throttling through frequency, which should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the alternatives in addition to my proposal above (as I believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are orthogonal): <A HREF="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/add-event-throttlin">https://discourse.wicg.io/t/add-event-throttlin</A>
