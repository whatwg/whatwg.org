No, Glenn's proposal is that each call to document.delayCompletion()
returns an independent delayer object.  The document only finishes
loading when all delayer objects have finished.

It's a closer analogue to the current behavior, described by roc in
the OP.  Rather than a crazy hack that actually hits the network, this
just generates objects whose sole purpose in life is to delay the
document load until they're finished.

&gt;&gt;<i>Both of these APIs are effectively manual resource collection, though,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which makes me nervous.  It's not something the platform is designed for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(hence all the difficulty with blob URLs).  Something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>document.delayUntil(indexedDbTransaction) would be nicer...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That also does address calling `delayUntil(...)` multiple times. And in
</I>&gt;<i> both cases, if multiple calls to either method have to be matched up,
</I>&gt;<i> you end up with the same problem that those multiple calls are hard to

</I>
Hm?  In Glenn's original proposal, there's no difficulty with matching
- each delayer is an object, and you just kill it individually.  In
his suggestion for delayUntil(), there's no matching at all - it
automatically completes as soon as something else completes.

(Perhaps this means we need something that can take a Future, and
delays the document load until that future resolves?  For legacy, it
can take other objects like IDBTransaction, and work analogously.)
