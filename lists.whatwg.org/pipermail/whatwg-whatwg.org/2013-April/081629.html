Why does the test I posted fail, then?

   <A HREF="http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/ui/001.html">http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/ui/001.html</A>

Right-click either frame, and make it display the frame elsewhere (new 
tab, only-this-frame, even view-source is broken on this test in Gecko). 
The new page that's shown is different than the one the user interacted 
with.

This isn't academic, it breaks any case where a frame's contents are 
dynamically generated. For example, an ad system that just uses an iframe 
and generates an appropriate ad each time would open a different ad if you 
were to right-click on it and open the iframe in a new tab.

No. The current spec doesn't even mention these features. It doesn't pick 
anything. Implementing them based on URLs doesn't work in all cases, even 
before srcdoc=&quot;&quot; was introduced.

If you were to implement a &quot;multiply by two&quot; feature by simply shifting 
the input's first byte left by one bit, then it would work great for 
numbers up to 128. It would fail for numbers greater than that. The 
solution is not &quot;well, we should make sure all numbers are less than 128&quot;, 
or &quot;this solution works fine for most numbers that people actually come 
across&quot;. The solution is to use an algorithm that works all the time.

This is a quality-of-implementation issue. There's nothing in the spec 
that means that these features have to use URLs; using URLs is ok for a 
first approximation but it doesn't handle all the cases (even ignoring 
srcdoc). The better implementations would work in all cases (including 
the example above and srcdoc). The less good implementations would not 
work in all cases, or maybe won't offer the feature at all (e.g. Chrome, 
as far as I can tell).
