<PRE>I support this proposal &#173; makes total sense to me. We (Zynga) promise
we'll not misuse the priority channels :)

On 15.03.13 18:57, &quot;Wesley Johnston&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">wjohnston at mozilla.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i>In most situations, when the user puts a webpage in the background, any
</I>&gt;<i>media being played by the page should be paused. Any attempts to play
</I>&gt;<i>audio by a background page should also be prevented. However, for some
</I>&gt;<i>sites (music or radio apps) the user would like to continue to hear the
</I>&gt;<i>app while they do something else. These pages should be able to designate
</I>&gt;<i>their audio as a type that should keep playing while in the background.
</I>&gt;<i>The useragent should also attempt to avoid having the stream killed by
</I>&gt;<i>the operating system if possible. This is especially true on mobile
</I>&gt;<i>devices, but the problem is also already prevalent on desktop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think semantically we need a way to describe to the useragent how to
</I>&gt;<i>play a particular track. I'd suggest we add an optional attribute to
</I>&gt;<i>media elements, &quot;audiochannel&quot;, designating the output and priority of
</I>&gt;<i>this audio. The channel attribute can potentially take on three different
</I>&gt;<i>values. &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;background&quot;, and &quot;telephony&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;normal&quot; channels are the default for all media elements. Using them
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't require any special permissions. Audio playing with these
</I>&gt;<i>channels is paused when the web page moves into the background. In
</I>&gt;<i>addition, calling play on an media element with this channel while in the
</I>&gt;<i>background will put the element into the paused for user interaction
</I>&gt;<i>state (i.e. playback won't start until the webapp is brought to the
</I>&gt;<i>foreground)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;background&quot; channels will continue to play when the page is put into the
</I>&gt;<i>background. Trying to play a background channel while in the background
</I>&gt;<i>should also work. The ability to play audio on this channel may require
</I>&gt;<i>requesting permission from the UA first (i.e. possibly a prompt when the
</I>&gt;<i>audio is first played or when moving to the background). If the user
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't grant permission, these should throw a MediaError
</I>&gt;<i>(MEDIA_ERR_CHANNEL_PERMISSION_NOT_GRANTED?) so that the page can know
</I>&gt;<i>what has happened and do something appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;telephony&quot; channels are similar to &quot;background&quot; channels and can play
</I>&gt;<i>even if the page is in the background. Playing audio on a telephony
</I>&gt;<i>channel may cause any audio playing on &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;background&quot; channels
</I>&gt;<i>to be paused or have their volume severely decreased. They also, on
</I>&gt;<i>devices where its supported, will likely play over handset speakers
</I>&gt;<i>rather than normal speakers. Similar to &quot;background&quot;, these may require
</I>&gt;<i>permission from the UA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Note: This is all based rather loosely on the AudioChannels
</I>&gt;<i>implementation written for B2G recently [1]. It includes a few other
</I>&gt;<i>use-cases on its wiki page, along with definitions of additional channels
</I>&gt;<i>to accomadate them. I've been trying to simplify it down to handle the
</I>&gt;<i>most common use cases. Finding the correct terminology here is difficult
</I>&gt;<i>though. For instance, it seems likely that games will see the background
</I>&gt;<i>channel and think its an appropriate place to play game background music,
</I>&gt;<i>the exact type of audio you'd like to have paused when you leave the
</I>&gt;<i>game. Ideas for better ways to describe it are welcome.
