<PRE>Browsers can already implement this - Chrome did, in fact.  I don't think
it would be part of the spec.

Changing the default behavior of media elements today seems problematic;
all current &lt;audio&gt; elements, under this proposal, would start pausing when
you switched away from the tab.  Additionally, this isn't just media
elements - it needs to also affect Web Audio, as well as any plugins.  That
becomes a lot more problematic as well.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I support this proposal  makes total sense to me. We (Zynga) promise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we'll not misuse the priority channels :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In most situations, when the user puts a webpage in the background, any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; media being played by the page should be paused. Any attempts to play
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; audio by a background page should also be prevented. However, for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sites (music or radio apps) the user would like to continue to hear the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; app while they do something else. These pages should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> designate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their audio as a type that should keep playing while in the background.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The useragent should also attempt to avoid having the stream killed by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the operating system if possible. This is especially true on mobile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; devices, but the problem is also already prevalent on desktop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think semantically we need a way to describe to the useragent how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; play a particular track. I'd suggest we add an optional attribute to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; media elements, &quot;audiochannel&quot;, designating the output and priority of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this audio. The channel attribute can potentially take on three
</I>&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; values. &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;background&quot;, and &quot;telephony&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;normal&quot; channels are the default for all media elements. Using them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; doesn't require any special permissions. Audio playing with these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; channels is paused when the web page moves into the background. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; addition, calling play on an media element with this channel while in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; background will put the element into the paused for user interaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; state (i.e. playback won't start until the webapp is brought to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; foreground)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;background&quot; channels will continue to play when the page is put into
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; background. Trying to play a background channel while in the background
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; should also work. The ability to play audio on this channel may require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; requesting permission from the UA first (i.e. possibly a prompt when the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; audio is first played or when moving to the background). If the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; doesn't grant permission, these should throw a MediaError
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (MEDIA_ERR_CHANNEL_PERMISSION_NOT_GRANTED?) so that the page can know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; what has happened and do something appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;telephony&quot; channels are similar to &quot;background&quot; channels and can play
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; even if the page is in the background. Playing audio on a telephony
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; channel may cause any audio playing on &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;background&quot; channels
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to be paused or have their volume severely decreased. They also, on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; devices where its supported, will likely play over handset speakers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rather than normal speakers. Similar to &quot;background&quot;, these may require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; permission from the UA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Note: This is all based rather loosely on the AudioChannels
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; implementation written for B2G recently [1]. It includes a few other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use-cases on its wiki page, along with definitions of additional
</I>&gt;<i> channels
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to accomadate them. I've been trying to simplify it down to handle the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; most common use cases. Finding the correct terminology here is difficult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; though. For instance, it seems likely that games will see the background
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; channel and think its an appropriate place to play game background
</I>&gt;<i> music,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the exact type of audio you'd like to have paused when you leave the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; game. Ideas for better ways to describe it are welcome.
