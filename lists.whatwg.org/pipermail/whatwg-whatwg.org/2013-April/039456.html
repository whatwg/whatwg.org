I mean, let's say you delay the load event until after some data has 
loaded over a web socket. If you try to use that data from the load 
event handler it can fail in a racy way in UAs that don't support 
delaying the load event. This also seems like the kind of race that you 
are more likely to win on a local network, so it wouldn't necessarily be 
caught during development.

&gt;<i>     In general this seems quite a scary design. The load event is rather
</I>&gt;<i>     intimately tied in to the lifecycle of the document, and encouraging
</I>&gt;<i>     people to arbitrarily delay it feels like a potential source of bugs
</I>&gt;<i>     and confusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding new things that delay the load event has not been a source of
</I>&gt;<i> bugs and confusion in my experience. Authors do it a lot and we've done
</I>&gt;<i> it in specs too.
</I>
So far we have kept the model where the load event is auomatically 
managed by the UA, rather than giving the developer direct control of it.

&gt;<i>     Is getting screenshots of pages for thumbnails really something that
</I>&gt;<i>     needs an author-facing API? In general the concept of &quot;fully loaded&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     doesn't make any sense for a class of modern web applications, which
</I>&gt;<i>     might keep loading content or changing their presentation across
</I>&gt;<i>     their liefetime. Therefore it seems like simply taking one
</I>&gt;<i>     screenshot at page load and replacing it with one a little later
</I>&gt;<i>     after a timeout might be a good-enough solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is when you next load the application. You don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> replace a good screenshot with a screenshot of the application saying
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Loading...&quot;.
</I>
Then don't replace the screenshot with one taken at the load-event time 
if you already have one.
