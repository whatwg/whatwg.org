Putting a feature in the HTML spec (or related specs) is asking all
browsers to implement it.  If we don't expect anyone but Firefox to
implement something, then it shouldn't be in there.  If all you want is the
feature to have a specification, that's different--an API can have a
specification without it being inside the HTML spec, it can still be openly
reviewed here, etc.

(Not to argue one way or the other about whether it would be used or not--I
have only a mild intuition that it wouldn't be--only that the bar should be
cross-browser use.)

</I>
We've suggested firing a different event, leaving onload alone, so it's not
nearly so invasive.

</I>
We shouldn't expose one API with the expectation that we might have to add
a second API for the same thing.  Then we're permanently stuck with two
separate, overlapping APIs, which is far more complex.

Also, independent scripts loading on a page increase the probably of at
&gt;<i> least one failing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     document.delayLoadEvent();
</I>&gt;<i>     doX(function(){
</I>&gt;<i>         doY();
</I>&gt;<i>         document.stopDelayingLoadEvent();
</I>&gt;<i>     })
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
    var delay = document.delayCompletion();
    doX(function(){
        try {
            doY();
        } finally {
            delay.finished();
        }
    });



&gt;<i> That's a way to debug, not to react at runtime. If one of your independent
</I>&gt;<i> script forgets to call document.stopDelayingLoadEvent(), how does the page
</I>&gt;<i> recover to guarantee that the &quot;load&quot; event will happen eventually anyway?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm much more concerned with APIs being debuggable than APIs letting people
hack around bugs.  The delayCompletion() approach is the only one that is
trivially debuggable (you can figure out which DelayCompletion object was
never finalized, and where it was created); all of the others leave you
wondering which piece of code is messing about with the document attribute
or who called stopDelayingLoadEvent twice.

&gt;<i>   As a web developer, I can totally imagine a web browser forgetting to
</I>&gt;<i> fire &quot;load&quot; because of weird internal conditions like &quot;one
</I>&gt;<i> document.delayLoadEvent call was before DOMContentLoaded and another after&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My proposal isn't to touch onload at all, it's to fire some other
independent event.  Its only relationship to onload is that onload is when
onfinishedloading gets run, if no delayCompletion objects are pending at
that time.

   How are document.delayLoadEvent and document.stopDelayingLoadEvent any
&gt;<i> less global than an attribute on &lt;html&gt;? That is *exactly* the same amount
</I>&gt;<i> of globalness. The risks and consequences of bugs and malicious behavior is
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent for both features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Huh?  That wasn't my proposal; I argued specifically against that.  Please
see
<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2013Apr/0111.html,">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2013Apr/0111.html,</A>
and look at the sample implementation I gave you earlier:
<A HREF="https://zewt.org/~glenn/finished-loading.html.">https://zewt.org/~glenn/finished-loading.html.</A>


&gt;<i> &quot;I want it to be self-contained within the code that's actually using the
</I>&gt;<i> feature, not messing about with document-global attributes.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; The &quot;self-contained&quot; keyword makes me think that you really want Caja
</I>&gt;<i> or some lighter version of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good web APIs don't require the use of wrapper libraries (or script
postprocessing tools--sorry, that's gross) to use in a clean,
self-contained way.

(Sorry for some heavy snipping, but let's slow down discussing what the API
should look like for a bit, so we don't drown out the discussions about use
cases, the need for this feature, where it should live, etc.)
