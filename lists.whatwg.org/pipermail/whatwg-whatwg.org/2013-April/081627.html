In Gecko's case, say, it's cached based on URL and a sequence number (to 
handle POST).

</I>
As in &quot;store in the HTTP cache&quot;?  I suppose that could be done, in 
theory, but it would require rewriting how the HTTP cache interacts with 
the world...

&gt;&gt;<i> And yet in practice they are (not quite, but in the end similar).  So

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think those are the only options.
</I>
Sure, but the spec currently picks the second one of those two options, 
fwiw.

&gt;<i> Well, as Rob said, arguably the mentioned UIs don't really apply here
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, so maybe they should just not be shown.
</I>
Indeed.

My point was to raise a concern about this, in case it hadn't been 
considered, not to suggest a specific solution.  I don't have a specific 
solution to suggest.

&gt;<i> Note that nothing in the spec mentions these UI features at all
</I>
Sure.  At the same time, the existing UI feature set of UAs, and how 
feasible it is to support those features with new technologies we add, 
is worth considering when we spec new technologies.  Just as a thought.

I don't know that I have much more to contribute to this thread, honestly...
