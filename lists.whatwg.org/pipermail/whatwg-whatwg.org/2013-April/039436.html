Since browsers implemented a different fillRule API than what the spec 
had, I've updated the spec to better match implementations.

Because the browsers just went ahead and implemented this, I didn't end up 
responding to the feedback on this topic, since the reply to all that 
feedback is &quot;the spec now says what the browsers implemented&quot;. :-)

Comments below on orthogonal comments in those same e-mails:

</I>
Well you can certainly do that, sure, and we could provide an API that 
combines paths as a union rather than just adding the path segments 
(indeed at one point we had that in one of the earlier strawman 
proposals), but that's not one of the use cases that Path was originally 
designed for. The idea is that you'd just create separate regions for each 
of the paths, rather than combining them and having one region. The net 
result is the same.


&gt;<i> I think the spec needs to mention that
</I>&gt;<i> - sections of the path where both edges are filled should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> - winding needs to be done so eofill and fill give the same result
</I>
I've filed a bug for adding something like this:

   <A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=21835">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=21835</A>

I'm not sure exactly what the algorithm should be (as we discussed on IRC 
today), so if anyone has any input here, please don't hesitate to comment.

Since the browsers ended up implementing this as an enum, this will work:

  var ruleArgSupported = false;
  c.fill({ toString: function() { ruleArgSupported = true; return 'evenodd'; } });

I've added a fillRule argument to the HitRegionOptions dict.
