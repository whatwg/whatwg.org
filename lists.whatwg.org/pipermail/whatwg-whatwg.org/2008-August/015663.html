This seems to be exactly the same thing as what the spec says now, just 
with a different name.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ownerWindow is gone. There's no pipe-specific stuff that wouldn't also

</I>
I think it's much overly optimistic to think that we will never want to 
add port specific stuff to the port object, or worker specific stuff to 
the worker object. I just don't have that high confidence in that we can 
design these interfaces perfectly in the first version, nor phantom the 
features that people will want in future versions.

&gt;<i> I really don't like this idea of making Workers less generic. There's no

</I>&gt;<i> powerful while actually increasing implementation complexity.
</I>
Why is it making them less generic?

One need listed is the ability to in the future add properties that make 
sense on one interface but not the other. You are already listing 
onerror and onload as not really making sense on a generic MessagePort.

Why does it make things less powerful?

So far it seems like implementors are commenting on wanting this change, 
so implementation complexity doesn't seem like a real concern.

&gt;<i> Would it be better if instead of createWorker() we called the method 
</I>&gt;<i> connectToWorker(), and it creates it as well if the worker is unnamed or 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't yet exist? That would resolve the issue of what looks like a 
</I>&gt;<i> constructor not returning an object representing what it constructs?
</I>
That only addresses one of the comments listed in my last mail.
