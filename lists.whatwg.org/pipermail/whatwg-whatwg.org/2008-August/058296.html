I always use copy &amp; paste. So I really don't care a lot.

</I>
Make sure that when you do that analysis, you don't forget to check for 
prefixes of less-popular vocabularies, or prefixes used behind closed 
doors (intranets).

&gt;<i> HTML5 isn't really giving language users the choice. It gives the choice

</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> So the cost of using URIs should be weighed against the benefit of 
</I>&gt;<i> having such a generic bidirectional mapping that is open-ended in the 
</I>&gt;<i> sense that the mapping algorithm doesn't need new out-of-band input from 
</I>&gt;<i> a registry (other than the URI scheme and domain name registries 
</I>&gt;<i> apparently...) when someone mints a new vocabulary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> . . .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we didn't want the mapping to be bidirectional and only wanted it to 
</I>&gt;<i> be unidirectional from HTML identifiers onto URIs, we could specify that 
</I>&gt;<i> you can make a URI from any identifier you find in HTML by concatenating 
</I>&gt;<i> it to a common URI prefix. It doesn't really matter much if we call the 
</I>&gt;<i> prefix <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#,">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#,</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://n.whatwg.org/rdf-compat#">http://n.whatwg.org/rdf-compat#</A> or something else. (To avoid collisions 
</I>&gt;<i> between e.g. rel and class, you could put the attribute name in the URI: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://n.whatwg.org/rdf-compat/rel#keyword">http://n.whatwg.org/rdf-compat/rel#keyword</A> <A HREF="http://n.whatwg.org/rdf-compat/class#class-name.">http://n.whatwg.org/rdf-compat/class#class-name.</A>) 
</I>
That's a possibility, and furthermore exactly the way the Atom link 
relations registry works.

&gt;<i> . . .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But with a scheme that maps HTML syntax to *some* URIs, can the Power of 
</I>&gt;<i> RDF solve the rest? After all, the Power of RDF already assumes that 
</I>&gt;<i> clients have hard-coded knowledge of URI schemes (at least http) and can 
</I>&gt;<i> consult DNS dynamically. Moreover, the Power of RDF already assumes a 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically consulted mapping registry (like 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/ns#">http://creativecommons.org/ns#</A>) per each vocabulary. We could just say 
</I>&gt;<i> that HTML5 is one big vocabulary, so it can have one mapping registry.
</I>
I'm not so sure that what you call &quot;the Power of RDF&quot; actually 
*requires* namespace names to be resolvable.

&gt;<i> The HTML5 draft already specifies a registry for rel values:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions</A>
</I>
Which seems to be defunct, none of the entries has the state &quot;accepted&quot;. 
   I'm also very skeptic about

'For the &quot;Status&quot; section to be changed to &quot;Accepted&quot;, the proposed 
keyword must either have been through the Microformats process, and been 
approved by the Microformats community; or must be defined by a W3C 
specification in the Candidate Recommendation or Recommendation state.'

because that requires to either go through the W3C process or the MF 
community. I still believe that a simple IANA registry will work better.

&gt;<i> ...
