</I>&gt;<i> inside the document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

I think you were on to something with the CSS-like approach. Ian has 
stated earlier that class should be considered a generic categorisation 
element rather than only a CSS hook. If so then this would also let us 
hook metadata to classes. ie:

&lt;metadata type=&quot;text/cascading-metadata&quot;&gt;
.author {
    species: human;
    produces: books;
    consumes: coffee;
}
.author .john_smith {
    name: John Smith;
    dob: 2000-01-01;
}
&lt;/metadata&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
.author {
    color: purple;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Authors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;john_smith&quot;&gt;John Smith&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;jane_simmons&quot;&gt;Jane Simmons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


There is no reason why a range of XML metadata formats like text/rdf 
couldn't be supported provided they are not used inline (like the 
example above) but imported. ie:
&lt;link rel=&quot;metadata&quot; href=&quot;global.rdf&quot; type=&quot;text/rdf&quot;&gt;

Since this approach requires only one new tag &lt;metadata&gt; and the 
metadata is separate from the structural elements this should resolve 
some concerns. In addition since this proposal does not limit HTML to 
one metadata language (though a default could be decided) so there is 
more flexibility in the future to support currently unknown formats.

 From the designers point of view there is less typing, since a single 
class attribute can hook both style and meaning to the same structure 
and the meanings can be reused. Using a public namespace would be a 
simple matter of:
&lt;link rel=&quot;metadata&quot; 
href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.standards.org/metadata/media/movies.rdf&quot;">http://www.standards.org/metadata/media/movies.rdf&quot;</A> type=&quot;text/rdf&quot;&gt;

If RDF or RDFa are considered too heavy to be a default language (and 
they suffer from being impossible to embed inline or in &lt;metadata&gt; 
blocks) then the &quot;cascading metadata&quot; approach above might be useful. 
Since it can reuse existing CSS parsers, editors and behaviour 
(selectors, cascading model) it should have a lower implementation 
burden than XML+Namespaces.
