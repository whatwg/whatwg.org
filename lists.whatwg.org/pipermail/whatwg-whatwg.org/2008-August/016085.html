Isn't that nitpicking a bit? It's part of the feature-set that a browser
would have to implement, part of the books that have to be written,
etc..., right?

&gt;<i> I don't really think it makes sense to compare that
</I>&gt;<i> feature to RDF though... (Because as far as I can tell we're not talking
</I>&gt;<i> about adding an RDF triple store to browsers.)
</I>
Exactly, RDFa makes far fewer demands.

&gt;&gt;<i> The cost is small when we've already written a lot of the documentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and specs for how this would work (in XHTML, but it's all DOM-based.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it makes the language more complex. That's a significant cost.
</I>
So, since we've written the documentation, and we're willing to write it
in the context of HTML5, what is the *significant* cost to the HTML5 WG?

&gt;&gt;<i> Ubiquity is a plug-in. The user-agents themselves don't have to support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those features directly, at least not now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not now&quot; was my point, indeed.
</I>
Just to be clear, I meant &quot;not now&quot; for user-agents' mandated UIs, but
certainly &quot;now&quot; for integrating into the language and letting user-agent
extensions handle them.

&gt;&gt;<i> The SQL-in-the-browser spec affects user-agents quite a bit more, since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they actually *have* to provide SQL capabilities, otherwise they're not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conformant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, though again, that's a totally different feature. Supporting
</I>&gt;<i> (dynamic) CSS layout probably costs us a lot more, yet having that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't imply we should simply add support for everything that is less
</I>&gt;<i> complex.
</I>
I'm only trying to frame the complexity of RDFa to that of another new
feature that was recently added. I wouldn't dream of comparing to CSS,
which is obviously not new.
