</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be mostly useful for people creating small websites that

</I>&gt;<i> Ruby. That being the case, if something like this is implemented the
</I>&gt;<i> included content should definitely not be accessed like with an
</I>&gt;<i> iframe. The elements included should be in the DOM tree of the parent
</I>&gt;<i> just as if the includes were done server side. Accessing the DOM of an
</I>&gt;<i> iframe from the parent and vice versa causes people a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion. I don't think we need to add that level of confusion to the
</I>&gt;<i> group of users that would most likely use this feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, a bonus of keeping &lt;include src=&quot;some-content.html&quot; /&gt; in the
</I>&gt;<i> DOM, is that changing the source could reload the content of that
</I>&gt;<i> element. You would have instant AJAX/XHR for dummies.

This is basically what i've suggested in a thread some months back. 
Basically an &lt;iframe&gt; but that renders as if the inner was included inline.

This is far from easy to implement since you have to do layout across 
several documents. But I think it would be a pretty useful feature to 
simplify AJAXy pages.

If I ever get time I'm going to attempt an implementation in firefox 
which will hopefully provide experience to build a spec on.
