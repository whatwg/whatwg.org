When you control the software used to read the data, it doesn't matter 
what the data format is.


&gt;<i> Aside from embedded links, which can point into the file system and are

Exactly.


&gt;<i> HTML has some nice characteristics like resolution independence, direct

</I>
It has charactersitics that are independent of its use on the Web, yes.


&gt;<i> For many use cases, especially cross-platform ones, HTML is the 
</I>&gt;<i> formatted text format of choice.
</I>
HTML isn't a formatted text format...


&gt;<i> A properly designed HTML spec should not require, prohibit, or 
</I>&gt;<i> preference a document being read from the network or from a local file 
</I>&gt;<i> system or via any other protocol. HTML 1 through 4 and XHTML 1 and 2 had 
</I>&gt;<i> this important characteristic. I hope HTML 5 does as well.
</I>
I imagine it will. But it's not a requirement. If something comes up that 
would make HTML better for the Web and as a side-effect makes it not work 
for non-Web cases, then we should do it, not because of the side-effect, 
but because it makes HTML better for the Web. That HTML5 works for non-Web 
cases can be a happy accident, but it's not an intentional characteristic.
