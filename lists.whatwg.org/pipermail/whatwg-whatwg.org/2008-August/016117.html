Let's make sure not to discuss everything at once.

The first point is that embedded metadata with RDFa has clear use cases
and does not lead to any more logical issues than normal human-readble
web pages. I don't know if you agree with that yet, but we think we've
made some solid points to support this argument.

The second point is: what should the names of the actual attributes be?
Well, we can argue about that till the cows come home. No matter what
you choose, a lot of people will be unhappy because they &quot;read&quot; the HTML
in different ways. We think we've picked attribute names that are rather
harmless and that are &quot;close enough&quot; to what we mean. And we had an open
discussion about it for 2 years. At some point, you have to declare that
an issue like this one is &quot;good enough.&quot;

Let's try keep those two points of discussions separate.
