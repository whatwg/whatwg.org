I think that'll cause problems as well -- for example, let's say you  
had two overlapping paths that you wanted to draw a shadow behind.   
The two paths are both solid and are supposed to be rendered as a  
single shape to the user.  If you drew them separately with shadows,  
as it stands now, the shadows would end up adding and would be denser  
in the overlap areas which isn't what the author would intend.  I  
would suggest:

- special case opacity 0, 0,0 offset, 0 blur radius as 'shadows off',  
as Oliver suggested to preserve current usage

- if shadows aren't off, draw them normally -- one shadow per drawing  
operation

- go the whole way and add beginLayer/endLayer, akin to  
CGContextBeginTransparencyLayer[WithRect]/EndTransparencyLayer.  Could  
also call it pushGroup/popGroup.  As a side benefit, this would  
provide a simple way to implement double-buffered rendering without  
needing to use two canvases.  (<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGContext/Reference/reference.html#/">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CGContext/Reference/reference.html#/</A>
