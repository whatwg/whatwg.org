Yeah, I don't feel strongly either way here. It feels &quot;cleaner&quot; to not 
have separate SharedWorker instances for each user of a shared worker, 
but there are also downsides with not doing that (like onerror and other 
future properties that we might want).

So I'm fine either way.

</I>&gt;<i> since there's no target without the port in that case.
</I>
Ah, of course.

&gt;&gt;<i> If we keep the constructors (see first paragraph), I would prefer the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> syntax &quot;new Worker&quot; over &quot;new DedicatedWorker&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's fine, I can change the base to be AbstractWorker and then have 
</I>&gt;<i> Worker and SharedWorker as the interfaces inheriting from it.
</I>
Sounds good to me.
