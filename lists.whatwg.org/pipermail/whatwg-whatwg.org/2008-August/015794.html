This still ends up being expensive due to the round-trip cost of checking 
if the resource has changed or not, even if the resource itself isn't 
transferred. It's cheaper to just include the content. If we wanted to 
optimise this case, we should look into dictionary-based compression.


&gt;<i> HOWEVER - how about just using the xlink design and making it part of

I assume you mean XInclude, not XLink (XLink is a disaster). Certainly if 
people want to use XInclude with XHTML there's nothing in the HTML5 spec 
that stops it.
