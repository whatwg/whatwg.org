Kristof - you will have to be more precise. Could you please outline (in
short form bulleted list), every specific issue that you have with RDFa.
 A parallel short-form bulleted list of all RDFa features that you enjoy
would also be welcome. I believe that this thread has been going long
enough for you to formulate an educated opinion about what you do like
and what you don't like about RDFa. Getting such a list together will
also help us address your grievances better.

Here's an example of what I'd like to see:

RDFa Pros:
- Allows semantic metadata markup in HTML family languages.
- Does not use QNames

RDFa Cons:
- Mixes semantics with HTML structure
- Uses CURIEs to specify prefixes
- Does not work like CSS and does not re-use @class

and so on...

If any of you that have been involved in all of these discussions can
weight in with a list like that it would be very helpful. I can put
together a set of issues that the HTML5 community is concerned about and
we can start discussing them in the W3C RDFa Task Force.
