I think that example could be solved simpler actually. An &lt;audio&gt; 
element can be moved between two documents without requiring any 
interference in its functionality. So if pandora used an &lt;audio&gt; to play 
music they could easily transfer the playing to another window.

Ideally this would also work with plugins, However for various reasons 
this is very hard without modifying NPAPI.
