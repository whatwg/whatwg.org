</I>
It's not different from hiding content that isn't necessary. That's 
exactly what it is. It's a way to hide content that isn't currently 
relevant.

Right. This attribute says &quot;this shouldn't be here at all for now&quot;. 
Whereas in CSS, you're just saying &quot;optionally, remove this&quot;. CSS is 
fundamentally an optional layer, but sometimes the content really 
shouldn't be visible regardless of the style layer.

Screen readers should be aural browsers and just use media=speech, but 
that's another story.


&gt;<i> I would like something to indicate that text should not be rendered by 
</I>&gt;<i> the UA but still remain accessible. Content that should be available to 
</I>&gt;<i> screen readers but not have a visual representation is, in fact, 
</I>&gt;<i> relevant. It's relevant in that it gives additional information to 
</I>&gt;<i> non-sighted users that is probably visually indicated to those who can 
</I>&gt;<i> see.
</I>
That's a CSS issue.


&gt;<i> If accessibility is the point of the &quot;irrelevant&quot; attribute, then it 
</I>&gt;<i> fails.
</I>
It isn't. (Well, accessibility is a key aspect of the attribute, but it 
isn't specifically for accessibility any more than, say, &lt;p&gt; is.)

</I>&gt;<i> If the true purpose of the irrelevant attribute is to aid in

</I>&gt;<i> include content in a page that is irrelevant? What you really need is a 
</I>&gt;<i> way to say &quot;this is relevant only for non-visual UA's&quot;. Perhaps a better 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute name would be &quot;nonvisual&quot;?
</I>
The &quot;true&quot; purpose is to separate the structure and semantics from the 
presentation. &quot;Accessibility&quot; (and &quot;Internationalisation&quot; and &quot;Security&quot; 
and &quot;Performance&quot;) isn't a purpose, it's just a design technique.

</I>
HTML5 already provides a way to hide content from specific media, the 
&quot;media&quot; attribute on &lt;style&gt; and &lt;link rel=stylesheet&gt;.

</I>
Given the definition of &quot;rendered&quot; in the spec, that's redundant.

I've renamed it &quot;hidden&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Though, I wonder if these two cases are addressed by sections/

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. See-through-view modality
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to &quot;pop a dialog&quot; on top of (while still showing) the

</I>
That would be a fine way to render content marked with this attribute, 
sure.


&gt;<i> 2. Unload modality
</I>&gt;<i> Most modality discussed so far has been about the view modality, ie
</I>&gt;<i> disallowing the user from accessing the original page content until
</I>&gt;<i> the dialog has been dismissed. Browser modality may also be about
</I>&gt;<i> not letting the browser unload/reload the page until a dialog has 
</I>&gt;<i> been dismissed (eg &quot;do you want to save before closing the window?&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way to force a user to respond to a modal dialog
</I>&gt;<i> section before unloading the page?
</I>
No. Use onunload=&quot;&quot; and prompt() for this, if you must.


&gt;<i> If not, ideally a generic modality feature could be added to assist both 
</I>&gt;<i> sections and current style HTML dialogs in achieving this unload 
</I>&gt;<i> modality.
</I>
Interesting. This might be something to consider in future, once we have 
more experience with this attribute.
