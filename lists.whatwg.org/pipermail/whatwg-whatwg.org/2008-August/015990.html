Chris,

All examples written up by Manu are completely unambiguous, because we
only parse @rel, @rev, and @property as CURIES, never as URIs (and if
your value doesn't encode a valid, prefixed CURIE, we ignore it.)

(Reading the CURIE spec on its own is not really the right target,
especially since that is still being worked on, whereas the RDFa spec
stands on its own and clearly explains how CURIEs are used *in RDFa*.)

The only time we need disambiguation is for @about and @resource, which,
 since they specify objects, we wanted to have accept URIs as a default,
just like @href. The disambiguation step of Safe CURIEs only applies for
those, and only when you want a CURIE in there, which is rare.

So, the processing rules are actually trivial and quite robust.

And all of Manu's examples function without any disambiguation.

-Ben
