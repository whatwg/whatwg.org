Added a section for this case.

I've added text to clarify this case.

Added a section.


&gt;<i> And as a more general point, the spec provides a list of cases for using

I'd like to try making it comprehensive first. Am I missing any other

Those images aren't representing images, so they seem invalid to me. If we 
want to support this case it seems like there have got to be better ways 
to do it.


&gt;<i> [slicing]

</I>&gt;<i> For instance it would be reasonable to use two images -- a filled star and an

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You'd want the text version to be:

</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;p&gt;Rating: &lt;img src=1 alt=3/5&gt;&lt;img src=1 alt&gt;&lt;img src=1 alt&gt;&lt;img
</I>&gt;<i>    src=0 alt&gt;&lt;img src=0 alt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
Added an example like this to the spec.

I've used &lt;meter&gt; in the example, to hint at this.

This seems over-engineered for such a simple problem.

The spec doesn't allow them to claim compliance without being accessible 
here.

</I>
Well, similarly there's no way for the validator to know if the alt=&quot;&quot; 
attribute is allowed to be empty, or is allowed to say &quot;Goat&quot;, or 
whatever. There's a limit to what validators can do.

</I>&gt;<i> Both represent a total lack of information with no explicit relationship

</I>&gt;<i> information, not empty ones. An altgroup supports this - empty alt tags 
</I>&gt;<i> do not.
</I>
There are a lot of images that need to say alt=&quot;&quot; (with the empty value) 
to get optimal accessibility, e.g. decorative images, images redundant 
with surrounding text, etc. Even in HTML4, alt=&quot;&quot; with the empty value is 
allowed in certain cases.

</I>
Right now, in cases where it's impossible to know what appropriate alt 
text is, the author (or editor) should use alt=&quot;{image}&quot; or some such.
