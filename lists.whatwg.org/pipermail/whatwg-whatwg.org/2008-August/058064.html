This seems to be mostly useful for people creating small websites that
are afraid of server side scripting languages like PHP, Python and
Ruby. That being the case, if something like this is implemented the
included content should definitely not be accessed like with an
iframe. The elements included should be in the DOM tree of the parent
just as if the includes were done server side. Accessing the DOM of an
iframe from the parent and vice versa causes people a lot of
confusion. I don't think we need to add that level of confusion to the
group of users that would most likely use this feature.

Also, a bonus of keeping &lt;include src=&quot;some-content.html&quot; /&gt; in the
DOM, is that changing the source could reload the content of that
element. You would have instant AJAX/XHR for dummies.
