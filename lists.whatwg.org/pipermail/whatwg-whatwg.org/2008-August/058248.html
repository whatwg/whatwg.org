<PRE>
I've updated the Workers specification in response to feedback. The 
proposal I sent recently contains a summary of the changes I made:

That's basically what the spec does now.

I generally agree with this, and indeed it didn't take to convince me to 
use a utils object in the first place. If Jonas and Aaron agree, I'd be 
happy to go back to a utils object. It's a trivial change to the spec.


&gt;<i> That all said, I think calling it a &quot;utils&quot; object does seem messy in 
</I>&gt;<i> it's genericness. Maybe just call it the &quot;worker&quot; object, in the same 
</I>&gt;<i> way that there is a &quot;window&quot; object?
</I>
That would be confusing because there is a 'worker' object, it's the 
global scope. (Whatever we do, _some_ of the API surface will end up on 
the global scope, and that's the 'worker'.)

The key things that it provides are:

 * Ability to do long computations without breaking it up into blocks.

 * Ability to do synchronous I/O without blocking the UI.

 * Ability to use multiple cores on modern CPUs.

Scripts run using setTimeout() all run in series, on one thread, so they 
can't do any of the above.

Given the single-threaded model of JavaScript today, I don't see how you 
could emulate the Workers API today.


&gt;<i> Another issue with eliminating threads is that they are very desirable

</I>&gt;<i> browser vendors may go ahead and implement them anyway, essentially 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;embracing and extending&quot; HTML5 and ECMAScript.
</I>
It's browser vendors who have asked for the no-sharing model, so this 
seems unlikely. If browser vendors wanted a shared-data model with 
mutexes, etc, I would likely oblige, but so far they seem to agree that 
exposing Web authors to such constructs is a bad idea.

</I>
Co-routines don't provide the three things described above. They only use 
one core, they don't intrinsically yield on I/O unless you do some pretty 
fancy changes to the libraries, and they definitely don't handle doing 
long computations without chopping the calculation into blocks, since the 
whole point of coroutines is chopping things up. :-)

They just run one after the other. There's no concurrency.

If you need to obtain a lock on some global state that is used across 
multiple workers, then have an object that receives messages and simply 
queues up the requests, sending the value (and ownership) to each script 
in turn, never sending the value to a new script until the previous one 
has closed or relinquished the lock.


So for example instead of this:

&gt;<i> --- worker.js ---
</I>&gt;<i> updateGlobalLa = function (e) {
</I>&gt;<i>   var localLa = someLongRunningFunction( e );
</I>&gt;<i>   workerGlobalScope.port.postMessage(&quot;set la = &quot;+ localLa);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> workerGlobalScope.port.AddEventListener(&quot;onmessage&quot;, updateGlobalLa, false);
</I>&gt;<i> workerGlobalScope.port.postMessage(&quot;get la&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --- main.js ---
</I>&gt;<i> // global object or variable
</I>&gt;<i> var la = 0;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> handleMessage = function(e) {
</I>&gt;<i>   if (typeof e.match(&quot;set la&quot;))
</I>&gt;<i>      la = parseInt(e.substr(3));
</I>&gt;<i>   } else if (typeof e.match(&quot;get la&quot;)) {
</I>&gt;<i>      worker.postMessage(la.toString());
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> var worker = new Worker(&quot;worker.js&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> worker.AddEventListener(&quot;onmessage&quot;, handleMessage, false);
</I>
You would have:

  // worker.js
  var laPort;
  addEventListener('message', function (e) {
    if (e.message == 'la') {
      // received a handle to the la manager
      laPort = e.port;
    }
  }, false);
  function useLa() {
    laPort.postMessage('get');
    laPort.onmessage = function (e) {
      var localLa = parseInt(e.message);
      someLongRunningFunction(localLa);
      laPort.postMessage(localLa);
    };
  }
  ...
  onmessage = function (e) {
    if (e.message == 'use la')
      useLa();
  };

  // main.js -- implementation of la
  var la = 0;
  var laQueue = [];
  var current;
  function registerLa(port) {
    port.onmessage = function (e) {
      if (e.message == 'get') {
        if (current) {
          // someone has the lock, so queue this up
          laQueue.push(port);
        } else {
          // nobody has the lock, send the data
          port.postMessage(la);
        }
      } else {
        if (port == current) {
          // release the lock
          la = e.message;
          current = null;
          // if the queue is not empty, post to the next one
          if (laQueue.length &gt; 0) {
            current = laQueue.shift();
            current.postMessage(la);
          }
        }
      }
    };
  }

  // main.js -- worker creation code
  var worker = new Worker('worker.js');
  registerLa(worker.startConveration('la'));
  ...
  worker.postMessage('use la');


However, I have yet to come across a time where you would need a global 
locked object across multiple threads in this way in a Web app, so I don't 
think it's a big deal.


&gt;<i> I don't think I can stress enough how many important properties and 
</I>&gt;<i> functions of a web page are ONLY available as globals. DOM nodes, style 
</I>&gt;<i> properties, event handlers, window.status ... the list goes on.
</I>
Why would a worker ever deal with any of those? The whole point of workers 
is to do non-UI-related work.


&gt;<i> Without direct access to these the only useful thing a worker can do is 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;computation&quot; or more precisely string parsing and maths.
</I>
And network I/O and database I/O, yes.


&gt;<i> I've never seen a video encoder, physics engine, artificial intelligence 
</I>&gt;<i> or gene modeller written in javascript and I don't really think I ever 
</I>&gt;<i> will.
</I>
I've seen a video encoder and a physics engine in JS, and I expect to see 
more, especially with Workers. However, those aren't the target. Things 
like synchronising databases in the background are more the kind of thing 
we are imagining here.

What's the use case? It seems that it would be easy for the author to keep

That's an implementation detail, I don't think we should comment on it.

Since it's not possible to do so right now, I don't think any exist.

Those don't work in the browser without the user having to download binary

Yeah, we'll add that in due course.

No, locks are just a hard-to-use programming model. They are frequently 
the source of bugs for experienced programmers, putting them into the 
hands of Web authors seems highly ill advised.

This is the same as the script time execution limit on unload today.

The close() method kills a worker dead without cleanup. The idea is that 
this would be used for cases like when you are doing a search across a 
wide amount of data. You could fire off ten workers, each searching within 
one tenth of the data, and then as soon as any of them reply with a hit, 
you kill all of them.


&gt;<i> Is it possible for a worker (shared or dedicated) to reload itself?
</I>
Not currently.


&gt;<i> How do workers and appCaches interact?
</I>
workers are associated with browsing contexts, so they go through the 
normal app cache networking changes. This probably interacts badly with 
shared workers used from different app caches. We should probably study 
this more.

Aaron, Maciej, others, do you have opinions on how these should interact?

I've stuck with having a SharedWorker instance; it seems safer on the long

I've made postMessage() return void throughout. This means that now if you 
want to know that there is a problem, you should register for onclose on 
your port or worker, and assume that anything you sent recently failed.
