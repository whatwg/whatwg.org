<PRE>A background task invoked by setTimeout has to be split to small chunks;
_yielding_ occurs when each chunk ends (having called setTimeout to execute
the next chunk).  It is very hard to code in this way; you have to maintain
an explicit stack and create an exit/entry point at every chunk boundary.
This technique is interesting as an academic exercise only, real-world
developers will be right to stay away from it.
It is not enough to _serialize_ access to global variables; you also have to
serialize access to anything accessible from them.  Example: 
{ var la = g.i; g.i = la + 1 }.  Run it twice in parallel and you will see
g.i incremented by 1 or 2, depending on the interleaving.  Is that what you
want?

Actually I was referring to the browser forcefully interleaving the 
callback execution so they appear to run simultaneously. I was under the 
impression this is how they behave now. I don't see how Javascript 
callbacks can be cooperative since they have no yield statement or 
equivalent.

He wasn't against WebWorkers, he was, as you say,  against full 
threading (with all the mutexes and locks etc... exposed to the JS 
author). I can't find the reference site but it doesn't really matter 
except from the point of view that many people (including myself) aren't 
convinced a full pthread -like API is the way to go either. I just don't 
see why locking can't be transparently handled by the interpreter given 
that the language only interacts with true memory registers indirectly.
