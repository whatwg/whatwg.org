<PRE>Has anyone put any further thought on what to do about captions for Ogg?

We've started to throw some thoughts together here:
<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/Captioning_Work_Plan">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/Captioning_Work_Plan</A>

We could use some help from individuals who understand the area of video 
and captions. The problem of deciding what to do for captions in &lt;video&gt; 
or specifically for Ogg does not appear to be simple. I'd appreciate it 
if someone could prove us wrong.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have a shared understanding of how to do this concretely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This should all be out of scope, IMHO;  this is about the design of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a captioning system, which I don't think we should try to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the captioning format should be specified by the video format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> family. However, in this case it has become apparent that there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently isn't One True Way of doing captioning in the Ogg family.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In principle, this is a problem that the specifiers of the Ogg family
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should solve. In practice, though, this thread arises directly from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an issue hit by the Mozilla implementation effort. Since the WHATWG
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is about interoperable implementations, it becomes a WHATWG problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make sure that browsers that implement Ogg for&lt;video&gt;  and content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> providers have the same understanding of what the One True Way of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing captioning in Ogg is if the HTML 5 spec tosses the captioning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem to the video format (which, I agree, is the right place to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> toss it to). Hopefully, the HTML 5 spec text can be a one-sentence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> informative reference to a spec by another group. But which spec?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ogg indeed currently has no preferred means of specifying captions.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually it happens through a separate srt or ssa or similar file and
</I>&gt;<i> the player makes sure to display the captions correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just had a look at the W3C DFXP format
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/</A>). It looks rather
</I>&gt;<i> similar to CMML, lacks the hyperlinking functionality, but has
</I>&gt;<i> stylesheet and formatting support in it and more
</I>&gt;<i> subtitle/karaoke-specific functionality. I believe it would be
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward to define a media mapping for DFXP into Ogg should we
</I>&gt;<i> decide that DFXP is the way forward. Similarly, it would be rather
</I>&gt;<i> simple to define a media mapping for any of the anime subtitle formats
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhat orthogonal to the discussion about subtitles is the use of
</I>&gt;<i> CMML. Yes, it is possible to use CMML in its current specification as
</I>&gt;<i> a superset of a srt-type sutitle format. However, the &quot;description&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> element would then need be interpreted as the caption, which is
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat of a misuse. I actually see captions and CMML as orthogonal
</I>&gt;<i> concepts - CMML provides hyperlinks and machine-readable textual
</I>&gt;<i> annotations in a timed manner, while captions provide formatted text
</I>&gt;<i> for users to read.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is exactly what CMML provides to Ogg: timed textual annotations,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering whether it might be a good idea to include some of the
</I>&gt;<i> DFXP specifications into CMML to enable it better for captiosn and
</I>&gt;<i> thus not have to deal with multiple timed text formats. I haven't
