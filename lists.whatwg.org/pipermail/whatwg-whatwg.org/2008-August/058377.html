<PRE>&quot;Does not use QNames&quot; is not an advantage any more than &quot;does not require
the user to be a USA citizen&quot;.  So you could have listed that as well.
I would like to append the following to the disadvantages:
The interface A[property] is very misleading.  You read it as &quot;The property
of this anchor is cc:creator&quot;.  That does not make any sense (an anchor has
several properties and cc:creator is not one of them) and it does not
reflect what you want to say, which is &quot;this anchor represents a property
named cc:creator of its enclosing element&quot;.  I am not sure how to fix this;
&quot;isProperty&quot; would be better but still not very good.

Kristof - you will have to be more precise. Could you please outline (in
short form bulleted list), every specific issue that you have with RDFa.
 A parallel short-form bulleted list of all RDFa features that you enjoy
would also be welcome. I believe that this thread has been going long
enough for you to formulate an educated opinion about what you do like
and what you don't like about RDFa. Getting such a list together will
also help us address your grievances better.

Here's an example of what I'd like to see:

RDFa Pros:
- Allows semantic metadata markup in HTML family languages.
- Does not use QNames

RDFa Cons:
- Mixes semantics with HTML structure
- Uses CURIEs to specify prefixes
- Does not work like CSS and does not re-use @class

and so on...

If any of you that have been involved in all of these discussions can
weight in with a list like that it would be very helpful. I can put
together a set of issues that the HTML5 community is concerned about and
we can start discussing them in the W3C RDFa Task Force.
