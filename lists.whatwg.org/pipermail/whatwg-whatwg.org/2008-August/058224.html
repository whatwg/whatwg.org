Right, it came from a group of folk who clearly described their problem 
(you can't browser GMail offline, you can't use Google Reader offline, 
every time you query the user's data in the server-side database, you have 
to do a network round-trip) and their requirements (e.g. has to work for 
Web apps, has to work for a variety of application types, has to work 
offline, has to be able to support full-text search, has to be able to 
support structured data, has to be synchronisable).

I have no idea what problem RDFa is trying to solve. I have no idea what 
the requirements are.

If you want this seriously considered for HTML5, please write a clear and 
concise e-mail that explains what the needs are.


&gt;<i> So my question is: what would it take to convince you that we need 
</I>&gt;<i> something more generic than the one-off solutions you and others have 
</I>&gt;<i> been suggesting?
</I>
I have no idea what problem you're trying to solve, so it's hard for me to 
answer this question.


&gt;<i> &gt; We have to address problems that people know they have, or would agree 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they have if told they had them, because people won't spend any effort 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to address problems they don't think they have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, just to be clear, how does that link up with SQL-in-browser? When 
</I>&gt;<i> you say &quot;people,&quot; do you mean web publishers / application builders?
</I>
Users. One of the problems, for instance, was that they could not access 
their GMail while offline.


&gt;<i> &gt; The word &quot;problem&quot; doesn't appear once in the ccREL paper. Where is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the statement of what ccREL is trying to solve?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the exact word doesn't have to appear, does it? Here are the first 
</I>&gt;<i> two sentences of the introduction:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This paper introduces the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language 
</I>&gt;<i> (ccREL), the standard recommended by Creative Commons (CC) for 
</I>&gt;<i> machine-readable expression of copyright licensing terms and related 
</I>&gt;<i> information. ccREL and its description in this paper supersede all 
</I>&gt;<i> previous Creative Commons recommendations for expressing licensing 
</I>&gt;<i> metadata.&quot;
</I>
That's not a problem statement, sorry. It's a description of what it does, 
but it doesn't say why anyone needs that.


&gt;<i> From this it's pretty clear that we're trying to express copyright 
</I>&gt;<i> licensing information (with all of the sub-fields it implies and all the 
</I>&gt;<i> possible data types we might license) in machine-readable form.
</I>
I know _what_ you're trying to do, it's _why_ you're trying to do it that 
matters.


&gt;<i> A one-page answer? That's only possible if you're willing to accept 
</I>&gt;<i> premises like &quot;RDF is a good way to express interoperable data on the 
</I>&gt;<i> web.&quot;
</I>
The one-page answer should be explaining why you need to express 
interoperable data on the Web in the first place. It shouldn't even 
mention RDF. RDF is part of a proposed solution, it's not part of the 
problem.


&gt;<i> Imagine trying to convince someone about SQL-in-browser when that 
</I>&gt;<i> someone doesn't believe that SQL is the right approach, rather that it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be XML object and XPath. Can you do that in one page?
</I>
The point isn't to convince me about the solution. The point is to 
convince me that there is a problem at all, so that we can consider what 
solutions might exist.


&gt;<i> But without a baseline, you're sending me on a fool's errand.
</I>
I'm trying my best to explain to you how you can get somewhere here. This 
is a good faith effort at trying to help. If you think my advice is 
somehow intended to waste your time then I can't help you.
