I think the motivation was that if you remove a DOM subtree which happens to
contain &lt;video&gt; or &lt;audio&gt; elements, they should pause. Otherwise, if you
want to &quot;safely&quot; remove a DOM subtree you would have to always iterate
through it to stop all media elements, otherwise you're leaking because
elements (especially looping ones) can play indefinitely even if there are
no outstanding references to them. A paused media element can be freed if
there are no outstanding references to it, since there is no way for it to
ever start playing again.

Also, should it also work if you just pass a reference to the node
&gt;<i> into the other window?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, because its ownerdocument would be the old document and when that
document is not active, the element will not play.
