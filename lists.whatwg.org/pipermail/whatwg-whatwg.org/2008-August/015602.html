I think Garret has a valid point (despite his needlessly rude tone)  
that the way we describe magical dynamic properties in a way that  
makes clear they are also visible to the &quot;in&quot; operator and to  
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty. Are there any DOM bindings that have  
index (or named) properties which are *not* visible in such a way? If  
not, then the current [IndexGetter] definition is useless and we need  
a better formalism.

&gt;<i> I think that Web IDL can&#8217;t provide as much syntactic help for HTML
</I>&gt;<i> collections where the properties are real.  So HTML will probably have
</I>&gt;<i> to include a sentence such as:
</I>
I also don't understand what is meant to by calling some properties  
&quot;real&quot;. I don't think this is a meaningful distinction. The core of  
the point that Garret raised (as far as I can tell) is that the  
properties are visible to has/in checks as well as gettable, and I  
think this is true in all cases of DOM objects with dynamic index/ 
named properties.

&gt;<i>  In the ECMAScript language binding, for every node in the collection
</I>&gt;<i>  there must exist a property on the collection object whose name is
</I>&gt;<i>  the index of the node in the collection, and whose value is the node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With some wording about whether these extra properties take precedence
</I>&gt;<i> over other properties on the object due to the interface, etc.  Ian?
</I>
I think Web IDL should provide a formalism to cater to this, because  
nearly all bindings with special dynamic properties work like this  
afaik. But I think it would have to involve a pseudo-method for the  
&quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; check (which &quot;in&quot; is based on).
