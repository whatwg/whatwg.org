</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Security. Availability is reduced even further by ISP and organisations 
</I>&gt;<i> that flat-out refuse to support SSI due to security and support 
</I>&gt;<i> concerns.
</I>
All three of the above basically boil down to the same thing -- there are 
hosting providers that don't provide the simplest of features. That's 
certainly true, but there are also hosting providers that provide these 
features for very cheap (e.g. $120/year or less) that provide all this and 
more, so I don't buy this argument. If you're having trouble finding one, 
contact me privately and I can give you a coupon code for one.


&gt;<i> Reuse. SSI follows no agreed set of rules and therefore may require code 
</I>&gt;<i> changes when changing hosting provider. Some systems provide extensions 
</I>&gt;<i> that authors may assume is part of a standard, but aren't. We have an 
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to define a simpler and more reliable interface that is 
</I>&gt;<i> independant of any server configuration.
</I>
If it's just a static site, then you can just pre-generate the pages and 
upload the completed pages, so there's no dependency on the server. This, 
incidentally, also works when the server-side hosting provider doesn't 
support SSIs at all.

If it's not a static site, then the SSIs are going to be the least of your 
problems when you change to a different server.


&gt;<i> Speed. Concerns about speed are generally only valid for the first page 
</I>&gt;<i> on the first visit to a site. Subsequent pages can be much faster than 
</I>&gt;<i> SSI and even static html since common banners and footers can be cached 
</I>&gt;<i> seperately - requiring only a unique content download. This is less 
</I>&gt;<i> trivial than it sounds since global drop-down menus, ad frames, tracking 
</I>&gt;<i> code, overlays and embedded JS and CSS often account for a vast majority 
</I>&gt;<i> of the source code.
</I>
We're talking about such a small amount of data here that the latency far 
outweighs the bandwidth cost on most connections. Given that you still 
have to do an If-Modified-Since check, you don't really gain anything 
here. If we did want to optimise for small parts of the content being 
common over multiple pages, we should investigate dictionary-based 
compression with site-specific dictionaries. That would get us much, much 
better performance than cached CSIs.


&gt;<i> Flexibility. It's hard to tell because the seamless proposal is vague 
</I>&gt;<i> but from what I can tell there are a lot of things a &quot;seamless&quot; iframe 
</I>&gt;<i> is not seamless about. For instance can absolutely positioned items be 
</I>&gt;<i> positioned relative to the enclosing document? Do child and adjacent 
</I>&gt;<i> selectors work across the iframe boundary? Will IE give up its behaviour 
</I>&gt;<i> of placing iframes above the document regardless of z-index? Includes 
</I>&gt;<i> don't have any of these issues because they are treated as part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> document, not as a special case.
</I>
This isn't an argument over SSIs. I agree that for inclusions, the &lt;iframe 
seamless&gt; feature isn't optimal. It was not designed for that, it was 
meant for including sandboxed blog comments and the like.


&gt;<i> &gt; A TCP round-trip is very expensive. A client-side parsing-level 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include would mean that the parser would have to stop while a complete 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; round-trip is performed. There's really no way to get around that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; short of making it a higher-level construct like &lt;iframe seamless&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is actually an easy solution for this, though it is less flexible 
</I>&gt;<i> than my original proposal. The solution is to require each include to be 
</I>&gt;<i> balanced (equal number of open and close tags) so the surrounding block 
</I>&gt;<i> is guaranteed to be a single node. Anything left open is forcefully 
</I>&gt;<i> closed (as when reaching &lt;/body&gt; with open blocks). In other words:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot; style=&quot;min-height:500px&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;include src=&quot;content.ihtml&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- always closes content --&gt;
</I>
What do you do when the CSIed page includes script that manipulates 
content after the include? Now you have a race condition. This is just as 
bad as blocking, if not worse, since it's now unpredictable.


Anyway in conclusion I don't understand what CSIs give us that is actually 
worth the massive amounts of effort they require. Just generate your pages 
server-side or upload them to your server pre-generated.
