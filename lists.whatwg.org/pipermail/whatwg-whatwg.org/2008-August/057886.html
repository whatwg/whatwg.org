I think that the unnamed columns make it difficult to use, because you
have to remember which column does what. I've used a similar
text-based format, the Firefox chrome.manifest format, and I found it
difficult for the same reason.

If we ever needed to have columns that were optional for a given
section, it would become difficult to see if they were specified
because of the lack of names.

If rows ever get long with more than a few columns, there is no
ability to wrap them with the given format. This would come for free
with many other formats.

If we ever needed to add any kind of hierarchy, we would have to
reinvent something like XML, JSON, or YAML.

To me, the idea of inventing a custom one-off format for this is ugly.
I realize this is somewhat a matter of taste (unix uses lots of
line-based format and hey, it works fine for them), so I will drop
this and just leave it as a vote for XML.

Ok, I don't think this feature needs to be in this spec then, IMO.
HTTP caching essentially does the same thing, anyway. If it is in the
spec, I think it should be separated from the fallback feature.
