I don't think that argument follows quite the way you frame it. Even if
the recommendation is to use long-lasting registries, you can still
choose the registry you want, build your own, etc... Meanwhile, the
centrally registered prefixes are, well, *centrally* controlled, which
is a very different architectural choice, and, where data is concerned,
not as web-like as one really wants.

That said, I don't think this is a bad idea at all.

In defining RDFa, we said that various host languages (HTML5, XHTML1.1,
XHTML2, ...) may choose to include some built-in additional definitions,
e.g. new reserved keywords in @rel.

I am certainly open to considering a mechanism for pre-defined prefixes
in HTML5+RDFa, as long as they are machine-discoverable by
follow-your-nose (likely via the HTML5 spec doc), and as long as those
prefixes can be overridden in a given document and new prefixes can be
defined at will.

And I appreciate this suggestion, which definitely moves the discussion
forward!
