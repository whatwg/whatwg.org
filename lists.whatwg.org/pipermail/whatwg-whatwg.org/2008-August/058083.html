<PRE>I still get the feeling that this is an element that is being invented for the purpose of being invented and doesn&#8217;t solve any existing problem, or resolve any difficult to implement problems that are not already solved in layers below and above HTML.

I worry slightly from this and similar proposals that certain parts of the spec will end up being deprecated in the next spec due to lack of use.

With regards to instant AJAX for dummies, I struggle to accept that no-one is able to download an already existing javascript library that provides this functionality in a few simple lines.

Maybe I've missed something but is there a mandate which sets out the audience HTML5 is trying to satisfy?

Do we really need to reinvent the wheel?

</I>&gt;<i> included content should definitely not be accessed like with an
</I>&gt;<i> iframe. The elements included should be in the DOM tree of the parent
</I>&gt;<i> just as if the includes were done server side. Accessing the DOM of an
</I>&gt;<i> iframe from the parent and vice versa causes people a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion. I don't think we need to add that level of confusion to the
</I>&gt;<i> group of users that would most likely use this feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, a bonus of keeping &lt;include src=&quot;some-content.html&quot; /&gt; in the
</I>&gt;<i> DOM, is that changing the source could reload the content of that
</I>&gt;<i> element. You would have instant AJAX/XHR for dummies.
</I>
This is basically what i've suggested in a thread some months back. 
Basically an &lt;iframe&gt; but that renders as if the inner was included inline.

This is far from easy to implement since you have to do layout across 
several documents. But I think it would be a pretty useful feature to 
simplify AJAXy pages.

If I ever get time I'm going to attempt an implementation in firefox 
which will hopefully provide experience to build a spec on.
