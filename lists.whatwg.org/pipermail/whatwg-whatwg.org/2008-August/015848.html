My point is that all these use cases are out of scope for the WHATWG, 
which is specifically and exclusively concerned with Web technologies.

There are many use cases for which one could warp HTML -- e.g. it could be 
(and has been) used to author books, it could be (and has been) used to 
author letters, it could be (and has been) used to author help 
documentation. However, HTML5's scope does not include developing 
technologies to compete with DocBook, ODF, or the info format. If we end 
up developing a technology that happens to work for those cases that's 
fine, but it is not our goal, and such use cases are not going to be 
considered in the development of HTML5.

Thus, if those are amongst your use cases, I recommend taking such 
concerns to more appropriate mailing lists.

Cheers,
