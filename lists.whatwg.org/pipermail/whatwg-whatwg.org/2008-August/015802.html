drawImage is already overloaded, so why not carry on with that, unless we
change the API as you suggest below.

One other thing that I would consider would be requiring the frame# to be
&gt;<i> specified explicitly as that would make things like &quot;chapter&quot; previews (or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever) work in a way that is perhaps cleaner.  Otherwise you have to

</I>&gt;<i> whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
AFAIK we'd basically have to implement that by creating a second video
stream, seeking it and then capturing the frame, and you really don't want
to do that synchronously! Then we'd want to cache that stream so that
another drawFrame with a nearby frame index was efficient ... ick. So I
suggest not offering that API. Authors can always use a second, hidden video
element to achieve the same effect.
