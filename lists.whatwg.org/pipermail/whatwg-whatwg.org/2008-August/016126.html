I do.

They solve the problem they are supposed to solve. I've been taking 
advantage of them in many many projects over the last few years, and it 
really all works as expected.

I admit that there are some aspects that suck; the main one being the 
primitive support in DOM, and the fact that it took years until 
serializers did work as expected (without the programmer having to 
explicitly deal with xmlns attributes).

Of course it's totally cool nowadays to diss XML namespaces -- it would 
be interesting to see what other design and syntax would have worked 
better, and which decisions about the syntax may be wrong in 
retrospective. But then it's also cool to prefer JSON or tag soup over XML.

But that would be a discussion for xml-dev.

BR, Julian
