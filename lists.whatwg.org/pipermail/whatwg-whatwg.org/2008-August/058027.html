<PRE>I do not know about implementing setTimeout, this should be rather
straightforward.  However, using setTimeout to do anything serious requires
chunking and yielding as described below, which is an academic exercise
IMHO.  I expect that WebWorkers would give a better abstraction than
setTimeout (like throw vs longjmp).
My example about {++g.i} was about how automatic locking of global variables
is not enough, not about the advantages of using workers.  I would expect
the worker to send &quot;increment g.i&quot; to the main thread, not &quot;set g.i to
$value&quot;.  If &quot;increment&quot; is replaced with something infeasible, we have a
problem.  However, I would not be sure incrementing is unlikely to fail;
were it so, WIN32::InterlockedIncrement would be pointless.

I'm not sure I get your meaning. If this is how current browsers 
implement setTimeout then how is it &quot;academic&quot;? Also since nobody is 
talking about deprecating setTimeout I don't see how its relevant. 
Whatever happens setTimeout remains an issue that real-world developers 
can't stay away from.
