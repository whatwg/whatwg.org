What advantage does this have over server-side includes?

The &lt;iframe doc=&quot;&quot; seamless&gt; idea has the advantage of not blocking 
rendering, which a client-side parsing-level include would. I don't really 
see what the advantage of a client-side parsing-level include would be.

Yeah, I've been considering making the &lt;title&gt; element optional for 
documents that aren't meant to be navigated to directly, like includes.


&gt;<i> HTTP 1.1 pipelining should remove any performance concerns that includes 
</I>&gt;<i> would have over traditional SSI since the retrieval process only 
</I>&gt;<i> requires the sending of a few more bytes of request and response 
</I>&gt;<i> headers.
</I>
A TCP round-trip is very expensive. A client-side parsing-level include 
would mean that the parser would have to stop while a complete round-trip 
is performed. There's really no way to get around that short of making it 
a higher-level construct like &lt;iframe seamless&gt;.
