<PRE>I was going to suggest the spec define unsigned integers as a value
between 1 and MAX_INT inclusive when I realised the spec doesn't define
the range of integer values at all. Is this deliberate?

Either way I would recommend making a decision on minimum and maximum
integer values an using them consistently. If not I can imagine the
rapid adoption of 64-bit systems will cause unexpected errors when the
same code is run on older 32-bit systems. There are valid arguments for
letting each system use its native integer but if this is the case then
perhaps the spec should require MIN_INT and MAX_INT be made available as
constants.

Also the spec interchanges the terms &quot;non-negative integer&quot;, &quot;positive
integer&quot; and &quot;unsigned integer&quot;. I suggest defining one of these clearly
and then using it everywhere.

This is a very minor point but is it necessary to say &quot;valid integer&quot;.
Given that there appears to be no defined min/max range when is
something both an integer and at the same time invalid? Isn't an invalid
integer a string?

Finally I wasn't aware Javascript made a distinction between signed and
unsigned integers. Is the distinction really necessary? Can we just make
everything signed integers and consistently call the full range
&quot;integer&quot; and the positive range &quot;integer greater than 0&quot;?
