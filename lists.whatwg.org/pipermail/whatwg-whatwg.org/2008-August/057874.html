We've implemented the current format already in WebKit (available in  
nightlies and the Safari 4 Developer Preview).

The format does not seem to have much call for extension and seems  
easy to understand and use as-is.

I think the idea of opportunistic caching (as I understand it) is that  
the author can be lazy, and not write a manifest at all.

</I>&gt;<i> - Maybe this is obvious, but it's not specified what happens when the

I agree the online whitelist should allow patterns of some form.

&gt;<i> - I know you added the behavior of failing loads when a URL is not in

</I>&gt;<i> they expect to be offline. But maybe we should just remove the whole
</I>&gt;<i> thing about failing loads of resources not in the manifest and online
</I>&gt;<i> whitelist for v1.
</I>
I think it would be hard to add later after the fact.

Maciej
