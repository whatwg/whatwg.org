&gt;<i> I encounter sites frequently that want to &quot;pop out&quot; part of their
</I>&gt;<i> application free of the page, into a smaller window. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> Pandora radio (<A HREF="http://pandora.com">http://pandora.com</A>) does this. The player starts out
</I>&gt;<i> embedded in the normal content area, but users have the option to pop
</I>&gt;<i> it out into a smaller, separate window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One problem with these apps is that they have to shutdown and restart
</I>&gt;<i> in the popup window. So if I'm playing a song in Pandora, it loses
</I>&gt;<i> tracks of where I am and restarts in the pop out player.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like shared workers could help with this problem. If some
</I>&gt;<i> future version of workers had access to the Audio API, the base
</I>&gt;<i> pandora.com page would start a shared worker, which would be used to
</I>&gt;<i> play the audio. If the user opted to open the &quot;player&quot; in a popup, the
</I>&gt;<i> popup would simply obtain a reference to the existing worker. The
</I>&gt;<i> music wouldn't have to restart. If the user navigated away from
</I>&gt;<i> pandora.com, the popup would keep the worker alive until it was
</I>&gt;<i> closed.
</I>&gt;<i>

Why not just open new window and move the playing &lt;audio&gt; element from the
old window into the new window? You might need to call play() on it again in
the new window, but you shouldn't lose your place in the stream.

the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are
healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
