Wouldn't it be better to return three possible values: &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and
&quot;don't know&quot;?

Any browser that supports integration with an extensible framework like
GStreamer, Quicktime or Direct Show is going to have a hard time ever
reporting &quot;false&quot;. Apparently there was a conversation today in #theora that
you might have seen whcih explains why this is so, at least for GStreamer.

With a three-value return, at least Firefox with both Ogg Theora and
Quicktime support could return &quot;yes&quot; for Ogg and &quot;maybe&quot; for other types.
But I think Safari is going to have to return &quot;maybe&quot; all the time ---
except perhaps for codecs built into Quicktime. That doesn't help you.

It still seems to me that the best approach would be to try to play the
stream using &lt;video&gt;, catch the error if that fails and then instantiate
fallback. This is really what the media frameworks want you to do; the
browser is just the meat in the sandwich.
