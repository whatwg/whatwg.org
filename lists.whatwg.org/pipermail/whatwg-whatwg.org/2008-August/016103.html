<PRE>Please.  We both agree that a job position has a title.  This title
attribute, when applied to a job position, is just fine; you can apply it to
a book here and to a job position there and you see from the context what
kind of a title it is.  But you cannot apply a title of a job position to a
person; you need job-title for the purpose because otherwise you have no way
to attach &quot;count&quot;, &quot;marquis&quot; and the like.  If you want your properties to
mean something unrelated to their ordinary vocabulary meaning, or only
indirectly related, choose ones that are not present in a vocabulary, such
as GUIDs, or you will confuse everybody.

&quot;&quot;&quot;
That's fine and you have defined &quot;title&quot; for your own use... but what
about my use! I want to use &quot;title&quot; as a means to identify the title of
a job position in my resume vocabulary. There is no need to use
&quot;job-title&quot; as it is redundant in my vocabulary.

Your definition of title &quot;A book has exactly one title&quot; has nothing to
do with my definition of &quot;title&quot; &quot;The title of the position that was
held for a period of time.&quot; Title most certainly is not a shortcut
property in my vocabulary.
