What's the answer to my question then? Should I have been able to derive it
somehow?

&gt;<i> For greater seamlessness, I'd prefer to make the intrinsic height be the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would that be more seamless? Surely that would be less seamless if
</I>&gt;<i> there were things like negative margins, since then you'd have unsightly
</I>&gt;<i> scrollbars appearing.
</I>

You mean the scrollbars associated with the iframe viewport?

Well, viewport scrollbars are already a bit magical. The CSS initial value
of 'overflow' is 'visible', yet all browsers use 'auto' for viewport
scrollbars unless another value is propagated up from the root element or
HTML &lt;body&gt;. So I'd suggest that for seamless iframes, the viewport overflow
be 'visible' unless another value propagates up.

I just realized that using the height of the root element won't make much
sense if the root element is positioned. I'm not sure how much to care about
that.

&gt;<i> Plus, as dbaron suggested, we'd like 'overflow' to apply to the content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of seamless iframes so that horizontal and vertical overflowing content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be rendered as if the iframe was a regular overflow:visible block.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (We might want to recommend that the UA style sheet contain &quot;iframe {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overflow:hidden; }&quot; to make it easier for authors to avoid spoofing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attacks via seamless sandboxed iframes using clever positioning.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I guess I'm ok with that, but that will presumably require
</I>&gt;<i> significantly changes to the CSS spec to define how it all works (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> with compositing and so forth).
</I>

We can make the iframe a stacking context. Then I don't see any problems
with compositing.


&gt;<i> The current definition is intended to be
</I>&gt;<i> really easy to implement without needing any changes to the CSS model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that's a good goal, but we also want it to be reasonably &quot;seamless&quot;.

I'm concerned about the use case of very wide content in the iframe (i.e.
content overflowing the root element horizontally); for example a forum with
many wide messages, each of which is a seamless iframe. Right now it seems
the choices are to either have a horizontal scrollbar in each message or
clip each message horizontally, there's no way to make it work like a forum
page.

Actually I'm not 100% sure you mean by &quot;the width that the element would
have if it was a non-replaced block-level element with 'width: auto'&quot;. You
mean if it was such a block-level element containing the root element of the
iframe's document?
