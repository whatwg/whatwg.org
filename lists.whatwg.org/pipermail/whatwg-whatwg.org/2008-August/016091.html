There are several things that have bad consequences with regard to your
solution to the namespace problem.

Take this scenario, for example - an author disagrees with your
vocabulary because it conflicts directly with their vocabulary:

&quot;&quot;&quot;
That's fine and you have defined &quot;title&quot; for your own use... but what
about my use! I want to use &quot;title&quot; as a means to identify the title of
a job position in my resume vocabulary. There is no need to use
&quot;job-title&quot; as it is redundant in my vocabulary.

Your definition of title &quot;A book has exactly one title&quot; has nothing to
do with my definition of &quot;title&quot; &quot;The title of the position that was
held for a period of time.&quot; Title most certainly is not a shortcut
property in my vocabulary.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

If you didn't have namespacing of some kind, such as &quot;title&quot;, this sort
of problem - as found in the Microformats community, becomes more and
more prevalent as more vocabularies are created (like the example given
above).

If you choose namespaces that contain arbitrary separators, such as
&quot;resume.title&quot; you still have the issue of potential conflicts and
you're inventing a new namespacing mechanism for the web - which is bad
design.

If you use URIs, such as &quot;<A HREF="http://purl.org/resume/title&quot;">http://purl.org/resume/title&quot;</A> you are using a
familiar concept to all users of the Web, re-using a design that the Web
uses for uniquely identifying resources and removing all potential
conflicts regarding vocabulary term collision.
