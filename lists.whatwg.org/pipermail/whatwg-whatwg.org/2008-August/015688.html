</I>&gt;<i> However this means that you have to deep inside your threads algorithm

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus 1. Threading is easier to implement using workers since you don't

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, web workers allow the browser to spin up real OS threads and put

</I>&gt;<i> is becoming very common today, the work the page is doing can take 
</I>&gt;<i> advantage of more cores, thus producing better throughput.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also unsure which mozilla developer has come out against the idea

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;traditional&quot; threading APIs that include locks, mutexes, 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronization, shared memory etc. But that's not what the current 
</I>&gt;<i> spec has. It is a much much simpler &quot;shared nothing&quot; API which already 
</I>&gt;<i> has a basic implementation in recent nightlies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> / Jonas
</I>&gt;<i>

I assumed setTimeout used real threads but I'm not advocating its use 
anyway. I think Lua co-routines solve every issue you raise. I hope 
WebWorkers will follow this model because I know from experience they 
are very easy to use. The basic features are:

* each coroutine gets a real OS thread (if available).
* coroutines can access global variables; Lua handles the locking itself.
* yield and resume are available, but optional.
* coroutines are garbage-collected when complete.
* coroutines run a function, not a file. There is no need for a separate 
file download.

the syntax is:

function workerThreadFunction()
   ... do stuff ...
end

workerThread1 = coroutine.create( workerThreadFunction )

A Javascript implementation could also assist the programmer by 
automatically skipping threads that are waiting on IO or blocked waiting 
on user input since these actions usually represent a large faction of a 
web page workload.

Maybe I misunderstand the concept of &quot;shared nothing&quot; but I think 
denying access to global objects is unwise. Maybe in a low-level 
language like C that's a bad thing but high-level languages can 
serialise simultaneous access to variables to prevent crashes and 
deadlocks. Performance can be improved by explicitly declaring private 
thread variables using var.

If coroutines are adopted I hope they will be called &quot;coroutines&quot;. 
WebWorkers sounds silly and doesn't really assist in understanding their 
purpose (you have to already know what they are to understand the analogy).

I think this proposal belongs in an ECMAScript discussion group but I 
only bring it up here due to my extreme dislike of the current 
WebWorkers proposal. I think the best way forward is to drop WebWorkers 
completely from HTML5 and let the ECMAScript group look at it for JS 2.0 
or 3.0.
