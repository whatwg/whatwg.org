FWIW I think we have a problem in that multiple independent people have seen 
data-* and assumed they are for externally readable metadata. If the bad effects 
of people using it for that purpose are worse than the usefulness of the 
feature, we need to consider removing the feature. If the bad effects are not so 
bad we need to consider legitimizing this as it is clearly something that it is 
clear will happen irrespective of what the spec says.
