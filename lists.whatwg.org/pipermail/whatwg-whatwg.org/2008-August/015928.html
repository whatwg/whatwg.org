I do not agree that this is a problem.

We would be foolish not to, because URIs are already the established 
naming system on the web. Introducing another one requires mapping 
between both, which will be expensive and fragile.

Examples:

- RDF predicates
- WebDAV properties, condition codes, report names
- XML namespace names
- XSLT extensions
- XML Schema datatypes (yes, also used in Relax NG)
- XHTML modularization
- JCR node names, property types and node types

There are a few examples of naming systems that I use in my daily work. 
I'm sure if you ask other people, they'll quickly come up with other 
examples.

&gt;<i> One good way to see whether it really is a problem is to look at the Java 
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystem. Have clashes been a big problem there?
</I>
Classes that were put into the &quot;default&quot; package certainly were a 
problem -- when those need to be re-used, they usually have to be 
renamed (into a package). That may be no problem for a few Java classes, 
  but more of a problem with names that are widely used outside some 
Java code.

Not using URIs and inventing a new naming scheme instead means working 
*against* existing naming schemes. So I think it's up to you to prove 
that it's worth the cost.

BR, Julian
