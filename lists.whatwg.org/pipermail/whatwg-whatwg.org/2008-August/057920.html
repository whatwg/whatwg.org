I don't feel very strongly about this right now. It's something we 
started debating at mozilla and I think we'll debate it a bit more 
before coming to a conclusion. I'm fine with putting it in the global 
scope for now. Sorry, i didn't mean to ask for an immediate action on 
this yet.

</I>
Though in the vast majority of cases only the first step is needed. A 
second step is only needed in the very complex use cases of:

* Having sibling workers talk directly to each other.
* Having a worker talk directly to a frame from a different origin.
* Having a worker shared across different instances of the app.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would that work for you?
</I>
I thought about that, but what happens if you pass such an object to 
postMessage? Throws an exception? Only the parts of the API that is a 
MessagePort dies?

One solution I thought about is to have a base interface such as:

interface MessagePort {
   void postMessage(...);
   attribute EventListener onmessage;
   ...
}

Then have

interface Worker : MessagePort {
    bool isShared();
    &lt;worker specific stuff&gt;
}

interface PipePort : MessagePort {
    attribute Window ownerWindow;
    &lt;Pipe specific stuff&gt;
}


And then make the APIs that we want to allow passing around pipe-ends 
take a PipePort object.

The result is basically that workers are separate objects from what's 
returned for (new MessagePipe()).port1, but they share some API.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Should import() accept an array of URLs, so that the UA can fetch

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We could do that if you like. Is it needed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the connection limits being upped in all the browsers, I think this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be a good thing to have from the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. Should they be run in whatever order they load in or should 
</I>&gt;<i> they be run in the order given on the aguments?
</I>
Yes. Another thing is that this function should probably return void and 
always throw if something goes wrong. I doubt that having the server 
return a 404 is expected enough that just returning 'false' will keep 
the program executing fine.
