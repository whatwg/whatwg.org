</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. You have a fluid layout where the columns are resizable via
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> javascript by dragging the borders. The content of one of the columns is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an iframe. You begin dragging the border between it and the column to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the left, but as soon as the cursor goes over the iframe, the dragging
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> functionality stops because you have now entered the context of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> iframe. Thus it becomes impossible or at the very least very difficult
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to resize the column containing it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seems like a bug. It seems like we would want to address this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly rather than requiring authors to disable iframes when doing drags
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (especially since that wouldn't help with things like plugins or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever). Wouldn't the better solution be to provide some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism to say that while the mouse button is down, all the mouse move
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> events should go to the element that got the mousedown event?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would probably work, though I don't know if limiting it to the
</I>&gt;<i> specific element itself might cause any issues. For instance,
</I>&gt;<i> something lacking in the HTML5 drag and drop specification is the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to define a handle for the element that is being dragged. 
</I>I assume by 'handle' you mean a grabber element which is used to drag a 
larger element, much like a titlebar drags a window.
If so, you would just make the 'handle' draggable=&quot;true&quot;. That you are 
dragging the other element is just conceptual for the user. The 
setDragImage for instance could be set to the other element to make a 
drag feedback image

&gt;<i> Perhaps there is a mousemove event in the current context (the parent
</I>&gt;<i> document let's say) that is checking to see if the user tries to drag
</I>&gt;<i> an object over it. We don't want to break the ability to create this
</I>&gt;<i> sort of collision detection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be safer to say that while the mouse button is down, all the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse move events should be processed in the same &quot;context&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> mousedown event occurred in. So if the mousedown occurs in the parent,
</I>&gt;<i> mouse move events should be processed in the parent until a mouseup
</I>&gt;<i> occurs. Likewise, if a mousedown occurs in the child iframe, mouse
</I>&gt;<i> move events should be processed in the child iframe until a mouseup
</I>&gt;<i> occurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Is this related to the html5 drag and drop spec? It isn't clear from 
your earlier comment and this one. In the spec, mouse events don't fire 
at all during a drag. Implementations would fire dragover events in the 
parent or child frames as needed.

Dragging columns widths probably wouldn't be done using the html5 d&amp;d, 
but instead would need a mouse capturing api as previously described.
