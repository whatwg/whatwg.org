I'm not sure what you meant by that. Regular iframes always clip their
contained documents, setting &quot;iframe { overflow:visible; }&quot; won't do
anything. Well, it won't in Gecko; I haven't tested it in other browsers,
but I'd be surprised if they were different.

Note that the default width and height are adjusted for seamless iframes
&gt;<i> to match the width that the element would have if it was a non-replaced
</I>&gt;<i> block-level element with 'width: auto', and the height of the bounding box
</I>&gt;<i> around the content rendered in the iframe at its current width,
</I>&gt;<i> respectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;The bounding box&quot; is a bit ambiguous. If the content overflows vertically
above the iframe's viewport, does that contribute to the height of the
bounding box?

For greater seamlessness, I'd prefer to make the intrinsic height be the
height of the iframe's root element. Plus, as dbaron suggested, we'd like
'overflow' to apply to the content of seamless iframes so that horizontal
and vertical overflowing content can be rendered as if the iframe was a
regular overflow:visible block. (We might want to recommend that the UA
style sheet contain &quot;iframe { overflow:hidden; }&quot; to make it easier for
authors to avoid spoofing attacks via seamless sandboxed iframes using
clever positioning.)
