<PRE>Publishers who publish commercial content on physical media are rarely
interested in having their content repackaged by someone else as they see
fit.  This is not very pleasant of course; however, you could possibly try
to solve your problem by asking the vendor for a license to repackage their
content.

Subject: Re: [whatwg] Client-side includes proposal

I've used a number of CDs which contained encyclopedias, dictionaries,
medical and legal references.
If those were shipped as html content w/ clever json indexes, then i
could add my own application later to read it. If it's some binary,
then I'm forced to trust the binary and have no access to the data.

That said. I don't know that there's anything in this specific request
that should actually be needed beyond the inline iframe feature....
