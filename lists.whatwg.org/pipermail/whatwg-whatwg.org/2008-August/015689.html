</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Web workers provide two things over the above:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. It makes it easier for the developer to implement heavy complex 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithms while not hanging the browser.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. It allows web pages to take advantage of multicore CPUs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What you describe above is also known as cooperative multithreading. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I.e. each &quot;thread&quot; has to manually stop itself regularly and give 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control to the other threads, and eventually they must do the same and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give control back.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However this means that you have to deep inside your threads algorithm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> return out to the main event loop. This can be complicated if you have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a deep callstack with a lot of local variables holding a lot of state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus 1. Threading is easier to implement using workers since you don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to escape back out to the main event loop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, web workers allow the browser to spin up real OS threads and put 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off the worker execution there. So if you have a multicore CPU, which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is becoming very common today, the work the page is doing can take 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantage of more cores, thus producing better throughput.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also unsure which mozilla developer has come out against the idea 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of web workers. I do know that we absolutely don't want the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;traditional&quot; threading APIs that include locks, mutexes, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synchronization, shared memory etc. But that's not what the current 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec has. It is a much much simpler &quot;shared nothing&quot; API which already 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has a basic implementation in recent nightlies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> / Jonas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I assumed setTimeout used real threads but I'm not advocating its use 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. I think Lua co-routines solve every issue you raise. I hope 
</I>&gt;<i> WebWorkers will follow this model because I know from experience they 
</I>&gt;<i> are very easy to use. The basic features are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * each coroutine gets a real OS thread (if available).
</I>&gt;<i> * coroutines can access global variables; Lua handles the locking itself.
</I>&gt;<i> * yield and resume are available, but optional.
</I>&gt;<i> * coroutines are garbage-collected when complete.
</I>&gt;<i> * coroutines run a function, not a file. There is no need for a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> file download.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the syntax is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> function workerThreadFunction()
</I>&gt;<i>   ... do stuff ...
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> workerThread1 = coroutine.create( workerThreadFunction )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A Javascript implementation could also assist the programmer by 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically skipping threads that are waiting on IO or blocked waiting 
</I>&gt;<i> on user input since these actions usually represent a large faction of a 
</I>&gt;<i> web page workload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I misunderstand the concept of &quot;shared nothing&quot; but I think 
</I>&gt;<i> denying access to global objects is unwise. Maybe in a low-level 
</I>&gt;<i> language like C that's a bad thing but high-level languages can 
</I>&gt;<i> serialise simultaneous access to variables to prevent crashes and 
</I>&gt;<i> deadlocks. Performance can be improved by explicitly declaring private 
</I>&gt;<i> thread variables using var.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If coroutines are adopted I hope they will be called &quot;coroutines&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> WebWorkers sounds silly and doesn't really assist in understanding their 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose (you have to already know what they are to understand the analogy).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this proposal belongs in an ECMAScript discussion group but I 
</I>&gt;<i> only bring it up here due to my extreme dislike of the current 
</I>&gt;<i> WebWorkers proposal. I think the best way forward is to drop WebWorkers 
</I>&gt;<i> completely from HTML5 and let the ECMAScript group look at it for JS 2.0 
</I>&gt;<i> or 3.0.
</I>
One problem with what you're proposing is that in a browser environment 
the C host language and the javascript language is heavily intertwined. 
What do you do if a co-routine that lives in a separate thread calls 
into the DOM, which in most (all?) browser implementations isn't 
threadsafe? And what if that DOM call results in callbacks into 
javascript again?
