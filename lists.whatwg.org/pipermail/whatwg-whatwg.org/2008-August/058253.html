<PRE>You cannot support both CURIEs and URLs.  What happens when someone declares
xmlns:http?

&gt;&gt;<i> prefix short-hand via CURIEs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is definitely not better.

I don't know where you're coming from since you haven't elaborated on
that statement nor given a link to a document explaining your thought
process. Since you haven't done so, all I can do is shoot in the dark as
to what your issue with CURIEs might be...

Let me first start with why we have this URL short-hand (aka: CURIEs) in
the first place. It is a feature that helps web authors and others that
are writing this stuff by hand to refer to long URLs in an easy way.
This means that the following:

&lt;div about=&quot;#thunder&quot; typeof=&quot;<A HREF="http://purl.org/media/video#Movie">http://purl.org/media/video#Movie</A>&quot;&gt;
   &lt;b property=&quot;<A HREF="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</A>&quot;&gt;Tropic Thunder&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

can be written like so, when using CURIEs:

&lt;div about=&quot;#thunder&quot; typeof=&quot;video:Movie&quot;&gt;
   &lt;b property=&quot;dcterms:title&quot;&gt;Tropic Thunder&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

all one must do to enable CURIEs, is to define the prefixes at any DOM
element that is higher in the tree, like so:

&lt;div xmlns:video=&quot;<A HREF="http://purl.org/media/video#">http://purl.org/media/video#</A>&quot;
     xmlns:dcterms=&quot;<A HREF="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</A>&quot;
     ...

I can already hear the screams of protest on this list, as I understand
this to be the one of the most evil things that you can do in the WHATWG
group. :)

We have been discussing an alternate way of expressing prefixes, like so:

&lt;div prefix=&quot;video=<A HREF="http://purl.org/media/video#">http://purl.org/media/video#</A>&quot;

The @prefix attribute above would take a space-separated list of
prefixes as CDATA, which could address one of the issues that the HTML5
community has with the CURIE proposal. However, I believe that we are
far from discussing this at the present time - the WHATWG would have to
acknowledge that web semantics is a problem they are interested in
addressing with HTML5.

Perhaps you could outline the reasons that the HTML5 community is so
allergic to the concept of URL-short-hand using prefix mapping in HTML
documents? I ask out of curiosity and because I have never heard the
whole story from the WHATWG's perspective.
