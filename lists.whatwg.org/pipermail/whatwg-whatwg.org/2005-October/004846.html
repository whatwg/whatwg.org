Hello!

I was reading the thread and ... I was also thinking that the initial  
suggestion of allowing the use of the TYPE attribute would not really  
solve (all) the problems.

The suggestion with which James came up is really good, but the FOR  
attribute should allow more than one IDs. Here's why: a quiz can have a  
question which allows multiple answers. Yet, there are a few things open  
to discussion if this would be done: such as displaying the answers (we  
all know designers probably want various 'cool' ways to delimit each  
answer et cetera).

If it will be decided to allow things such as &lt;ref&gt;s then I'd say: do it  
all the way.
