<PRE>&gt;<i> If the browser had an HTTP daemon built-in, 
</I>&gt;<i> would that work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, since you can't guarentee that incoming connections will connect (e.g.
</I>
&gt;<i> because you are behind NAT with no port forwarding, a very common case).
</I>If the client initiated the connection, then the roles were reversed, that
would mirror the TCPConnection approach.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, requiring that UAs implement HTTP servers, as opposed 
</I>&gt;<i> to just implementing the simple TCPConnection protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> described at the moment, seems like a significantly more 
</I>&gt;<i> expensive way of solving this problem.
</I>A full (i.e. complex) server wouldn't be necessary, just the protocol
parsing.
Implementing the protocol for simple use is straightforward, and bringing in
Apache as a library would be one approach.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Another example would be something like an IM or chat client. All 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the current implementations of that are huge hacks that would be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; much simpler to implement if they could just open a TCP connection 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and send free-form data back and forth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've implemented IM and chat applications with just HTTP, HTML and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Javascript. In a browser. Without plugins.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, lots of people have. It would be a lot simpler with a 
</I>&gt;<i> bidirectional asynchronous text-based messaging protocol, though.
</I>&gt;<i>From my perspective, it would be a lot simpler to re-use a working protocol
</I>(HTTP) rather than start over &amp; re-learn all the mistakes of the past.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The DOM Event portion of the specification is very similar &amp; more than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sufficient for chat and IM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's one way of receiving messages, but it isn't as good for sending 
</I>&gt;<i> them. Using HTTP to send them requires some acrobatics on the server side.
</I>
&gt;<i> Using TCPConnection would just mean one process server side.
</I>How is using HTTP going to require acrobatics on the server side? I must be
misunderstanding what you are thinking, because there are dozens of
implementation of HTTP servers.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's unfortunate that port 80 would be needed to 'tunnel out', but I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realize that's the situation most people are in. But I really recommend 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that a port 80 outbound tunnel use the protocol assigned to that port - 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; via the HTTP Upgrade header.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would require that the Web author implement HTTP on his side (or at 
</I>&gt;<i> least a simple version of an HTTP server) which seems like undue work. 
</I>My opinion is that 'implement HTTP' means 'reading and parse a text stream'
- not undue work, even for a 'Web author'.

&gt;<i> What would the advantage be? We're not connecting to an HTTP server. 
</I>&gt;<i> Upgrade makes sense if you are upgrading from HTTP to something, but here 
</I>&gt;<i> we're not expecting HTTP to ever be used over the connection.
</I>The point is that since you want to initiate a connection on port 80, then
you should use the protocol assigned to that port. It has specified
mechanisms to upgrade to a proprietary protocol - it doesn't cost a whole
heck of a lot &amp; you wind up being standards compliant.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We don't want to require that authors implement an entire HTTP server 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; just to be able to switch to a proprietary protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nobody has suggested requiring an entire server. Two messages is all it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; takes. Not only does HTTP scale up well, it scales down too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, because you have to implement correct handling of everything _other_ 
</I>&gt;<i> than Upgrade: as well, even if it is to return &quot;Not Supported&quot; each time. 
</I>Good point.

&gt;<i> You have to parse headers, etc. Nobody is going to actually bother to 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly implement that, and if they don't, what's the point in 
</I>&gt;<i> pretending that they do? It would just make matters worse, with obscure 
</I>&gt;<i> per-server/client pair bugs for browsers to work around.
</I>Browsers don't need to work around a broken server, regardless of which spec
the server author didn't follow.
