</I>
The section titled &quot;the repetition model for repeating form controls&quot; 
defines the &quot;repeating form controls model&quot; (that term is in bold in the 
intro to that section), so I don't see what the problem is.


&gt;<i> Last, but not least, I must emphase that 'ease of typing' (or short 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes and tags) should not take over. This is because the 
</I>&gt;<i> specification may 'suffer' in the future, when new versions will be 
</I>&gt;<i> written. You should think of 'what if I will add something which also 
</I>&gt;<i> uses those keywords?'.
</I>
I agree it is a balancing act. &lt;address&gt; probably went too far for 
instance (since it isn't for any address). But type=&quot;add&quot; seems reasonably 
clear to me.


&gt;<i> Another reason for not being 'afraid' of having the code more 
</I>&gt;<i> 'talkative' is that people use specialized editors with auto-complete or 
</I>&gt;<i> WYSIWYG editors. Therefore, the amount of chars needed to type ain't 
</I>&gt;<i> really that high.
</I>
Actually in practice a lot of HTML is hand-written in tools like Notepad.


&gt;<i> Why not leave the type= attribute alone and make better use of 
</I>&gt;<i> template=. How:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. template=&quot;add|remove|move-up|move-down&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> This behaves exactly as &lt;input type=&quot;add|remove|move-up|move-down&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Note: without any specific declaration of a template ID.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. template=&quot;some-ID;(add|remove|move-up|move-down)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> See where I am going? This would behave as &lt;input
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;add|remove|move-up|move-down&quot; template=&quot;some-ID&quot;&gt;
</I>
I don't see the advantage of that. It makes it harder to implement, easier 
to get wrong, and doesn't seem to have any big benefit over the current 
system.


&gt;<i> What would probably be better:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;template&quot; for=&quot;some-template-ID&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> action=&quot;add|remove|move-up|move-down&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I know what you are thinking: that this suggestion adds even more 
</I>&gt;<i> chars for the devs to type, but this would probably better than the 
</I>&gt;<i> previous suggestion, since implementation is more straight forward and 
</I>&gt;<i> there's also better readability of the code.
</I>
It's easier to implement than your earlier suggestion, but I don't really 
see any advantage to the authors.


&gt;<i> Going back and reviewing all of the 3 suggestions ... first was the 
</I>&gt;<i> best: type=&quot;template-add&quot;. The second one requires less typing for web 
</I>&gt;<i> developers. Each suggestion has its weakness and strength.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a conclusion, any of the 3 above would be better than what's 
</I>&gt;<i> currently in the spec. I really believe something should be done (if I 
</I>&gt;<i> am not too late)... this was the only thing that really seemed 
</I>&gt;<i> 'bad'/wrong immediately after reading.
</I>
I guess I'm not convinced that we will have a problem if we go with the 
current names.
