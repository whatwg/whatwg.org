&gt;<i> Hello!

</I>&gt;<i> I took a closer look into the source code of both of the specifications.

</I>
I stick to HTML 4.01 Strict too. Why not? I don't see any advantage in
using XHTML for this spec, and as has been pointed out, IE doesn't
support XHTML.

All I can think of about the lack of an &lt;/html&gt; is -- well, it's not
finished, is it? :)

&gt;<i> Now ... both of the specs contain some of your notes, commented at the  
</I>&gt;<i> end. I'm sure this is useful for you while writing the specs, but WF 2  
</I>&gt;<i> Final shouldn't have any personal comments at the end of the document  
</I>&gt;<i> (about future versions). Same applies to WA 1.0 near finalisation.
</I>
My personal view on this is that it doesn't really matter, except for
the final version.

&gt;<i> Another suggestion would be ... split the WA 1.0 specification in multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> pages, one for each main section. Reason: the spec is already about 800kb  
</I>&gt;<i> and still has many section TBW. It's too big to load all at once :). I  
</I>&gt;<i> like the way W3C did with CSS 2 and some other specs (even if they also  
</I>&gt;<i> have some huge specs in a single file, like VoiceXML 2).
</I>
I don't think it needs splitting up; I find find-as-you-type to be more
intuitive than figuring out someone else's navigational hierarchy, and
the spec is not that huge. Gzip would be nice though.

&gt;<i> Last, but not least, please let us know about the advantages of using  
</I>&gt;<i> lang=&quot;en-GB-hixie&quot;. I'm really curious about the reason for doing so. Do  
</I>&gt;<i> you recommend I use lang=&quot;en-robodesign&quot; (and &quot;ro-robodesign&quot;) on my site  
</I>&gt;<i> :) ?
</I>
If you define the language en-robodesign and you have sufficient reason
to not use en-gb, en-us, etc. instead (e.g. an important difference that
would possibly cause meanings to come across in an incorrect manner),
then why not?
