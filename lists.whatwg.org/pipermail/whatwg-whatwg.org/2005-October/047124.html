</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> - Section 1.1: &quot;browsers prevalent in 2004&quot; - could be more specific 
</I>&gt;<i> given that the number of decently conforming HTML 4 and DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations can probably be counted on one hand (Gecko, KHTML, IE, 
</I>&gt;<i> Opera). This could better set the bar in terms of what is considered to 
</I>&gt;<i> be an acceptable implementation.
</I>
For political reasons it has been considered wiser not to actually mention 
specific UAs. (In reality, user agents like Lynx and others were also 
taken into account, actually.)


&gt;<i> - Section 1.2: perhaps &quot;strong market *demand*&quot; instead of &quot;need&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;need&quot; is hard to justify, demand is not. And it sounds better.
</I>
Fair enough.


&gt;<i> - Section 1.8: digital signatures: can you include a list of patent 
</I>&gt;<i> numbers you are concerned about? If you don't do that, you're 
</I>&gt;<i> significantly adding to the amount of work somebody has to do to 
</I>&gt;<i> consider the problem.
</I>
I am not aware of specific patent numbers.


&gt;<i> - Section 2.2: hidden: &quot;An arbitrary string that is not normally 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed to the user.&quot; Under what circumstances might a conforming UA 
</I>&gt;<i> display hidden input to a user? The HTML 4 spec makes no mention of such 
</I>&gt;<i> a circumstance.
</I>
HTML does not decide what gets shown. A stylesheet could easily say:

   input[type=hidden]:after { content: attr(value); }


&gt;<i> - It is not clear to me why we need a month and week extension to the 
</I>&gt;<i> input element. Seems like it only complicates implementation and gives 
</I>&gt;<i> people who deal with dates more rows in the matrix of things they need 
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to handle. You can easily express both with date and 
</I>&gt;<i> datetime. Furthermore, figuring out a date's week # is simple. Even more 
</I>&gt;<i> so for months. I'd just think we should think hard before duplicating 
</I>&gt;<i> avenues for the same information.
</I>
type=month: Think about entering credit card expiry dates.

type=week: This is a very frequently used data type in European industry.

While it is true that you could ask someone to use a type=&quot;datetime&quot; 
control to state their credit card expiry date, I'd suggest it would not 
be the most obvious UI.

HTH,
