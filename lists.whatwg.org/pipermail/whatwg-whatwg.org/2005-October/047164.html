</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My only question is - why?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine trying to play a game like Quake implemented in a Web

</I>Okay. Outbound messages are obviously not a problem. Accepting unsolicited
inbound messages isn't feasible (&amp; the unsolicited part is an invitation to
spam). Having the client initiate the connection &amp; then receiving/responding
to inbound requests is what it sounds like you would need.
If the browser had an HTTP daemon built-in, would that work? 

&gt;<i> Another example 
</I>&gt;<i> would be something like an IM or chat client. All the current 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of that are huge hacks that would be much 
</I>&gt;<i> simpler to implement if they could just open a TCP connection 
</I>&gt;<i> and send free-form data back and forth.
</I>I've implemented IM and chat applications with just HTTP, HTML and
Javascript. In a browser. Without plugins. The DOM Event portion of the
specification is very similar &amp; more than sufficient for chat and IM.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems bizarre to introduce this section into a Web browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment where HTTP is available to define most of the interactions 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; described in this section.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP is a stateless synchronous protocol for resource 
</I>&gt;<i> management. The TCPConnection interface is a stateful 
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous protocol for bidirectional realtime 
</I>&gt;<i> communication. They are very different.
</I>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I realize this is just a draft, but there are some odd 
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions - 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for example, the TCPConnection must use port 80 (the port 
</I>&gt;<i> that defines 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTTP), but later the communication requirements define a completely 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different and new protocol on that port:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not intended to use port 80 only; where does it say 
</I>&gt;<i> that? That's an error. It is intended to be usable on ports 
</I>&gt;<i> 80, 443, and anything greater than 1024. (80 and 443 to 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to tunnel out of psychotic firewalls, and anything 
</I>&gt;<i> greater than 1024 so that you can't talk to things like SMTP 
</I>&gt;<i> or FTP servers, something that could allow all kinds of 
</I>&gt;<i> security problems. 
</I>&gt;<i> The handshake also attempts to reduce the risk of security issues.)
</I>I misread the specification - I thought it restricted usage to just port
80/etc.
It's unfortunate that port 80 would be needed to 'tunnel out', but I realize
that's the situation most people are in. But I really recommend that a port
80 outbound tunnel use the protocol assigned to that port - via the HTTP
Upgrade header.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Once a TCP/IP connection to the remote host is 
</I>&gt;<i> established, the user 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agent must transmit the following sequence of bytes, 
</I>&gt;<i> represented here 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in hexadecimal form: 0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x0A This 
</I>&gt;<i> represents the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string &quot;Hello&quot; followed by a newline, encoded in UTF-8. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This whole section seems somewhat unnecessary. If you are trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; securely establish a connection &amp; then switch to a 
</I>&gt;<i> private/proprieatry 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol, you can use the Upgrade header to transition beyond HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once the connection is established:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.42">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.42</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We don't want to require that authors implement an entire 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP server just to be able to switch to a proprietary 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>Nobody has suggested requiring an entire server. Two messages is all it
takes. Not only does HTTP scale up well, it scales down too.
