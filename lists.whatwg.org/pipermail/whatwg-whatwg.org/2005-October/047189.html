See below.

&gt;<i> &gt; [1] <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;...This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT

</I>
I think the issue is how this action can possibly be unsafe.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would say it's OK to send a POST as a side effect because 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's going to an URL where the developer expects a POST. 
</I>&gt;<i> But that's not what the user clicking the link expects.
</I>
It has no effect on them. It merely allows the website owner to track
their clicks in the same way they already do with redirects.

&gt;<i> &gt; If you can come up with a reason why it's not safe, I'd like to hear it.
</I>&gt;<i> My initial reaction was to be concerned about a malicious link that
</I>&gt;<i> triggered a POST for a resource that becomes modified or deleted - like
</I>&gt;<i> href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dierken/?delete=39177102&amp;magic_cookie=528">http://www.flickr.com/photos/dierken/?delete=39177102&amp;magic_cookie=528</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 479cac210fc6z837c0ac708334fe6&quot;
</I>
I would certainly hope that Flickr requires authentication before an URL
like that had any effect, in which case the developer of the website
would only be able to delete their own photos, or photos of those whom
they had stolen the authentication details for. This is not exactly a
new problem.

&gt;<i> (Those freaking blockheads at Flickr just
</I>&gt;<i> deleted my picture when I pasted that URI into the browser window. Losers -
</I>&gt;<i> when will they realize that an anchor is not a UI widget. Thank goodness
</I>&gt;<i> that I don't have a pre-fetch utility running or I'd lose all my vacation
</I>&gt;<i> photos.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But of course anybody that can cause that extra attribute to appear on an
</I>&gt;<i> anchor, likely has enough control to do some damage anyway.
</I>
Exactly. If Flickr wanted to delete your photos, I don't think they'd
bother to try to fool you into clicking on a link. They'd just delete
them.
