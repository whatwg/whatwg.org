Yes. (Note that the &lt;/html&gt; tag is optional, but its absence is an 
artefact of the tools I use to generate the spec).


&gt;<i> Now ... both of the specs contain some of your notes, commented at the end.
</I>
Right, the WF2 spec contains the WF3 wishlist at the end, and the WA1 spec 
contains notes all over the place.


&gt;<i> I'm sure this is useful for you while writing the specs, but WF 2 Final 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't have any personal comments at the end of the document (about 
</I>&gt;<i> future versions). Same applies to WA 1.0 near finalisation.
</I>
Why not? People have found the WF3 notes useful. I agree they shouldn't be 
visible, but what's wrong with having them as comments?


&gt;<i> Another suggestion would be ... split the WA 1.0 specification in 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple pages, one for each main section. Reason: the spec is already 
</I>&gt;<i> about 800kb and still has many section TBW. It's too big to load all at 
</I>&gt;<i> once :). I like the way W3C did with CSS 2 and some other specs (even if 
</I>&gt;<i> they also have some huge specs in a single file, like VoiceXML 2).
</I>
I might provide a split version in due course but it would be a lot of 
work so I'm not planning on doing it any time soon. I'd rather cut 
features out, to be honest.


&gt;<i> Last, but not least, please let us know about the advantages of using 
</I>&gt;<i> lang=&quot;en-GB-hixie&quot;. I'm really curious about the reason for doing so. Do 
</I>&gt;<i> you recommend I use lang=&quot;en-robodesign&quot; (and &quot;ro-robodesign&quot;) on my 
</I>&gt;<i> site :) ?
</I>
As others have indicated, there's a spec for that language code. :-) But 
it's mostly for fun.
