It wouldn't be &quot;constant&quot; prompting, but yes, the spec does suggest that 
if you visit a dozen WordPress-hosted blogs and they all try to load a 
bunch of content onto your machine, you should probably have to give 
consent or at least be aware of what's going on.


&gt;<i> There are a whole lot of what I would call &quot;common&quot; examples like where

</I>
What's the alternative? Allowing any site to overload your machine with 
infinite amounts of content isn't really a viable solution.


&gt;<i> I can understand blocking access to that data pretty easily, but with 
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage, being in the same top-level domain doesn't even matter so 
</I>&gt;<i> it seems that one could just as easily &quot;subvert the limit&quot; that way.
</I>
The difference is that getting a new domain costs money, whereas getting a 
subdomain does not. So the cost of attacking someone with subdomains is 
much lower than with domains.


&gt;<i> I think it isn't really implemented that way anywhere though, is it?
</I>&gt;<i> That is, do browsers really share the limit across subdomains like 
</I>&gt;<i> that...
</I>
If they do not, they are likely vulnerable to this kind of griefing.
