The first statement you quote is normative (the word &quot;represents&quot; is a 
functional word in the HTML spec). The second statement you quote is not, 
it's just descriptive. The equivalent statement for &lt;footer&gt; is:

&gt;<i># The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor 
</I>&gt;<i># sectioning content or sectioning root element.
</I>
The &quot;author's data&quot; can fit equally well into a header (&quot;introductory 
aids&quot;) or a footer.


&gt;<i> Althought the specs say:

</I>&gt;<i># Footers don&#146;t necessarily have to appear at the end of a section,

You could also do:

   &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;header&gt; ... &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt; ... &lt;/footer&gt;
    ...article...
    &lt;footer&gt; ... &lt;/footer&gt;

They're more or less equivalent. Using &lt;ol&gt; highlights the importance of 
the order of the entries, using &lt;dl&gt; highlights the importance of the 
structure being pairs of names and values.

In data structure terms, &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; represent lists, whereas &lt;dl&gt; 
represents groups of tuples. But in practice a group of tuples can be 
represents as a structured list, a numbered list can be represented as a 
group of tuples where each tuple has a unique number, etc. Similarly, you 
can make &lt;table&gt;s that are functionally equivalent to &lt;dl&gt;s, and often an 
&lt;ol&gt; can be expressed as just a paragraph with comma-separated items.

There's often more than one way to do things in HTML.


&gt;<i> &gt; It's something we could add, but it's not clear that there's a

</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'm not sure if &quot;user agent can't randomly reorder its contents&quot;

</I>
The order of contents in &lt;dl&gt; isn't defined to be important, it's just 
that the order can't be arbitrarily changed by the user agent because it 
_might_ be important; unlike a &lt;ul&gt;, where (in theory, at least) the order 
could be arbitrarily changed.

(Google will sometimes take a page that is mainly a list and use that 
knowledge in generating the page's snippet in search results. It would be 
reasonable to say that Google could reorder items in a &lt;ul&gt; list, but not 
those in an &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;dl&gt; list, when doing this.)

The names are opaque -- most people who write HTML don't speak English as 
their first language, if at all, so we can't really rely on the element 
names to convey the semantics.

We couldn't use &lt;comment&gt;, some browsers default to hiding &lt;comment&gt; 
elements.

We could introduce &lt;c&gt; or &lt;info&gt;, but &lt;small&gt; has the advantage that it 
already renders in an appropriate way in legacy user agents.

One big problem with &lt;li&gt; in &lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; (beyond it not really being

We need to be compatible with the browsers. Adding new features is 
something we have to do very carefully to avoid not breaking the browsers.

If there are use cases unrelated to styling, please do bring them up. It's 
not clear what they would be. The semantics are unambiguous, so we don't 
need a container for semantic reasons, and the markup is easier to read 
with a blank line between pairs than with a new element. I'm not aware of 
any other argument for this feature.

There's no indication than an HTML solution will be developed either. So

It's not clear to me that this use case is anywhere near common enough to 
warrant dedicated support in browsers. It's already reasonably easy to 
create panoramas either using large images clipped by overflow:scroll 
elements, or using canvas. People doing more complicated things like 
panning around inside multiple panoramas will probably want to use WebGL 
to make more immersive applications. Unless those become really popular, I 
don't think there's a need for dedicated support.

If an author isn't going to use the elements like &lt;aside&gt;, then there's no 
reason to believe they'll use &lt;maincontent&gt; either.

As far as I can tell, all content that isn't main content fits into one of 
the existing elements, so I don't see the problem if the author _is_ going 
to use them.

&quot;Exhaustive&quot; makes it sounds like it would be exhausting to do it, but I

anyway, by a &lt;div&gt; if nothing else, and it is trivial to change those 
&lt;div&gt;s into the appropriate &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, or &lt;aside&gt; elements.

Given that, I don't see how it could be more convenient to wrap the

wrap it, presumably.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The read question for me is: What is the problem of having the

Do you have any examples where it wouldn't work?


&gt;<i> &gt; If you just want to group some elements together without giving them

</I>&gt;<i> But that fails to answer the question. It seems obvious that what

</I>&gt;<i> div=&quot;main&quot;, div=&quot;content&quot; and the like are a common paradigm 
</I>&gt;<i> (anecdotally - I have not done an analysis of any large database).

I think they're more likely there for styling reasons, for which &lt;div&gt; is 
perfectly suited.

</I>
Well, all solutions without problems are de-facto not in the spec, but 
that doesn't mean they have been rejected, because to be rejected they 
have to be considered and evaluated, and to be evaluated they have to be 
considered in the context of a problem, and without a problem that can't 
be done. So no, I stand by my statement: without a problem, the solution 
isn't rejected, it's just not considered.

Given the number of people who see the spec only doing things one way and

Well, you'll notice I haven't used such esoteric styles. :-)

The styles used in the spec are all styles that I have come across in the 
wild, including the one people quote above.

The problem is that if we change this, we are also changing how all 
existing documents get processed.


&gt;<i> How badly would this actually break existing parsers? Could it really be

&lt;style scoped&gt; was carefully designed to not affect legcy content, and to 
be usable with legacy user agents. Not sure what you mean regarding 
&lt;address&gt;.


&gt;<i> And again, it isn't evident to me that pages *are* written with the 
</I>&gt;<i> assumption that robots work this way, as evidenced by WordPress's 
</I>&gt;<i> assignment of tags on a post-by-post basis[2], marked up with 
</I>&gt;<i> rel=tag[3], posts themselves being marked up with &lt;article&gt;, and 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple &lt;article&gt;s being displayed at once in the post listing views. 
</I>&gt;<i> As WordPress is currently the most popular blogging platform on the 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet[4], it represents significant existing usage of the attribute.
</I>
What we've found with other things in HTML is that people used them 
incorrectly, thinking they were using them correctly, but actually relied 
on the processing they were having despite it not being what htey 
intended. (For example, authors would give namespaces that were bogus, 
thinking they were making their pages XML-compatible, whereas in fact if 
they were processed as XML their pages would fall apart, since they were 
in fact relying on the processing of their content as HTML for it to work.)

This is why I am very skeptical about changing the semantics like this.

Now if you convince consumers of this link type that they should honour 
&lt;article&gt; after all, and it turns out this improves compatibility with the 
Web rather than breaking it, then that would be a reason to fix the spec.
