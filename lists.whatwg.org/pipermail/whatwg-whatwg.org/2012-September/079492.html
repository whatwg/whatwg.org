</I>
That's not really a viable solution. Many authors take little care i making their pages load fast, but browser implementors still consider it important to load them fast.

&gt;<i> It will also help with backwards compatibility to have the style available.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img style=&quot;width: 10em&quot; src=&quot;image-320x200.jpg&quot; set=&quot;image-320x200.jpg 320 200 10k, image-640x400.jpg 640 400 40k, image-1280x800.jpg 1280 800 150k&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The dimensions here are in image pixels, not CSS pixels.  The set would include the 'src' image to give the declared image pixel size. The byte size and perhaps height could be optional.
</I>
The layout size of that &lt;img&gt; element is not computable until all external stylesheets have loaded, as you have written it.

&gt;<i> In other cases, browsers could either delay loading the image or lookup the 'src' image in the set to obtain the declared image pixel size and use this to speculatively load an image (once the image viewport size is finalized the browser could then decide if a higher resolution image is needed and load it then if necessary).    Browsers will need to be prepared to reload a higher resolution image anyway in case of zooming in.
</I>
Speculatively loading the wrong image does not strike me as an implementation approach that we'd be interested in.

Page loading performance is very important to users, and therefore to browser implementors. I think it's important to avoid defeating important existing optimizations when adding new features.
