</I>&gt;<i> This tightly binds the list of element names in SVG to HTML, and also

</I>&gt;<i> SVG already has elements like &lt;title&gt;, &lt;a&gt; and &lt;style&gt;.

</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/svg&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &lt;title&gt; and &lt;a&gt; elements are SVGTitleElement and SVGAElement
</I>&gt;<i> respectively and not HTMLElements.
</I>&gt;<i> The section element is an SVGElement, not an HTMLElement. This isn't
</I>&gt;<i> actually defined yet, but gives SVG authors some flexibility with
</I>&gt;<i> unknown elements when embedded in HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be really unfortunate if the SVG folks were prevented from
</I>&gt;<i> using logical names like &lt;content&gt; or &lt;section&gt; because we parse them
</I>&gt;<i> into HTML.
</I>
Actually, that's intentional.  We should never introduce more naming
conflicts between SVG and HTML.  They harm our ability to use the
languages together, across the platform.


&gt;&gt;<i> Another solution could be SVG inventing their own elements for these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinds of things.  For example, #1 could be solved with an &lt;svg:span&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or &lt;svg:p&gt; element.  Having duplicate elements in multiple namespaces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is regarded as an antipattern, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SVG has a totally different font and styling model,
</I>
No it doesn't.

&gt;<i> different kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> animations, filters, etc.
</I>
All of these are intentionally being harmonized with CSS as we speak.

&gt;<i> The paragraph and span concept in SVG
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be the same thing so it's not an antipattern. You would have
</I>&gt;<i> to specify some kind of x/y coordinate and the width since SVG doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have a flow concept so there would be nothing to size or place
</I>&gt;<i> against.
</I>
No, all you have to do is define SVG positioning as being a slight
diff from absolute positioning.  Then all the sizing just falls out.

&gt;<i> Even if you could use HTML in the flow chart example it's not enough
</I>&gt;<i> to use &lt;p&gt; since that wouldn't make the green &lt;rect&gt; any larger as SVG
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have a concept of nesting text inside a rect,
</I>
The point is to replace the &lt;rect&gt;/&lt;text&gt; combo with something that
uses the CSS box model, so I can use borders and backgrounds on a box
full of text.

&gt;<i> and if you moved
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;rect&gt; to be a &lt;div&gt; now you have the problem of making sure the
</I>&gt;<i> lines that come out of the box still connect with the sides of box.
</I>
That's fine.  I can easily do it without measuring anything, and even
if I have to measure something, it'll still be easier for this
specific use-case (and plenty of other uses where I've wanted this
definitely don't need any measurement).

&gt;<i> You'd also have problems like losing access to the &lt;font&gt;'s you
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the SVG world in the embedded HTML world.
</I>
That's only a problem if you're using SVG fonts, and *not* using
@font-face to expose them to CSS proper.  It's not significant.

&gt;<i> Might be nice to add an &lt;html&gt; element with x/y width/height
</I>&gt;<i> attributes to make &lt;foreignObject&gt; easier though!
</I>
Having to pre-measure the HTML content so I know what width/height to
set it to defeats the entire point.  It removes the verbosity, but
doesn't improve the functionality.
