If you're rendering a game in realtime, the issue doesn't come up. The 
most you'll be out is a frame.

You only have to back up the canvas when you notice it's not being updated 
and there's a chance the video card is going to get upset.

This suggests that we don't need to worry about it. Do we have any 
concrete metrics on how much of a problem this actually is? Is there a way 
to force it? (Changing video driver on Windows should do it, right? Is 
there a way to do that that isn't that heavy-duty? How about on Mac or X?)

I think it makes a lot of sense for the browser to give the page an 
animation frame pronto if it has heard that the context has gone away. 
That doesn't require any special new features though.

I agree.

For applications where there is redrawing going on, I agree that it's 
basically a non-issue.

The point is 2D canvas is used for a lot of things that _never_ redraw. 
Even within the WHATWG sphere for example we have this:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html">http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html</A>

...which fetches data from the network and draws a graph. There's no 
redrawing going on.

</I>
&quot;Used&quot; and &quot;maintained&quot; are entirely orthogonal on the Web. Most pages are 
not maintained. Many actively-used apps are written by people who were 
contracted to write the app and who are no longer on retainer.


I think it's reasonable for us to add an event that fires on the &lt;canvas&gt; 
element, or on the CanvasRenderingContext2D object, when the canvas gets 
cleared because the video card is reset. I just don't expect it to be used 
very much, so I don't consider it a solution to all the problems we're 
discussing here. It's only a solution to some of the problems (namely, to 
those apps that only repaint dirty areas, and have authors who are aware 
that this problem can ever happen, and for which &quot;just reload the page&quot; 
isn't a sufficiently clean answer).

What should the event be called?

canvas.onforcerepaint?
