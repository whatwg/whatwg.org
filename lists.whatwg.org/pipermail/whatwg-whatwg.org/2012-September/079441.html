I agree, string manipulation is *not* what we want here.

&gt;<i> Given `srcset=&quot;img2.jpg 2x 300w, img3.jpg 600w 2x&quot;`, I can only envision a
</I>&gt;<i> classList-style API returning something like one of the following:

</I>&gt;<i> 1) [ &quot;img2.jpg&quot;, &quot;2x&quot;, &quot;300w&quot;, &quot;img3.jpg&quot;, &quot;600w&quot;, &quot;2x&quot; ]
</I>&gt;<i> This obviously isn&#8217;t ideal where authors will have no idea what information
</I>&gt;<i> is being manipulated without keeping constant tabs on the current index as
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the string in the markup. Even if the order of these separate
</I>&gt;<i> concerns were normalized, the inclusion or omission of any individual aspect
</I>&gt;<i> of a rule would mean a flurry of `console.log`s in order to figure out which
</I>&gt;<i> index represented which concern &#8212; or careful counting of spaces in one&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> markup, which certainly seems error-prone to me. I know I would certainly
</I>&gt;<i> make mistakes, there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) [ &quot;img2.jpg 2x 300w&quot;, &quot;img3.jpg 600w 2x&quot; ]
</I>&gt;<i> We&#8217;re still left parsing space-seperated strings for relevant information,
</I>&gt;<i> albeit smaller ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t feel there&#8217;s much of a case to be made in favor of writing regular
</I>&gt;<i> expressions to parse and manipulate strings, rather than manipulating
</I>&gt;<i> elements and attributes &#8212; though, as always, I&#8217;m happy to reach out to the
</I>&gt;<i> author community and ask. If I&#8217;m completely off-base here &#8212; and I may well
</I>&gt;<i> be &#8212; I&#8217;d certainly be interested in reading more about the plans for an API.
</I>

Might I propose an option 3 (which is in no way a vote of support for
Hixies suggested srcset, I like the proposed video-like syntax far
more):

[{ image: 'img2.jpg', density: '2x', query: '300w' }, { image:
'img3.jpg', density: '2x', query: '600w' }]

If the values are actually keyed to something predictable, we might
stand some chance of actually reading/manipulating them without having
to determine which value is which if they are out of order (it stand
to reason the browser would have done this already, so&#8230;)

Cheers,

Aaron
