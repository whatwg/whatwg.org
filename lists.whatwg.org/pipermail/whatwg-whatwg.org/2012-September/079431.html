(regarding &lt;picture&gt;)

&gt;<i> I don't understand why it's more intuitive and easier. It seems way
</I>&gt;<i> more unwieldly.
</I>
Personally, I consider &lt;picture&gt; with &lt;source&gt; to be very similar to
using ATOM &lt;enclosure&gt;s in podcasting. The relation &#8211; there are several
sub-resources that represent (more or less) one logical resource &#8211;
directly maps to a container element with other elements in it.

Having &lt;source&gt; elements would also allow to support future image
formats while still having a fallback via content-type.

[&#8230;]

&gt;<i> Manipulating &lt;picture&gt; from script would be a huge pain -- you'd have
</I>&gt;<i> to be manipulating lots of elements and attributes.
</I>
Well, is manipulating &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; from script a huge pain?

I actually have one use case that would benefit from having separate
elements instead of an attribute &#8211; replacing &lt;source&gt; elements with
links to their content for accessability purposes. I did something like
this when I hacked elinks to (badly) support HTML5 media elements
&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/html5-media-elements-in-elinks">http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/html5-media-elements-in-elinks</A>&gt;.

Consider that any attribute microsynthax would introduce a burden on
programmatic DOM manipulation, as the attribute would have to be
parsed separately. &#8222;Do X for every &lt;source&gt; child element&#8220; is
cognitively cheap in comparison to maintaining a mental model of the
attribute in question &#8211; different from other mental models used in HTML
&#8211; in your working memory.

Furthermore, introducing an API would not help the use case of just
parsing HTML in, say, Python, to programatically download all images
from a page (or something like that).

&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, with your proposal, would this be valid, to address the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bandwidth-only use case?:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;img src=&quot;normal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;high.jpg 2x, normal.jpg 1x&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [&#8230;]
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Would also like to see if there's a way of using srcset to hint to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the UA that it can skip the image under low throughput conditions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e.g. GPRS. Same would apply to image-set in CSS
</I>
This reminds me that ATOM &lt;enclosures&gt; have a byte length. Surfing via
mobile, I certainly know that I would like images to show if they can
be downloaded in a reasonable time &#8211; but I want to skip 5MB photos.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to other existing and future media queries, some of which may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually be useful. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a) using the 'monocrhome' MQ to serve gray scale images to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; black-and-white printers or e-ink displays. Displaying a color

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different colors of similar luminosity would be impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distinguish in a monochrome environment. I expect this need to grow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together with the increasing popularity of HTML based ebooks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a real use case or a theoretical one? Until we didn't support

</I>&gt;<i> they only mentioned dimensions as being the issue.
</I>
There seem to be quite some web devices that use black-and-white epaper.
In a world in which people optimize content for mobile, tablets and
accessability, I would certainly consider this when making a site.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXZDn2Ia9js">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXZDn2Ia9js</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt; b) Microsoft is proposing a MQ which lets you detect that the UA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has been put in hight contrast mode (for accessibility reasons),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that your content should follow along.
</I>
Wouldn't it be better if content would be high-contrast always? Making
things optional may lead to fragmentation, consider media container
formats where streaming is optional and Ogg. Having a slight contrast
problem myself, I can attest to the fact that my eyes do not have
support for media queries. Gray-on-grey text and graphics need to die.

[&#8230;]

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) you syntax is terser, which is in generally a good thing, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think it crosses the limit, as a large number of people have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expressed confusion as to w and h were min or max, for example. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extra verbosity of my syntax gets you an extra bit of clarity,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admittedly at the cost of having multiple elements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that there's a small learning curve, but it seems pretty easy
</I>&gt;<i> to understand. Do we really want to trade the small learning curve
</I>&gt;<i> for a perpetuity of verbosity?
</I>
As a programmer using Python, I am would argue for the latter. If
markup is easier to read and understand for humans, people make fewer
errors. Certainly, in uncommon cases (I consider &lt;p&gt; a common case)
verbosity is helpful for both learning and readability.

&gt;<i> Fundamentally, a multiple-element solution here is simply a
</I>&gt;<i> non-starter, IMHO. The pros of the multielement solution with verbose
</I>&gt;<i> media queries are about the same in magnitude as the pros of the
</I>&gt;<i> one-attribute solution with terse syntax, but the cons of the terse
</I>&gt;<i> syntax are small whereas the cons of the multiple-element syntax are
</I>&gt;<i> immense. For the multi-element solution to be a net positive over the
</I>&gt;<i> one-attribute solution, the magnitude of its &quot;pros&quot; would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> enormous.
</I>
Does readability count?
