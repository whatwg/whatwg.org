</I>&gt;<i> delivering appropriate alternate content.
</I>
There are several problems here. One is that designing &lt;video&gt; to fall 
back to rendering its contents in certain cases leads to a very flickery 
experience -- e.g. on a slow network:

   &lt;video&gt;
    &lt;!-- here the browser doesn't know of a &lt;source&gt;, so show fallback? --&gt;
    &lt;source ...&gt;
    &lt;!-- ok now we know of a &lt;source&gt;, so show the video, even though we 
         haven't yet downloaded it? --&gt;
    &lt;!-- but maybe now we know the &lt;source&gt; is not supported, so show the 
         fallback again? --&gt;
    &lt;source ...&gt;
    &lt;!-- ah, now we have a video we know we support, so show it --&gt;
   &lt;/video&gt;
   &lt;!-- oops, turns out the one we support is broken after all, show 
        fallback? --&gt;

It just doesn't work very well.


&gt;<i> Even if we eventually get a common codec (which I&#151;perhaps overly 
</I>&gt;<i> pessimistically&#151;feel is unlikely), authors are already using the &lt;video&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element without supplying whatever that eventual codec will be, and 
</I>&gt;<i> users are suffering without reasonable fallbacks.
</I>
Right now two codecs support everyone, and one of those is what you'd have 
to use for the fallback anyway, so when would you need to show fallback if 
the browser supports &lt;video&gt; at all?


&gt;<i> As it stands, it's almost better (and certainly easier) for authors to 
</I>&gt;<i> default to Flash video and use the existing, declarative fallback 
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour of the &lt;object&gt; element to use a &lt;video&gt; element instead. That 
</I>&gt;<i> can't be in the best interest of the open web.
</I>
Why not? So long as they provide a non-proprietary non-encumbered 
alternative, there doesn't see to be much difference what the default is.

My recommendation would be to develop a specification for this (or use the 
one(s) already available for this purpose), and in that specification 
define how it is added to HTMLMediaElement, much as you suggest:

&gt;<i> partial interface HTMLMediaElement {
</I>&gt;<i>   [...]
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>
(I don't have the bandwidth to define how to extract this kind of thing 
from each video format. Even trying to define what little the spec already 
says has required hours of reading obscure specifications and that's 
without even testing to see if those specs match reality.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The effective (internal) preload state should be defined.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It should also be defined that with preload=metadata, readyState 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; should never go beyond HAVE_CURRENT_DATA, even for a data: URL or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; otherwise fully cached resource.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Making it non-conforming for a user agent to aggressively cache resources,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially if the user has asked for it, is a non-starter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Aggressively caching does not necessarily need to be exposed to scripts.
</I>
This doesn't make any sense. Making the API just flat out lie about what 
is cached would just mean that everyone has to remove the attribute to 
figure out what's actually going on. It would turn preload=metadata from a 
hint saying to avoid network traffic, to a flag that cripples the API. And 
it wouldn't, as far as I can tell, make any difference to compatibility. 
There will be browsers that don't preload with preload=auto, for instance, 
so it's not like authors can end up depending on 'loadeddata' or 'canplay' 
firing to start playback with no other way to start it. Plus, even if a 
page did end up waiting for a caching even that never comes to start 
playback, the user can just tell the UA to start playback instead of 
waiting for the page to do it, and then all the events will fire.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, the spec is as detailed as it can be here 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; given the range of possible implementation strategies that we need 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to allow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Could you give a concrete example of what you are concerned about?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;video src=x preload=none onsuspend=&quot;makeSiteWork()&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then we should stop firing &quot;suspend&quot; in the preload=none case,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or fire it in every case if preload=none, even if the UA immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unsuspends.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe.
</I>
Neither of these seem like a good idea to me, They're both lying. 
'suspend' should fire when the network traffic suspends (or when it 
finishes, or when it doesn't start). Having it fire at times where we're 
still getting data, is silly.


&gt;<i> &gt; But I'm not convinced anyone is going to hook into onsuspend in this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way. There'd be no point as far as I can tell, and it's more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated than the alternative (just run the code straight away 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without waiting).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're not convinced that people on the Web do things in ways more 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated and fragile than necessary, just because it's possible?
</I>
Not for cases such as this, no. And if they do, it'll still work, you just 
have to wait for the entire video to download.

The category &quot;interactive content&quot; doesn't mean it's interactive, per se, 
it just means it's non-conforming for the element to be placed in other 
interactive content.

The UA controls of a media element themselves should always be focusable 
and interactive. They're separate from the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements.

This is a Quality of Implementation issue, basically. I believe there's 
nothing inherently in the API that would make accuracy to such timecodes 
impossible.

It's error-handling behaviour. The reason you'd draw a &lt;video&gt; is to do 
frame capture, but if you're in HAVE_NOTHING or HAVE_METADATA then you 
don't have the current frame.

If you want to draw the poster, you can do that easily enough already.

It's hypothetically a feature of the animated image format. In practice I
