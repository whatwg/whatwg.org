I'm not crazy about any of them. They all seem like sticky wickets to me.
Implementation issues aside, they are at the wrong level of abstraction, so
they obfuscate the real reason for their existence.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or applications for which the output is basically static data and the

</I>

Sure, but those use cases will be in the minority, and we're already
talking about a very rare occurrence in the first place, so the odds of a
very expensive regeneration on a lost context must be near Lotto levels.

I think it makes the most sense to add a context lost handler to the spec
and leave it up to developers to redraw the canvas. It's straightforward to
understand and to implement. It has the distasteful downside of forcing
some developers to add a few lines of code to their existing apps, but if
the apps are used and maintained is it really that big of a deal?
