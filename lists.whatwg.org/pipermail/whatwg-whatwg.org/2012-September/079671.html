Do we have any data on this? If this really is a concern, it may suggest 
that maybe the whole path syntax should be rethought. As it stands it 
already has quite a lot of repetition. For example, look at the amount of 
repetition in the examples for A/a in the SVG spec.


&gt;<i> &gt; What's wrong with A/a? It seems to be equivalent to arcTo(). Is it

I don't really follow.

The main use case for arcTo() is rounded corners. With A/a, these are 
trivial. Consider a 300x150 rectangle with 10px radius corners, top left 
corner at 0,0. There's no trig necessary, you just give the points on each 
side, with the radius as offset:

   d=&quot;M10,0 H290 A10,10 0 0 1 300,10
            V140 A10,10 0 0 1 290,150
            H10  A10,10 0 0 1   0,140
            V10  A10,10 0 0 1  10,0   
      Z&quot;

(The Z isn't really necessary.)

If anything, I'd say this is better than what you have to do with 
arcTo(), since with that one you have to give both the corner coordinate 
and the destination coordinate, rather than just the latter.

Could you elaborate on what exactly it is that is being done here? If 
there were some examples showing the problems that would really help.
