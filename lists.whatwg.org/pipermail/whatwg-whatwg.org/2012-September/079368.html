</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My preferred option would be to make a generic context lost event for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I'm interested to hear what people have to say about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Realistically, there are too many pages that have 2D canvases that are

</I>&gt;<i> the data&quot; to be adopted. How exactly this is implemented is a quality of
</I>&gt;<i> implementation issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It would be interesting to hear what other implementors have done to work
around this. Chrome has code to do most of canvas in hardware and they are
able to run it on devices with limit resources.

I do think that Erik's request has merit. With regular images, you can
always remove it from memory if needed and retrieve it from the history or
reload it from the original source.
An implementor could save a bitmap representation of the canvas to its
cache but this is probably slow if it has to be read back from the GPU and
the image could potentially be large.

If there was a callback for context loss and if the user had set it, a
browser could throw the entire canvas out and ask for it to be re-rendered
if the canvas is shown again. This would even make sense if you don't have
a HW accelerated canvas.

There would be no backward compatibility issue either. If the user doesn't
set the callback, a browser would have to do something reasonable to keep
the canvas bitmap around.
