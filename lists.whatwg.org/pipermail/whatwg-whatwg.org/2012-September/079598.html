I've updated the spec to have guards in place for 'pagehide' and 'unload'.

(Not yet 'beforeunload'. Should we do that too?)

Yeah, the spec's behaviour is intentional here. The error in the spec was 
just that it still fired unload again. I've fixed that.

When it's same origin, you really have no way to know what's going on. The 
page could trivially pushState() a continuously changing URL, for example, 
and could serve random files from the server for any URL.

The spec now clearly requires the parser-stopping behaviour.

</I>
Aborting a document happens for many reasons other than stop(). For 
example, document.open(), navigation, the user hitting &quot;STOP&quot;, going 
back() in history, etc. In particular, &quot;The End&quot; can block on network, so 
we definitely don't want to require that UAs do that when you close a tab, 
for example.

Yeah, this is an oversight as specced. Fixed.

</I>
The existing text in the spec step 4 is attempting to prevent a page from 
having you click on a link to &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://paypal.com/">http://paypal.com/</A>&quot;&gt; and in the 
unload change that to a location.href=&quot;<A HREF="http://paypa1.com/">http://paypa1.com/</A>&quot; navigation, or 
something similar but with the user typing in the location bar and the 
page hijacking that navigation.

If it turns out that you can't ever block a cross-origin navigation, 
though, that's a lot easier to fix. :-)

It's not that simple though. Browsers agree on this page that we should go 
to the second of the two cross-origin navigations (replace &quot;false&quot; with 
&quot;1&quot; in the script to run the test):

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1778">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1778</A>

This one too (frame nav):

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1780">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1780</A>

So this is presumably specific to fragment identifiers. And sure enough, 
when we change the latter one above to changing to a fragment identifier, 
it works as you describe:

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1782">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1782</A>

(Things aren't so simple in this example (same-page nav):

   <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1784">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1784</A>

...where Firefox no longer exhibits the restraint we're looking for here, 
but Chrome and Opera still do.)

Anyway, yeah, looks like step 6 is just bogus. I've removed it. This now 
means that fragment identifier navigations just happen without screwing 
around with ongoing loads.


&gt;<i> == Issue #2 ==

</I>&gt;<i> Suppose again that evil.com controls a frame F, and evil.com causes F to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   1. load a.html

</I>&gt;<i>   3. start loading b.html

</I>&gt;<i> This caused a problem for us in Firefox because we create a session

</I>&gt;<i> whichever session history entry happens to be after the current one, 
</I>&gt;<i> assuming that it was the session history entry we created earlier. [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fix for this bug is not as simple as merely ensuring that the

</I>&gt;<i> behaving correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We fixed this bug by cancelling the load of b.html when you go back.

</I>&gt;<i> Notice that this means we're cancelling an outstanding network load due

</I>&gt;<i> the web if the navigation from a.html to a.html#h is a history

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I /think/ this is what the spec says should happen, but I'm not sure. 
</I>&gt;<i> But matching the spec here would be difficult in our current

</I>
The way the spec is written, if I'm not mistaken, you only create the new 
session history entry when you're ready to make it active. So I don't 
think the spec has the problem you ran into; as you describe, it just 
works.

However, if it doesn't match browsers, that's of little comfort.

I've changed the spec so that traversing the history by a delta always 
cancels any pending navigations unless you're in the middle of an unload, 
in which case it just aborts the algorithm entirely.

I've also made back()/forward()/go() not work during the document's unload 
handler, since that could be used for griefing. I'm tempted to disable it 
entirely for all docs a la alert(), but I've no idea if that's Web- 
compatible and I suspect not.
