Yeah, this should be changed to use toDataURLHD.

</I>
You had a bug in WebKit according to the old spec, but since none of the 
browsers correctly implemented the resolution stuff, I've changed the way 
to the spec does it and now it's the test that's got the bug. :-)

Based on the above, I haven't changed anything in the spec.

It seems pretty reasonable to me, to be honest.

We could add an event that fires on ImageData (or even ArrayBuffer) that 
fires when the data is available. If we add it to ArrayBuffer it's 
something that could be used in other contexts, too.

Is this something that people think we should do? If so, should we add it 
to TypedArray generically?

I haven't yet added canvas to workers, but it is something that is on the 
list of things to add. I have been waiting for implementations of workers 
(including shared workers and message ports) and canvas (including the new 
path APIs) to mature before adding the combination.
