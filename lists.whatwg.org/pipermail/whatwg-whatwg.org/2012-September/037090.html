I had believed that the article element would fulfil the requirement. But
the below suggests that my assumption may be incorrect...

That is technically true, but not useful. The body element also contains a
page's header, footer, general linking buttons (share/like/rate/...),
navigation, advertising, tracking tokens, responses to the content, and
more.

</I>&gt;<i> Well, the &quot;content&quot; is what is left after you take out the stuff that

</I>
Yes. If we have elements for all such things, the logical conclusion is
that we don't need one for &quot;the main content&quot;. In practice, this also
supposes that authors use those elements.

As far as I can tell, those asking for such an element do not believe we
do have all the other elements, and/or are not convinced they for a
sufficient proportion of cases they are going to be used as designed.

To turn the question around, if it is more convenient for authors to
identify the main content, and not think about the classification of other
parts, should we offer that facility as part of the platform? Or does it
make sense to say that only the exhaustive identification of all
supplementary content is an appropriate way to mark up a page anyway?

&gt;&gt;<i> The read question for me is: What is the problem of having the content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the same level of &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; (for example inside an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt;)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can't we treat everything inside an article which is not in &lt;header&gt; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;footer&gt; is the real &quot;content&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the intent of the spec, right.
</I>
In that case I think the spec is wrong. I suspect that real content will
fail to match this intent in a significant proportion of cases. I also
suspect that allowing authors to identify the &quot;main&quot; content would
significantly alleviate the problems caused...

</I>
But that fails to answer the question. It seems obvious that what
advocates of a content element want to do is group some elements together
and give that group a special meaning. I believe that is why div=&quot;main&quot;,
div=&quot;content&quot; and the like are a common paradigm (anecdotally - I have not
done an analysis of any large database).

</I>&gt;<i> This role is unnecessary in HTML documents, since browsers can skip the

Again, that presupposes that all the non-main content is identified.

This makes no sense. You have very clearly rejected the idea of an element
to group the main content, and I am not sure how that is unclear.

</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on what this element would do and/or mean?
</I>
It would act as a grouping construct (a la div, section, or article) for
the &quot;primary content&quot; of a page. It could be used for navigation of a page
by blocks (see the discussions on tabindex scope and navigation cycles and
mechanisms in HTML, and before that in SVG), for indexing content across a
site, for adaptation to different layouts, or whatever else has motivated
the people who have been using a div to identify their main content.

It is more or less impossible to define that exhaustively (since it
depends on the author's judgement of what their main content is), a
working explanation of what it isn't should be sufficient. In case this
element does seem warranted, I would  offer as a starting point

This element identifies the principal content of the page. It is designed
to exclude page components such as site navigation, comments, headers and
footers, and others that are common to a number of different pages.

I'm sure smart people can improve that significantly.
