Canvas GPU acceleration today is done via transform3d and transitions.
Yes, you are quite likely to notice the difference on a mobile device.

Other than that; there are some niche instances of using drawImage 
repeatedly, such as the Fish demo.

Largely, if you're thinking GPU acceleration, you're thinking WebGL.
And yes, you're going to notice a big difference there, too.

Most [installed] GPUs are not able to accelerate the Canvas path drawing 
mechanism.
They are able to take an array of floats for WebGL, though.

&gt;<i> GPU-acceleration, so I wouldn't be surprised if implementations compromised
</I>&gt;<i> on something like this.
</I>
What is really meant here by Canvas GPU acceleration?

Largely, the issues we have are with filters: an item that Vincent from 
Adobe and Rik have both brought up.

I've been frustrated a few times following Chrome development as they 
speed up the MS Fish Tank demo at the cost of ruining the performance of 
pen input/drawing programs.
It's bounced back and forth a few times now.
