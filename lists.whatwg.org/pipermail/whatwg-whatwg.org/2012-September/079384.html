</I>
There are ways to make it work without forgoing acceleration, e.g. taking 
regular &quot;backups&quot; of the canvas contents, remembering every instruction 
that was sent to the canvas, etc.


&gt;<i> Erik's proposal doesn't worsen the problem in anyway --- it acknowledges

</I>
The problem is that there is content that doesn't recover, and assumes the 
problem doesn't exist. That makes it our problem.

This isn't an issue of the spec -- there is existing content that would be 
affected.

This is an interesting idea... do other vendors want to provide something 
like this?
