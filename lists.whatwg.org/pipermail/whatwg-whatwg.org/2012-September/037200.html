alt=&quot;(an image)&quot;, or alt=&quot;DSK1298.JPG&quot;, or similar such strings, are 
terrible alternative text. They're not uncommon. (I don't have numbers at 
hand. I did look into it a few years ago. It would certainly be good to 
have someone do more recent research.)


&gt;<i> &gt; A user converting 100,000 PDFs to HTML isn't going to be entering 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alternative texts for each image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such bulk conversions can be useful for many purposes, but the results

</I>&gt;<i> There is no reason to prevent validators from saying this, in their own 
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>
There is a reason; it's been explained in some detail in this thread. 
Briefly again: If they're not silent, the authors of those tools will be 
pressured into making the images have bogus alternative texts that are not 
programmatically detectable, by people comparing such tools using 
validators. Better to have the output be clearly non-conforming, but for 
the validators not to complain about it by default.


&gt;<i> Take the example of converting one non-HTML document with images to HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> format. Should the result of an automatic converter that generates &lt;img&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> tags without alt attributes be considered as valid as the result of 
</I>&gt;<i> human conversion with alt attributes added or semi-automatic conversion 
</I>&gt;<i> (where a human is prompted for entering alt texts)?
</I>
It's not valid to omit alt=&quot;&quot; in these cases. We just don't want 
validators to say that it's not valid.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is should-level non-conforming and has no reason to be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only reason it's not entirely non-conforming (&quot;must&quot; rather than

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when you have an empty paragraph that you're going to fill in later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But maybe we should tighten this up again, e.g. for interactive

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot imagine a good reason to include an unnamed control, so yes.

</I>
Hm, that's a good point. I don't think there's a good way to 
programmatically detect whether there's a label or not, so I'll just leave 
it as a SHOULD for now.

This is only a limitation of the state of the art. There's no way to 
detect these valid cases vs the invalid ones, and reporting false 
negatives (&quot;you're invalid&quot; when it is valid) is worse than false 
positives (&quot;you're valid&quot; when it is not).
