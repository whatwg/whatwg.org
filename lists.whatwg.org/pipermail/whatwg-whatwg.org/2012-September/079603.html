Thanks for the details...

&gt;<i>From a performance point of view I'm encouraging my clients (and
</I>others are too) to load third-party content asynchronously and where
possible after onload.

I've seen big variations in download times from third-parties like
Facebook and Twitter (measured using synthetic monitoring that
generates waterfalls for each page load) and of course these affect
when the onLoad event fires.
