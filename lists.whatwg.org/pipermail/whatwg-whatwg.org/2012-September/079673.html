Yes, the A/a commands (ArcBetween) are elliptical-only, which is
problematic.  As part of our revamping of paths, particular the arc
syntaxes, I'll be proposing a circular ArcBetween as well.  That
eliminates the repetition.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; What's wrong with A/a? It seems to be equivalent to arcTo(). Is it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; arc() that you want to add? I'm very confused.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, no, they're *completely* different.  arcTo() is *great*, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's convenient and solves a useful problem (rounding a corner) without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you having to do much math.  For A, you have to determine the start/end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points on the circle yourself, usually involving trig.  The only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similarity between the two commands is that they both draw an arc as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of their operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really follow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main use case for arcTo() is rounded corners. With A/a, these are
</I>&gt;<i> trivial. Consider a 300x150 rectangle with 10px radius corners, top left
</I>&gt;<i> corner at 0,0. There's no trig necessary, you just give the points on each
</I>&gt;<i> side, with the radius as offset:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    d=&quot;M10,0 H290 A10,10 0 0 1 300,10
</I>&gt;<i>             V140 A10,10 0 0 1 290,150
</I>&gt;<i>             H10  A10,10 0 0 1   0,140
</I>&gt;<i>             V10  A10,10 0 0 1  10,0
</I>&gt;<i>       Z&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The Z isn't really necessary.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anything, I'd say this is better than what you have to do with
</I>&gt;<i> arcTo(), since with that one you have to give both the corner coordinate
</I>&gt;<i> and the destination coordinate, rather than just the latter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on what exactly it is that is being done here? If
</I>&gt;<i> there were some examples showing the problems that would really help.
</I>
You are looking at the simplest possible use-case for A/a, nearly the
only case that can be done without trig, where you're starting and
stopping the arc at a quarter-turn.  Try virtually anything more
complex, like rotating the square 45deg.  Using arcTo it's still
trivial - you just need to know enough trig to figure out that the
corners are now at (0, 1.414), etc., and the command takes care of the
rest for you.  With A/a, you need to do a bit more to translate the
points of the diamond into the start/end of the arc.

Don't even get me started on trying to do a 5-pointed star with rounded corners.

In general, if you can do a sharp corner, you can do a rounded corner
with arcTo.  You need no additional information.  arcBetween almost
always needs significantly more information.
