Actually no need to file a bug, just mentioning it in this mailing list is 
enough for it to get on the radar.

If you do want to file a bug, though, you can. I recently created this 
short URL:

   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/newbug">http://whatwg.org/newbug</A> 

You can also use the little box in the spec at the bottom right, it files 
a bug also.

(I only guarantee responses to new feedback on the spec sent to this 
mailing list; bugs may not get detailed responses, though they will all 
get looked at.)

There's always room for discussion. Discussions that don't introduce new 
content may get very short answers though. :-)

These use cases seem solid.

Adding such filters would be pretty useful...

Is there any chance of adding filters to this also?


&gt;<i> I can see 2 ways of adding this:

</I>&gt;<i> with blending. This is what is currently in the draft spec (

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. create a new attribute on the context called 'globalBlendOperation' that

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/rawfile/tip/compositing/index.html#blend-mode">https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/rawfile/tip/compositing/index.html#blend-mode</A>)
</I>
Either (or both) of these seems reasonable to me. Would it make sense to 
have the canvas section defer to this spec for all blending, filtering, 
and compositing?

I haven't added grouping, for the reason described above. But if it's 
something that could benefit from native support from browsers and browser 
vendors want to implement it, we can definitely add something like this.

I agree that it would be nice to have a generic way to mutate 
ArrayBuffers. I recommend bringing this up with the editor of the Typed 
Array specification.

ImageData actually holds an actual ArrayBuffer, so we're pretty much 
there.
