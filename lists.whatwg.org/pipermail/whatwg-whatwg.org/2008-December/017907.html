Styling is done in css.

I don't have time to go into the all the problems with CSSOM here.
Shortcomings of the CSSOM 'views' module were discussed on www-style.
'VIews' is not the only CSSOM module that has problems.

Where are you getting this information?


&gt;<i> but scripts use certain features only on their own browsing context, so that
</I>&gt;<i> may be moved from that to global scope, removing the whole window object
</I>&gt;<i> from scope (for current javascript you can write
</I>&gt;<i> window.window.window.window.window... and get the same as nothing)
</I>
The closest definition to 'nothing' would be the value undefined. I do
not know of a browser where - window.window.window === undefined is
true by default. I get window.

A relevant example would be useful.

The closes thing we got to an example of invalid html is TJ post about
jquery validation plugin. If you click throuh, there is an demo using
a minlength custom attribute. The attribute may have the effect the
author wanted it to have in a set of browses he is concerned about.
That &quot;effect&quot; and the &quot;set of browsers&quot; could be more clearly
demonstrated in an example that shows only that, as well as edge cases
where results may vary.

If you can't define clearly what can be reasonably expected of a piece
of (invalid) code, then nothing can be reasonably expected of it. It's
not a good to write code that can't have an expected outcome.
