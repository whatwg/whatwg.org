I think you need to think about not only alien pages that want
to do you harm, but also about web applications f ex on 
intranets that solve a complex task through the use of multiple
windows. I've had users of the latter demand that we (the
developers) raise windows automatically based on different
events. Personally I'm not a fan of auto-raising windows (f ex
MS Windows does it too often for my taste) but I think these
users' use cases have been valid.

&gt;<i> I've now specced window.focus() and window.blur(), but mostly 
</I>&gt;<i> as no-ops. 
</I>&gt;<i> I've noted that window.focus() could trigger a notification.
</I>
I read your updated text, and while it is great that you have
added the notification stuff, I think removing focus's current
behaviour is a hard legacy to break. Even &quot;good&quot; scripts would
need to workaround it at times.

I think UAs could be encouraged to handle focus like many popup
blockers do; have a global setting to determine the default
behaviour (system focus|notification|ignore) and then being able
to override this setting for f ex selected sites or the current 
session.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Focusing an element inside a window should raise the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; window or hidden tab at the UA's discretion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the opposite about this one too, I guess it shows 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how different web users may think about their visual 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Popping a window to front on every programmatic element 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; focusing would make windows pop to front more often than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needed. Windows should be forced to front as little as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible as this is messing with the user's desktop 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience. Also regard users that don't use the standard 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows focus model (click to focus = focused window on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; top) but rather the &quot;X-mouse&quot;-model (focus follows mouse = 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; focused window may be partially obscured). If they are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typing data into a partially obscured browser window that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then calls elem.focus() to move keyboard focus, they will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get an undesired window raise.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I think it is desired to distinguish between element 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keyboard focus and window raising, and only let the latter 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be done explicitly and not as a side-effect of doing the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; former.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any reason to let the latter be done at all really.
</I>
I'm confused. I responded to this sentence in your previous mail:

  &quot;Focusing an element inside a window should raise the 
   window or hidden tab at the UA's discretion.&quot;

but now you say that this should never be done (which I think is
fine btw). What did I misinterpret?

Best regards
Mike Wilson
