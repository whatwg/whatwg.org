This is a bulk reply to a bunch of HTML5 semantics-related posts on the 
WHATWG list.

I assure you that I do take all feedback into account (and indeed I 
personally reply to every substantial point made on this list, after 
considering it and adjusting the spec if appropriate).


&gt;<i> In the end, feedback is not being used to improve the spec, but to hide 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that it is nothing else than the tyrannical imposition of 
</I>&gt;<i> browser vendors upon the entire Web. So once they go through and publish 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 as a recommendation or standard, they will use all this filtered, 
</I>&gt;<i> non-representative feedback, to claim that it was defined by the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> Web community. But the truth is that browser vendors will do whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> they please, just like they did before the W3C existed, only that they 
</I>&gt;<i> are now also trying to attach it the &quot;standard&quot; tag.
</I>
While it's certainly true that browser vendors have the ultimate power of 
implementation to override anything we put in the spec, and thus that if 
we want the spec to describe reality, we have to do whatever they do, I 
assure you that I, as editor of the spec, am trying as much as possible to 
balance the needs of all parties here, not least of which regular Web 
authors. Without buy-in from Web authors, HTML5 won't succeed either.

Could you elaborate with concrete examples showing in what ways HTML5 is 
unusable? I am highly concerned about this and really wish to fix any 
problem that serious. I'm sorry if I missed examples in your earlier 
feedback.

</I>
This recommendation is actually just &quot;paving a cowpath&quot; -- there has been 
a general trend towards &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; for marking up computer code, which 
seems to make sense on the face of it.


&gt;<i> It also makes it extremely difficult to style pre as a block for code, 
</I>&gt;<i> as the only semantic indication that the contents of the pre block are 
</I>&gt;<i> computer code is its child. You'd end up having to say &lt;pre 
</I>&gt;<i> class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; if you wanted to style pre as well.
</I>
Why not just style the &lt;code&gt;?


&gt;<i> At the same time, I still think the semantics of whether or not a &lt;pre&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> tag indicates a plaintext file, or a piece of ASCII art, or computer 
</I>&gt;<i> code, is somewhat important. However, I think this information would be 
</I>&gt;<i> more appropriately given as an attribute.
</I>
Well, authors are welcome to use the class=&quot;&quot; attribute for this purpose, 
as with any HTML element. It's not clear that there is a real need to 
provide more support for this than what we have now.

Also,

   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

...does not seem significantly more verbose than:

   &lt;pre type=&quot;code&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;

...so it's not clear to me what an attribute would get us here.

Just do:

Sure, but they're still consistent and practical...


&gt;<i> It gives us the option of using the title attribute (which has no

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then it gives us the a element solution, which is how it is already done

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And last it tells us we can use the aside element. But in this example

</I>&gt;<i> way of grouping footnotes/sidenotes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I am perfectly happy for this spec not to provide a footnote

</I>&gt;<i> alternatives and simply say it should be resolved using scripting (which

</I>
We have received significant feedback on the topic requesting that 
declarative suggestions be given here, which would not be addressed by 
omitting the section or suggesting script-based solutions.

</I>
The idea is to provide ways to mark up documents that work regardless of 
the presence or absence of styling hooks like CSS. title=&quot;&quot; provides this 
for footnotes. The grouping of footnotes isn't explicitly provided (though 
nothing stops a print UA from grouping all the title=&quot;&quot; attributes 
together at the end), but that, as was noted, is a stylistic concern.

I don't think, therefore, that the premise of your question follows.

I don't really see the problem here.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the second is a bit more muddy I think, but the important part there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is: &quot;processing BY user agents&quot;. User agents have no interest in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; semantics, so I fail to see here also why classes may be used to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microformats.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong, microformats are a good idea, but they lack the

</I>&gt;<i> or class attributes. They specify a role and pure semantics and have 
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely nothing to do with styling on their own.
</I>
I don't understand what you are saying here.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The fact that a class should be named &quot;footnote&quot; for example is only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so you will not get in trouble (unlike when you use a name like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;red&quot; or &quot;left&quot;). But this only tells me (the author) that this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; element should be styled like a footnote and for the user agent that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it should render it like a footnote. It should not tell me (or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anything else) that it IS a footnote. This would lead inevitably to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; inflexibility.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why not enclose your footnotes in &lt;aside&gt; elements?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because it isn't an aside.
</I>
What are footnotes if _not_ asides?


&gt;<i> &gt; Moreover, a note is not necessarily presented as a &quot;footnote&quot; (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moved to the end of the &quot;page&quot;), it can be shown in the margin (as in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the WHATWG version of the HTML5 spec) or in popup panels when you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; click on a word or &quot;footnote reference&quot; (similarly to definitions in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the old HTMLHelp on Windows).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very true, that is exactly what I have been saying. The current spec 
</I>&gt;<i> does not take this into account. As it stands now, I must assign a 
</I>&gt;<i> class-name to the footnote and then style (and perhaps script) based on 
</I>&gt;<i> that class-reference. But it fails to give me a proper element to do 
</I>&gt;<i> this. Like I said, I think the Mark element would be great, but then 
</I>&gt;<i> either it should get a &quot;role&quot; atribute or the examples given in the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> should give it a more flexible meaning. Footnotes (and the likes) fall 
</I>&gt;<i> in the same catagory as definitions, so why not give it an element just 
</I>&gt;<i> like it? (or broaden the meaning of the dfn-element).
</I>
I'm confused here, because on the one hand you are saying that the 
suggestions in the spec give semantics instead of making things be styled 
like footnotes, and on the other hand you are saying that what you want is 
semantics and not something style-specific.

You agree, here, that what's in the spec for notes is equivalent to a 
footnote. But &lt;aside&gt; was in fact invented precisely for this case. Yet 
you argue that &lt;aside&gt; isn't good for footnotes.

So I don't really know what to change to satisfy your feedback.

That is not a-priori a goal, no. Semantics are merely a tool we have at 
our disposal to achieve our goals of making the Web more accessible, 
powerful, and so forth.

I don't really see how the above provides any more semantics, or solves 
any more problems, than:

   &lt;abbr title=&quot;some description&quot;&gt;someword&lt;/abbr&gt;

Could you give an example of a problem faced by a user or author (or 
implementor) that your &lt;reference&gt; proposal solves?

Yeah, this is something for which a CSS solution might be better on the

I don't know what the way to track feedback to the CSS list is these 
days, maybe a more active member of the CSS working group could help us 
here? How do we follow this feedback through the CSSWG process?

</I>&gt;<i> Let's take that point by point:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; A default style when there's no CSS support: that's entirely

</I>
A default style is specifically not what is generally considered 
&quot;presentational&quot;, in that the default style can (and will) vary from UA to 
UA. The point is that there is _a_ presentation, though what it is may 
vary. This is the same reason &lt;em&gt; is not the same as &quot;italics&quot; and thus 
not the same as &lt;span&gt; with some CSS rules.


&gt;<i> -&gt; Support in accessibility tools: that's plain daydreaming: what kind 
</I>&gt;<i> of support can an AT provide without any hint on whether the &lt;mark&gt;'ed 
</I>&gt;<i> text is a search term, or the line of a code snippet that caused a 
</I>&gt;<i> crash, or the total price of the orders in a shopping cart, or whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> other usage authors may come up with?
</I>
An AT (indeed any Web browser) can provide a list of all &lt;mark&gt; elements 
and allow the user to jump to them directly. (In a visual browser one 
would imagine this as marks in the scrollbar widget, for instance.)


&gt;<i> -&gt; The ability for search engines to understand what's going on?? 
</I>&gt;<i> Comming from someone else, I'd think they are simply wrong, but comming 
</I>&gt;<i> from Ian I really hope you were joking: besides a SE would be as 
</I>&gt;<i> clueless on that aspect as an AT; this would extremelly easily abused by 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;black hat&quot; SEO, to the point of making the element completely 
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless for SEs: just a &quot;mark { display: none; }&quot; rule and a site 
</I>&gt;<i> becomes able to freely spam &quot;highlighted&quot; keywords across the entire 
</I>&gt;<i> page. And, although many SEs are capable of checking CSS sheets, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> almost trivial to achieve the same from JavaScript, and even to 
</I>&gt;<i> obfuscate the script if any SE managed to figure the trick out.
</I>
I think &lt;mark&gt;'s only use from a search engine perspective is allowing 
text to be marked up specifically _without_ it affecting the weight given 
to it by styles. For example, a search engine might well, if it 
deteremined in some sense that the markup of the page was trustworthy, 
give more weight to keywords found in &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;b&gt; elements; but it 
would be bad to give more weight to words marked with &lt;mark&gt;.


&gt;<i> -&gt; Simpler rules in CSS and other selector-like environments: I simply 
</I>&gt;<i> can't believe that this came from an editor of the CSS3 Selectors 
</I>&gt;<i> module. How much simples is &quot;mark&quot; than &quot;.match&quot;, &quot;.crash_line&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;.total&quot;, and so on? The only difference is a single dot; plus the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> that classes give much more flexibility that directly styling (or

</I>&gt;<i> or SEs to differentiate then, BTW).
</I>
Avoiding the use of classes, whether you think it is significant or not, 
is a simplification.


&gt;<i> -&gt; The usual benefits of semantics. Honestly, that's a really good

</I>&gt;<i> every alternative may improve the specification).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The _id_ attribute represents an element unique identifier in the

</I>&gt;<i> one character. In this context, a subtree is either a whole document 
</I>&gt;<i> tree, or a tree of Node instances containing HTMLElements and 
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected from any HTML document; a subtree of a document tree is 
</I>&gt;<i> contained in a subtree of the first type, thus id values must be unique 
</I>&gt;<i> in the containing document (e.g. a duplicate id inside a document tree 
</I>&gt;<i> is always illegal, even if a branch of the document can be isolated 
</I>&gt;<i> where the id is unique, unless such branch is removed from the 
</I>&gt;<i> document).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This specification requires the _id_ attribute value to be unique in a 
</I>&gt;<i> subtree of the former type, thus a subtree of the latter type (e.g. a 
</I>&gt;<i> document fragment manipulated by a script) to be inserted into an HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> document must fulfil such requirement, as well as any other requirements 
</I>&gt;<i> defined in this specification for conformance purpose. Any API dealing 
</I>&gt;<i> with ID properties in any type of subtree must consider the _id_ 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute value of an HTMLElement as the element's default ID property; 
</I>&gt;<i> however, this specification doesn't preclude an element having multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> IDs, if other, API-specific mechanisms can set an element's ID in a way 
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't conflict with the id attribute&quot; - then the rest.
</I>
I've instead invented the term &quot;home subtree&quot; and used that.


&gt;<i> One rational for the above is that, formally, a subtree disconnected 
</I>&gt;<i> from any actual HTML document might be out of scope for current 
</I>&gt;<i> specification, which defines conformance rules for HTML documents and 
</I>&gt;<i> related contexts (such as a script context or a browsing context, both 
</I>&gt;<i> applying to a 'connected' subtree, as far as I've understood), while a 
</I>&gt;<i> subtree which is disconnected from a specific HTML document, but is 
</I>&gt;<i> contained into another one (thus coinciding with the containing document 
</I>&gt;<i> tree) is yet covered by the constraint for whole documents.
</I>
Subtrees disconnected from a document would be those held by scripts 
during manipulation of content fragments. Those are in scope.


&gt;<i> Another rational is that current specification, while relying on at 
</I>&gt;<i> least one method affected by IDs uniqueness in a document tree (that is, 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM Core Document.getElementById), does not provide, nor refers to, any 
</I>&gt;<i> API which might be directly affected by the uniqueness of an id 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute value in a disconnected subtree, thus such an API may be 
</I>&gt;<i> indirectly related to id values uniqueness if ID properties are relevant 
</I>&gt;<i> for its facilities, but the subtree itself cannot be constrained by 
</I>&gt;<i> conformance rules before its insertion into an actual HTML document.
</I>
I don't follow.


&gt;<i> A further rational is that a disconnected subtree might contain Node 
</I>&gt;<i> instances not implementing the HTMLElement interface, such as a 
</I>&gt;<i> DocumentFragment node, but also MathML/SVG elements, which might be 
</I>&gt;<i> embedded content elements coming from an HTML document tree, but also 
</I>&gt;<i> from a document of a different kind where the embedded content was 
</I>&gt;<i> represented by HTML elements, thus, without a sure knowledge on the 
</I>&gt;<i> subtree origin, applying an HTML-specific conformance rule might not be 
</I>&gt;<i> a correct choice, until the subtree is to be inserted into an HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> document.
</I>
We want unique IDs regardless of what other vocabularies are involved. The 
arguments for wanting unique IDness are language agnostic.


&gt;<i> For the question related to space characters inside an id value, I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;An ID property is not expected to contain space characters, so the

</I>&gt;<i> tolerated for the purpose of conformance, in order to avoid applying 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions to an otherwise legal fragment identifier value not being 
</I>&gt;<i> part of a _URL_.&quot;
</I>
I don't follow. Why would we allow spaces for URL matching? Surely it's 
fine to just say that fragment identifiers with spaces in them never match 
any legal HTML5 ID? (That's what HTML4 did.)

You don't need an ID map for CSS. CSS works the other way around, starting

I'd have said the opposite, actually -- when I read a ship name, I insert 
a short pause before the name of the ship and speak it with more stress 
(&quot;They boarded the _intrepid_&quot;) whereas if I'm reading a book with 
italicised dream sequences, I don't make any changes to my speech 
patterns. Either way, it is media-independent, because UAs of non-visual 
media are allowed to style these elements, they are no longer tied to 
visual media only.

I agree that conventions differ between media, but if the author wants to 
tweak the settings for each media, CSS and class values already exist to 
take care of this. At least now there is a suitable element to do this 
with; before &lt;i&gt; would have made sense for visual media, but restyling it 
for other media would have been dubious by definition.

Ah, this may indeed be the source of confusion. I was using &quot;important&quot;

</I>
I disagree with your assessment that only the product name is suitable for 
&lt;b&gt; in an advertisment.

Search for &quot;paint&quot; on Google. Notice that the advertisements highlight the 
keyword &quot;paint&quot; in the ads, even when this is not part of the ad. (This 
would be a good use of &lt;mark&gt;, rather than &lt;b&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;.)

I think balancing what authors are likely to do (e.g. they wouldn't 
reliably use fine grained semantic labels) vs what is likely to be usable 
by user agents (a few different kinds of renderings) is the balance we 
have to strike. There's no point solving problems if the solutions aren't 
going to be used (thus there's no point providing formal ways of marking 
up ship names vs irony vs dream sequences), and there's no point solving 
solutions if the solutions aren't good enough to work (e.g. just having a 
&lt;font&gt; element with no regard to other media).

As far as I can tell, the current spec strikes a good balance here.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Expressing semantics through presentation only is done in print 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; because of the limitations in the printing system. If the print was

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right, and we can get that with &lt;b&gt;. No need for a new element.
</I>&gt;<i>

I have no idea what this means, I'm sorry.


&gt;<i> The part I was considering more valuable was what I called (with a 
</I>&gt;<i> temporary name) a 'mousebehavior' describing linear movements of a 
</I>&gt;<i> pointing device: actions might be as easy as a succession of movements 
</I>&gt;<i> in different directions (right, left, up and down), detected as 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates difference between a 'start' and an 'end' point (detecting 
</I>&gt;<i> one direction at a time); such might be helpful, I guess, as an aid for 
</I>&gt;<i> certain disabilities, in conjunction with a pointing device capable to 
</I>&gt;<i> 'rectify' jugged movements, picking the start point as a mean value in a 
</I>&gt;<i> certain range (the same way a mouse driver considers a 'mouse up' as 
</I>&gt;<i> determining a 'click' if a 'mouse down' happened in a short range of 
</I>&gt;<i> pixels), and the end point as the mean value in a range where the user 
</I>&gt;<i> rests for a certain interval before moving again.
</I>
I really don't understand what you are saying here. What is the problem 
you wish to solve?
