</I>
The spec made me double-take when I read it (since it fairly clearly
separates range from codepoints). Also, I messed up the copypaste while
quoting, so the text I cited is not actually what's there, it's:

&gt;<i> in the ranges U+0001 to U+0008,  U+000B,  U+000E to U+001F,  U+007F  to U+009F, U+D800 to U+DFFF, U+FDD0 to U+FDDF, and characters U+FFFE...
</I>
It seems fairly clear to me that U+000B should moved to the list of
characters (at the cost of the nice ordering) or we should collapse
ranges/characters into one &quot;range&quot;.

The spec is pretty unambiguous about this:

&gt;<i> The next input character is the first character in the input stream that has not yet been consumed. Initially, the next input character is the first character in the input.
</I>
and, at the beginning of the section:

&gt;<i> Consume the next input character:
</I>
So, the spec is wrong.

&gt;<i> In practice I think having the text be clear (&quot;PUBLIC&quot;) is less confusing 
</I>&gt;<i> than having it be pedantic (&quot;P&quot; and &quot;UBLIC&quot; or &quot;this and the next five&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> some such). It's not like people are going to assume the spec is allowing 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;XPUBLIC&quot; or &quot;*PUBLIC&quot; and so forth, right?
</I>
I understand this consideration, and there's several ways we could go
about doing this. I think the easiest would be to un-consume a
character, and then perform the checks, and then reconsume the character.

As for people making this mistake... well, you're looking at one. :-)

Cheers,
Edward
