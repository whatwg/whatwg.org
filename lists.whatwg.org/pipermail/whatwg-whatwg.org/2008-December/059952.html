I think for contentEditable it's definitely not something we want to 
support natively; I've no idea how that would even work. I'd recommend 
doing it in CSS, using generated content based on the title=&quot;&quot; attribute 
or some such.

For &lt;textarea&gt;, a placeholder value seems odd. Do you have examples of 
people doing that?

I understand your position, but it seems that the industry has moved 
towards this as a pretty standard feature of user interfaces now, for 
better or worse.
