<PRE>Hi Giovanni,

I haven't read your entire comment, but with your point eight will  
break backwards compatibility. As far as I know is HTML5 supposed to  
combine old and new. The problem with interfaces is that you can not  
simply change them. That's just a fact we have to deal with.

&gt;<i> Please Note: all the following is my personal humble opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I discovered lately, the main problem of HTML5 is its design  
</I>&gt;<i> oriented to keep features that are distributed across browsers, that  
</I>&gt;<i> work or that are simple way to solve big problem. Actually, they are  
</I>&gt;<i> a bunch of different features somehow not integrated to the others.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, programmer (please note, I use the word programmer, not  
</I>&gt;<i> author or web designer) developing *new* application may more like a  
</I>&gt;<i> more structured and logical organization, like XHTML modularization  
</I>&gt;<i> is.
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 features, summed in big groups, are (in spec order):
</I>&gt;<i> 1) common syntax for the most used datatypes.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) additional DOM interfaces, which include HTMLElement -  
</I>&gt;<i> HTMLCollection - HTMLFormsControlCollection - HTMLOptionsCollection  
</I>&gt;<i> - DOMTokenList - DOMStringMap
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Elements and Content Models
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Element types: metadata - structure - sectioning - grouping -  
</I>&gt;<i> text - editing - embedding - table - forms - interactive - scripting  
</I>&gt;<i> elements
</I>&gt;<i> 5) User agent requirements
</I>&gt;<i> 6) User Interaction
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Communication
</I>&gt;<i> 8) HTML Syntax
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of these features can be achieved without any of HTML5, for  
</I>&gt;<i> example
</I>&gt;<i> 1) use XMLSchema datatypes
</I>&gt;<i> 2) you don't need HTMLElement: markup insertion, attributes querying  
</I>&gt;<i> can be done using DOM3Core (that in latest browser are even more  
</I>&gt;<i> performant as no parser is involved), events are far better handled  
</I>&gt;<i> by DOM3Events, styling is included by CSSOM
</I>&gt;<i> you don't need collection either: just use appropriate DOMNodeLists,  
</I>&gt;<i> while for DOMStringMap you may use binding specific features (all  
</I>&gt;<i> Object are hash maps in ECMAScript3): it works this way even in HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> 3) use XHTML2, which is extensible because modularized
</I>&gt;<i> 4) metadata is better handled by XHTML2 Meta Attributes module,  
</I>&gt;<i> which fully integrates the RDF module in any elements;
</I>&gt;<i> structure, sectioning, grouping are the same;
</I>&gt;<i> text is very similar: you don't have time, but you can have &lt;span  
</I>&gt;<i> datatype=&quot;xsd:date&quot; content=&quot;2008-12-21&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/span&gt; as in HTML5  
</I>&gt;<i> you have &lt;time value=&quot;2008-12-21&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/time&gt;; for progress and  
</I>&gt;<i> meter semantic you can use role attribute (for styling you always  
</I>&gt;<i> use CSS); editing is the same, but you have an attribute instead of  
</I>&gt;<i> an element, so you don't have the issue that ins and del can contain  
</I>&gt;<i> everything, even a whole document (not including &lt;html&gt;);
</I>&gt;<i> embedding is much more powerful as any element can be replaced by  
</I>&gt;<i> embedded content;
</I>&gt;<i> tables are the same (you don't have tables API; but you can still  
</I>&gt;<i> use DOM3Core);
</I>&gt;<i> XForms are actually more powerful than WebForms2, since you divide  
</I>&gt;<i> presentation from data from action (that is implemented  
</I>&gt;<i> declaratively);
</I>&gt;<i> interactive elements are not needed at all: details is better  
</I>&gt;<i> implemented as it is now (ECMAScript3 + CSS3), datagrid is just a  
</I>&gt;<i> way to put data in a tree model: use plain XML for that; command and  
</I>&gt;<i> a in XHTML2 implemented in any element using href attribute; menu is  
</I>&gt;<i> mostly an ul with some style;
</I>&gt;<i> scripting uses XMLEvents and handler: it looks the same, but it is  
</I>&gt;<i> different as it is more event oriented (scripts are not executed by  
</I>&gt;<i> default, they're executed when some event fires)
</I>&gt;<i> 8) HTML syntax: as I said before, use XML for that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are instead features that are indeed very useful to develop a  
</I>&gt;<i> web application, but are not achievable using other means that HTML5:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) some way to interact with object (please note: object, not embed:  
</I>&gt;<i> object is for plugins, embed for content) : actually this can be  
</I>&gt;<i> done using something like cross document messaging, assuming that  
</I>&gt;<i> object creates a new browsing context (it already does if the target  
</I>&gt;<i> is text/html or application/xhtml+xml), but we need a specification  
</I>&gt;<i> for message syntax
</I>&gt;<i> 2) the binding specific global scope (that is, what object are  
</I>&gt;<i> available in all scopes, if binding supports this); this is normally  
</I>&gt;<i> the window object, but scripts use certain features only on their  
</I>&gt;<i> own browsing context, so that may be moved from that to global  
</I>&gt;<i> scope, removing the whole window object from scope (for current  
</I>&gt;<i> javascript you can write window.window.window.window.window... and  
</I>&gt;<i> get the same as nothing)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) the Window object (which includes window name, window location,  
</I>&gt;<i> cross document messaging, dialog windows)
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Protocol and Content Handlers
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Session and Local storage
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Database storage
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Drag and Drop
</I>&gt;<i> 8) WebSockets
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am asking now is so to &quot;modularize HTML&quot;. copy those features  
</I>&gt;<i> into separate, interoperable modules, removing legacy features (like  
</I>&gt;<i> window.on-whatever event listener)
</I>&gt;<i> A copy of those will remain in HTML5, because browser implement them  
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment, and the HTML5 goal is that all browser implement the  
</I>&gt;<i> same things in the same ways
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, some web developers in the future will think that a  
</I>&gt;<i> modularized and less redudant API is more usable, like I personally  
</I>&gt;<i> do, and switch to that, without mixing with HTML5: actually, I guess  
</I>&gt;<i> what a Database API does inside HTML.
</I>&gt;<i>
