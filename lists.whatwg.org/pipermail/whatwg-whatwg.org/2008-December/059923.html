Yeah, it's really annoying. :-)


&gt;<i> I would support an explicit keepaspectratio attribute, which turns the

</I>&gt;<i> or an explicit video element attribute - I am not fussed.
</I>
I think that this belongs in CSS, for the reason Nils gave:

</I>&gt;<i> This raises a few questions:

We already do.


&gt;<i> * How often is the widht/height metadata in videos encoded with wrong values?
</I>
Relatively often, IMHO, that's why I wanted pixelratio=&quot;&quot;. But we've 
established that this is not something we're addressing in v1.


&gt;<i> * Do we want to force all video players to decode a few frames and get
</I>&gt;<i> the correct width/height values to then adapt to the viewport?
</I>
We already force them to decode the end of the stream to get the right 
duration, having them decode one frame so that they can render that frame 
seems reasonable enough.


&gt;<i> * Do we have use cases for overriding correct aspect ratio displays by 
</I>&gt;<i> users? (and should that then go into a CSS control?)
</I>
There are always use cases for presentational effects, and those indeed 
belong in CSS.


&gt;<i> I would much prefer the default video display to get it right inside a 
</I>&gt;<i> viewport, than to risk relying on users to get the aspect ratio right.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> Also, the viewport approach makes it easier to have a consistently sized 
</I>&gt;<i> video player rather than adapting the video player to the video's actual 
</I>&gt;<i> size and thus potentially constantly switching between 4:3 and 16:9.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> So (contrary to what I wrote just before), I think the attribute should 
</I>&gt;<i> not be a &quot;keepaspectratio&quot; attribute but rather something like 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fillviewport&quot; and it should probably be a CSS attribute.
</I>
Agreed.

</I>
Right, that's why we dropped pixelratio=&quot;&quot;. :-)


&gt;<i> But in any event, if a CSS solution is in fact possible that would be

</I>
Well, CSS transforms don't officially exist yet, but you could use a 
scale() or scaleX() transform:
