The spec merely describes what the implementations and earlier DOM specs

There have been convincing arguments made along these lines, yes. I'm not 
sure I would say that I think it's a good idea personally...


&gt;<i> and that you also obviously consider it useful for certain rel values to

</I>
So far in ten years, we've only had one rel value that needed a new 
attribute. I think at that rate, we can rely on such extensions going 
through the normal spec extension mechanism rather than needing an 
expedited extension mechanism (which is what we have for rel values).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/gif; width=24, height=24&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; This doesn't really work because we would need to add parameters 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to types we might not yet know. It also results in potentially 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; complicated parsing rules, which I don't think people would get 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; right. (See the comments I made for media queries.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Presumably this would be defined (if at all) for everything under 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;image/&quot;, just as &quot;charset&quot; is defined for everything under &quot;text/&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (In theory, at least.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Getting the relevant RFCs changed would likely be non-trivial. (Though 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we should probably look into it, actually, to fix text/*.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that (for now, at least) these type attributes would be of little

</I>
We're not changing MathML and SVG either. As you say, it would be a 
layering violation.

I think it would make sense for an authoring guide to mention this, but I

This isn't a huge deal really.

The idea is that this icon _will_ indeed be used as the favicon. Icons are 
getting bigger (though not 300KB bigger yet, surely). Screens are becoming
higher resolution displays. 16x16 won't really cut it any more.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would the WHAT-WG be interested in looking at standardising this?
</I>
It's not clear to me that this idea would work in practice. Why would 
authors not get the fingerprint wrong more often than attacks being 
caught? This is especially serious since the feature's failure mode 
(browser A incorrectly says there's a problem, browser B downloads the 
file fine and the file appears to work fine) looks the same as a 
successful trojaning (browser A accurately says there's a problem, browser 
B downloads the file fine and the file appears to work fine, though with 
trojan code running unbeknownst to the user).

Also, I don't really understand the attack scenario it is protecting 
against. If the idea is that a file on site A will include a fingerprint 
that protects against a file on site B being replaced with a trojan, this 
assumes that either the person uploading the file will be tricked into 
using a different file, or they will intentionally upload another file, or 
site B will be attacked and a new file put in its place.

However, all three of these scenarios seem like they are still vulnerable. 
In the first case, surely the person uploading the file and updating the 
fingerprint would just accidentally use the fingerprint of the trojan 
file; in the second case, they would presumably do it on purpose; and in 
the third case, why wouldn't the attacker just attack the site with the 
fingerprint instead? Nothing in the attack scenario would lead us to 
assume that the site with the fingerprint is less vulnerable.

If you disagree with this analysis, I would recommend demonstrating this 
feature's viability by implementing it (using a vendor prefix if you use a 
new attribute, e.g. -moz-fingerprint=&quot;...&quot;).

The failure more isn't that bad (the link just doesn't show), so I don't

It would also mean any element could be in the :link/:visited dynamic 
update list, it would mean that even elements like &lt;frameset&gt; and &lt;tr&gt; 
could be links, it would mean putting all the various accesors on all 
elements (like .hash, .search). I'm not really sure how we'd deal with 
clashes of property and attribute names.

I'm sure it can be done, technically; but the cost would be high.

Having said that if all the browser vendors are ok with it, then it's 
certainly something I'd be open to speccing out -- I think what would be 
most helpful here is an experimental implementation showing it can be 
done, so that we can get a better idea of what problems we'd run into.

The problem with this is that it would be very confusing if the button was 
in a form.

If the goal is to make a link look like a button, this seems to be a 
presentational concern. I would recommend solving this issue from CSS. In 
particular, the 'appearance' property can make any element into a 
button-like object.

Having said that, in HTML5 you can now do:

   &lt;form&gt;
    ...
    &lt;button action=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/&quot;">http://www.w3.org/&quot;</A>&gt;W3C&lt;/button&gt;
    ...
   &lt;/form&gt;

...to create a button that acts like a link. Indeed even in HTML4 you can 
today do:

   &lt;form action=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/&quot;">http://www.w3.org/&quot;</A>&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;W3C&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;

...to get the effect you describe.

I've made them more consistent. I was also going to change the spec to

new values.
