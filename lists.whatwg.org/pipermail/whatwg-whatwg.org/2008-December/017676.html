This only works if the form data is in the format you need it in. Say that 
you have a calendar-like feature -- if the server uses

   .../year/month/day/...

...as the URL form, you can't just convert an &lt;input type=date&gt; value into 
that URL, so you still have to have script or server-side redirection or 
some logic in the templating language -- and short of making it turing 
complete, the templating language won't ever be a complete solution.

As I have not always been paid to participate in the standards process, I 
can say from personal experience that it is quite possible to spend free 
time doing this if one wants to. It's not that much work.


&gt;<i> &gt; Why isn't the current form submission mechanism, with a redirect on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the server-side, not acceptable?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two main reasons:

</I>&gt;<i> 1.) Use cases where the person writing the form is not technically in 
</I>&gt;<i> control of the server and where Javascript is unavailable and the

</I>
What are the places that allow you to write forms but don't allow you to 
write scripts on either the client or the server?


&gt;<i> 2.) Performance best practices frown on it: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#redirects">http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#redirects</A> 
</I>
Sre, that's what the scripts are for -- making it faster if possible.


&gt;<i> I keep saying &quot;where Javascript is unavailable and the percentage of 
</I>&gt;<i> places where these use-cases exist are growing rapidly because of social 
</I>&gt;<i> media and content management systems&quot; but you are not acknowledging. Are 
</I>&gt;<i> you implicitly discrediting that as a concern, or have you missed those 
</I>&gt;<i> comments of mine?
</I>
I don't see evidence that there are places that let you do forms and 
service interaction but don't let you have scripts or server-side scripts. 
Indeed, at this point writing server-side script is easy and cheap, with 
services like Dreamhost, Google App Engine, etc.


&gt;<i> &gt; Because it adds significant complexity to the browser platform, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without really adding new functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Significant? Srsly?  Seems to me we are talking about simply a URI 
</I>&gt;<i> Template variable substitution.  Since it is *easy* to do in Javascript 
</I>&gt;<i> how can it be adding &quot;significant complexity&quot; to the browser platform?  
</I>&gt;<i> It seems your two points are in direct contradiction; how are they not?
</I>
A script can implement a hard-coded conversion, it doesn't have to 
implement templating. Templates themselves are a non-trivial feature in 
terms of complexity.


&gt;<i> &gt; And are you really expecting search engines to fill in forms that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would use templates?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> YES!!  Why would they not, if they could?
</I>
How would they know what to say?


&gt;<i> &gt; Something that can't be done without the feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the use-case is no access to the server and only Javascript then 
</I>&gt;<i> this use-case can't be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the members of the web team say NO REDIRECTs on performance 
</I>&gt;<i> grounds, it can't be done.
</I>
You don't have to do redirects, just support two URIs, one for the 
permalinks (nice URIs) one for form submissions (parsing query data).


&gt;<i> &gt; Something that allows authors to write applications that make users 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say &quot;wow!&quot;, which they can't do today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> URI Templates in forms would make core devs on content management 
</I>&gt;<i> systems and frameworks go WOW once they realized what it can empower.  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm soliciting such feedback on Twitter: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twitter.com/mikeschinkel/status/985784895">http://twitter.com/mikeschinkel/status/985784895</A>
</I>
The response was not overwhelming.


&gt;<i> &gt; What if the user types something that isn't supported by weather.com, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like the string &quot;x&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP handles that elegantly; 404.
</I>
With all due respect, that is hardly elegant.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, why can't you just do:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced&quot;">http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced&quot;</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;where&quot;/&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Check Weather!&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So obvious it hurts: Because I don't current control Weather's server 
</I>&gt;<i> and they have no <A HREF="http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced">http://www.weather.com/search/enhanced</A> URL.
</I>
Yes they do. Did you try it? It works just like yours would, except with 
better error-handling.


&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really follow what you're saying here. I see no practical 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference between URI templates and normal forms in terms of Google 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crawling the results.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Normal forms?&quot;  Google is not going to try to parse out javascript code 
</I>&gt;<i> that is custom to a website nor &quot;user added&quot; form attributes.
</I>
No, but it can use unscripted forms today the same as it could use 
templated forms. 


&gt;<i> Also, adding a template attribute to a form element w/o it being in spec 
</I>&gt;<i> causes it to fail validation; I thought validation was a holy grail but 
</I>&gt;<i> you are instead suggesting we write HTML that doesn't validate?  Why 
</I>&gt;<i> only argue for validation when it is convenient?
</I>
Validation is a tool, not a holy grail.

(If you wanted to use a script, you could use data-template=&quot;&quot; to store 
the template. That would validate.)


&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think anyone is denying that it is useful in certain cases. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question is whether it will be used widely enough to make it worth 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's more important; critical in 5% of cases or nice-to-have in 50% of 
</I>&gt;<i> cases?
</I>
I don't understand the relevance of the question.

It seems like you are arguing here that HTTP URIs with query parameters 
aren't RESTful, which seems like an odd position.
