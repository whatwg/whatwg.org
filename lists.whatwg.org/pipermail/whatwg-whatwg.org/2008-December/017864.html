I agree that MathML is how you should mark up this kind of thing. However, 
&lt;var&gt; still has other uses, e.g. the spec uses it to good effect in a 
number of places. It is not just for mathematics. There is an example in 
the &lt;var&gt; element's section to this effect.

Right, in a mathematics context, e.g. in an expression, if one needs to 
mark up anything beyond just what the variables are, then one should use 
MathML. For anything simpler, or for non-mathematical contexts, &lt;var&gt; is 
still useful.

I disagree with this, because it still makes sense to use &lt;var&gt; for 
variables even in simple mathematical contexts (e.g. the spec does so in 
several places without needing to drop down to MathML).

However, I agree that we should mention MathML there, so I have done so.

This is an area that has had some research done:

   <A HREF="http://24ways.org/2006/marking-up-a-tag-cloud">http://24ways.org/2006/marking-up-a-tag-cloud</A>
   <A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/tagcloud-brainstorming">http://microformats.org/wiki/tagcloud-brainstorming</A>

I don't really see a compelling answer yet, and frankly tag clouds as a 
whole aren't really so important that we need dedicated markup. So I 
haven't put anything in the spec about it yet.

Generally I would recommend something like the 24ways proposal:

   &lt;ol class=&quot;tag-cloud&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- alphabetical --&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;tag-cloud-4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4 times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/t/bar&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;tag-cloud-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2 times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/t/baz&quot;&gt;baz&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;tag-cloud-5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;5 times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/t/foo&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;

...with:

   @media screen, print, handheld, tv { 
     /* should be ignored by speech browsers */
     .tag-cloud &gt; li &gt; span { display: none; }
     .tag-cloud &gt; li { display: inline; }
     .tag-cloud-1 { font-size: 0.7em; }
     .tag-cloud-2 { font-size: 0.9em; }
     .tag-cloud-3 { font-size: 1.1em; }
     .tag-cloud-4 { font-size: 1.3em; }
     .tag-cloud-5 { font-size: 1.5em; }
   }

Or, alternatively:

   &lt;ol class=&quot;tag-cloud&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- alphabetical --&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;4 times&quot; href=&quot;/t/bar&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;2 times&quot; href=&quot;/t/baz&quot;&gt;baz&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;5 times&quot; href=&quot;/t/foo&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;

...with:

   @media screen, print, handheld, tv { 
     /* should be ignored by speech browsers */
     .tag-cloud &gt; li { display: inline; }
     .tag-cloud [title^=&quot;1 &quot;] { font-size: 0.7em; }
     .tag-cloud [title^=&quot;2 &quot;] { font-size: 0.9em; }
     .tag-cloud [title^=&quot;3 &quot;] { font-size: 1.1em; }
     .tag-cloud [title^=&quot;4 &quot;] { font-size: 1.3em; }
     .tag-cloud [title^=&quot;5 &quot;] { font-size: 1.5em; }
   }

Or some combination thereof.

(The CSS would actually need to be more hacky until such time as screen 
readers grow up to be real speech browsers instead of following the screen 
media, but that's another problem.)

If people think all this is worth mentioning in the spec, I can add it. 
Let me know.

We have all of those too, they're in MathML, which is now part of the

&gt;<i> And if code gets this attention why not language? (&lt;verb&gt;, &lt;noun&gt; etc.

Well, it's not clear that there is much need for marking up verbs and 
nouns, etc. People discussing grammar are a niche case that is handled by 
&lt;span&gt; pretty well.

The former is simpler for authors, and, as an added bonus, already works 
today. Those are the major differences.

Also, why stop at &lt;reference class=&quot;abbreviation&quot;&gt;? Why not go one step 
further? For example, we could have:

   &lt;phrasing class=&quot;reference&quot; subclass=&quot;abbreviation&quot;&gt;...

...or even:

   &lt;text class=&quot;phrasing&quot; subclass=&quot;reference&quot; subsubclass=&quot;abbreviation&quot;&gt;...

It isn't clear to me where we should stop. To determine where we should 
stop, we need a clear description of the problem we are trying to address; 
I don't really understand the problem here.

Again, I don't understand _why_ we would do this. What problem would this

&gt;<i> I think following HTML4's and XHTML1's approach and having
</I>&gt;<i> Transitional and Strict flavors wouldn't be a bad idea
</I>
What problem does it solve? It was originally intended to help people 
transition from HTML3.2 to HTML4 Strict, but it ended up not being 
successful at this.


&gt;<i> Initially, HTML was entirely structural: no presentation, and no 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics. Just paragraphs, headings, anchors, and few other things.
</I>
This isn't actually the case:

   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html">http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html</A>

Notice &lt;hp1&gt;. :-) And &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; were introduced at the same time as 
&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;, with HTML2.


&gt;<i> With HTML3.2, there was an atempt to make HTML presentational, and it
</I>&gt;<i> soundly failed.
</I>
I don't know if I'd say that it &quot;failed&quot;. It was a disaster, for sure, but 
mostly because of its success, not its failure.


&gt;<i> It was aknowledged as a mistake, and HTML4 (plus CSS) put a good deal of 
</I>&gt;<i> work on fixing it: presentational stuff went out (more preciselly, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;deprecated&quot;), and presentation was delegated to a separate language 
</I>&gt;<i> (CSS). HTML only left @class for hooking to external information, and 
</I>&gt;<i> @style for when embedding was more appropriate.
</I>
That's not quite right (e.g. HTML4 has &lt;table border&gt; even in strict), but 
mostly, yes. HTML5 continues in this direction, going even further (e.g. 
we don't have the presentational attributes on tables, and &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are 
defined in logical terms, not only based on visual presentation).


&gt;<i> Then, to make sure noone was left out, a Strict flavor of the language 
</I>&gt;<i> was published, keeping it &quot;pure&quot;, and a Transitional one, keeping all 
</I>&gt;<i> the deprecated stuff on it to ease transition, and to enable 
</I>&gt;<i> document-level backwards compatibility. I hope we all agree this was a 
</I>&gt;<i> good solution and that it worked; but if somebody doesn't, please let me 
</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>
I'm not sure exactly how you define &quot;worked&quot; here. Most pages don't use 
HTML4 Strict, they use HTML4 Transitional or have no DOCTYPE at all. 
Presentational idioms are very widely used on the Web.


&gt;<i> So, if it worked, why not reuse that approach? Why do we need to go 
</I>&gt;<i> through the same mistakes again?
</I>
We are in fact using an even more aggressive form of the approach you 
describe.


&gt;<i> Now, Pentasis initial posts were showing up a fact: sematic markup 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't do enough to properly describe the semantics of webpages.
</I>
It's not clear to me that this has been convincingly shown.


&gt;<i> Can't we simply apply an equivalent solution to the one we used for an 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent problem ten years ago?
</I>
It's not clear to me that the problems are equivalent, since I don't 
understand the current problem.


&gt;<i> &lt;nav&gt; is the only facility in the spec right now to describe 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;navigation&quot; semantics; but it also implies a &quot;section&quot; structure: hence 
</I>&gt;<i> there is no means to express &quot;navigation&quot; semantics for something that 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't structurally a &quot;section&quot; (for example, headings of the recent 
</I>&gt;<i> changes to a site in the site's main page, linked to the relevant 
</I>&gt;<i> sections, are quite &quot;navigation&quot; stuff, but they are definitely not 
</I>&gt;<i> sections).
</I>
Well, all links are &quot;navigation&quot;, that's shown by the &lt;a&gt; element. The 
&lt;nav&gt; element is specifically for navigation within a set of pages. I 
don't see this as a big problem (or really, a problem at all).


&gt;<i> Similarly, there is no way to mark something as &quot;tangentially related&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> without making it a &quot;section&quot; (with the &lt;aside&gt; element).
</I>
So?


&gt;<i> And, for example, what about something that's both &quot;navigation&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tangentially related&quot; (regardless of wether it is a section or not)? 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, a list of &quot;see also&quot; stuff on a documentation page: you 
</I>&gt;<i> would be forced to markup it as &lt;&lt;a &quot;navigation&quot; section inside an 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;aside&quot; section&gt;&gt; or as &lt;&lt;an &quot;aside&quot; section inside a &quot;navigation&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> section&gt;&gt;: none of both reflects the real structure of the page; but 
</I>&gt;<i> they are the only ways to represent both semantics.
</I>
Actually, I wouldn't use either. &quot;See also: foo, bar&quot; is not necessarily 
an aside and not necessarily site navigation in the sense of &lt;nav&gt;, it can 
be part of the main body text.

One way to think of &lt;nav&gt; is &quot;would you want an accessibility tool to skip 
these links by default?&quot;. One way to think of &lt;aside&gt; is &quot;would you want 
this to be moved to a sidebar?&quot;.


&gt;<i> Now, to something more specific, we'd need:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Some (external to HTML) way to describe semantics. (And no, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think RDF, on its current form, is a solution for this; but maybe the

</I>&gt;<i> semantics what CSS is to presentation. And we don't really need to care

</I>&gt;<i> semantics (at least, not beyond displaying @title values and for default 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering, and rendering can be dealt with through CSS anyway).
</I>
Isn't the HTML5 spec itself this?


&gt;<i> 2) A way to hook these external semantics to arbitrary elements of a 
</I>&gt;<i> page: we already got @class for this :D
</I>
This seems like a really bad idea -- why would we want to have elements

&gt;<i> 3) A way to add inline semantics when needed. I guess a &quot;semantics&quot;

</I>
We already have that, e.g. &lt;em&gt; is an inline way of saying &quot;emphasis&quot;. 
Moving it to an attribute is just syntactic juggling.

Consider a speech browser. Does it makes sense to convey small print in a

faster for the small print.) Does it make sense to represent a span of 
text stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying

Media independence is what we're going for here. &lt;font&gt;, for example,

HTML is ultimately meant for human consumption, not machine consumption.

This doesn't scale -- there are an unbounded set of features that aren't

That would only work if authors reliably marked up author names vs brand

headers vs paragraphs, or tables headers vs table cells, I really don't 
see any reason to be optimistic about authors' abilities to mark brand

Also, Google already handles the case you mention. Search for &quot;Siemens&quot;. 
Then search for &quot;George Siemens&quot; or &quot;Fred Siemens&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> me that &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are context-free just in their typographic semantics (the

</I>&gt;<i> understanding or to recall its theme, usually rendered with bold text and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly requiring a voice inflection different from normal prose but not so
</I>&gt;<i> incisive as very important content' (as an article abstract or some keywords
</I>&gt;<i> could be classified), and if &lt;em&gt; expresses 'strong emphasis', &lt;i&gt; could
</I>&gt;<i> express 'lesser emphasis than &lt;em&gt; text' or 'some change in the message

</I>&gt;<i> voice inflection' (as a foreign language word or a taxonomy name could
</I>&gt;<i> indicate).

Could I possibly encourage you to split your paragraphs into smaller 
paragraphs?


&gt;<i> In other words, I'm not concerning whether the actual semantics of &lt;b&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> and &lt;i&gt; is consistent with common uses of italicized and bold text, and 
</I>&gt;<i> with their conventional definitions (human-understandable, but perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> not machine-friendly), but whether that's well defined (context-free) 
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to a user agent capabilities to correctly interpret and 
</I>&gt;<i> present them. Visually that's painless, but non visually (non 
</I>&gt;<i> graphically) I'm quite feeling the need for a greater context-freedom 
</I>&gt;<i> (at least binding them to some more precise semantics, with respect to 
</I>&gt;<i> which to scale &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; semantics and make them more context-free).
</I>
I have to admit to having no idea what you are talking about here.

The key is that the way we have defined &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, and &lt;small&gt; is roughly 
in line with what authors do already anyway, as much as other tags are 
roughly in line with how they are used.

We will, for the actually obsolete elements.


&gt;<i> The thing I am concerned with is that if they are included like &quot;normal&quot;

What's wrong with &lt;b&gt; as defined now?



There were a number of other e-mails in these threads that I haven't 
replied to here because they didn't propose changes to the spec. If there 
are any e-mails I should reply to, or any topics I should focus on, please 
let me know.
