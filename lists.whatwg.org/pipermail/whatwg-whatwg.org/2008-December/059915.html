</I>&gt;<i> why should this be different for images and video?
</I>
Why should it be the same, other than consistency? I wouldn't make &lt;img&gt; 
stretch either if I was defining it today. Allowing stretching of images 
enabled a lot of problems, such as images at the wrong ratio, 
presentational use of images, etc.


&gt;<i> there are ways to center elements inside a &quot;playback area&quot;.
</I>
Why makes things more complicated than necessary?


&gt;<i> how would i stretch a video if its always displayed in the aspect ratio 
</I>&gt;<i> from the container, i.e. to have an animation where the video is a dot 
</I>&gt;<i> first, than gets stretched to a thin 5 x 480 element and than unfolds to 
</I>&gt;<i> its full dimensions 640x480.
</I>
Animations of that nature should be done either using SVG or CSS 
transforms, not at the HTML level.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Video content should be rendered inside the element's playback area

</I>&gt;<i> playback area that do not contain the video represent nothing.&quot;
</I>
That's what it said before we added pixelratio=&quot;&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; We definitely don't want to stretch the video. One of the important 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use cases if having a video playback area and then playing videos with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different aspect ratios in that playback area. It should all just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm having a hard time seeing how this is a use case for video and not 
</I>&gt;<i> for img.
</I>
I don't understand how it's a use case for &lt;img&gt; either.


&gt;<i> If one wants the intrinsic width/height to be used, then simply don't 
</I>&gt;<i> set width/height. Otherwise, just setting just one of width/height or 
</I>&gt;<i> using CSS max-width/max-height should do the trick.
</I>
The idea is that generally you don't want the intrinsic size to be used, 
you want a consistent size to be used, and you would set it from CSS.


&gt;<i> This is strange:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video src=&quot;circle.mpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- circle --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video src=&quot;circle.mpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- pillarbox --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;circle.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- circle --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;circle.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- oval --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be much more consistent if these elements behaved in 
</I>&gt;<i> the same way.
</I>
I don't think consistency here is an issue. Or if you like, consider it 
as being consistent with &lt;iframe&gt;:

   &lt;iframe src=&quot;circle.html&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- circle --&gt;
   &lt;iframe src=&quot;circle.html&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- pillarbox --&gt;


&gt;<i> As it stands, after the pixelratio was removed, there is no way to 
</I>&gt;<i> display a circle as an oval or vice versa, which means it is both 
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to fix an incorrect aspect ratio or to stretch the video for 
</I>&gt;<i> some other purpose.
</I>
Right; we established that the use cases for stretching the video were not 
convincing, that's why I removed pixelratio=&quot;&quot;.

True.

</I>&gt;<i> of the day, being consistent with &lt;img&gt; wouldn't be worth the potential

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the stretch attribute, we should have this functionally

</I>
I agree that something like stretch or pixelratio should probably be added 
in a future version, but since we just removed pixelratio=&quot;&quot; I don't think 
it is something we want to add now.

True.

</I>
There are inconsistencies all over the place already. This doesn't add a 
new one, since &lt;img&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt;, and &lt;video&gt; already act differently in so 
many ways.


&gt;<i> The use case for stretching moving images (&lt;video&gt;) is exactly the same 
</I>&gt;<i> as for stretching animations (&lt;img src=animation.gif&gt;) or static images 
</I>&gt;<i> (&lt;img src=static.jpg&gt;). While I think that fixing incorrect aspect ratio 
</I>&gt;<i> is the most probable use, consistency and generality is the real issue 
</I>&gt;<i> here. With an image of size 800x600 it's possible to display at any 
</I>&gt;<i> size, even those which don't match the aspect 4:3. With moving images 
</I>&gt;<i> (video) we can't influence it at all.
</I>
If consistency is the only use case, then I don't think that's convincing.


&gt;<i> The previous solution was the pixelratio attribute, but I have 2 other
</I>&gt;<i> possible solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video src=&quot;4x3.mpg&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; keepaspect&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The video would be pillarboxed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video src=&quot;4x3.mpg&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The video would be stretched and have incorrect aspect, just like
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;4x3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way it's easy to stretch or to keep aspect, whichever you want.
</I>
I fear that if we do this, authors will screw up the ratio a lot. The 
whole point of &lt;video&gt; is to not provide too many ways that authors can 
screw things up.


&gt;<i> Given the number of people who watch 4:3 video stretched to a 16:9 
</I>&gt;<i> display without even noticing/caring that the aspect ratio is wrong, I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think we can trust that the aspect ratio of all videos is always 
</I>&gt;<i> going to be correctly encoded and simple say that this should be fixed 
</I>&gt;<i> by reencoding the video -- that's not even an option if the source file 
</I>&gt;<i> is not available and reencoding is good for quality.
</I>
Making it easy for authors to screw it up more isn't a way to solve this. :-)

pixelratio=&quot;&quot; was an ok solution because it was unlikely to be used much, 
but height/width will be used all over the place if we allow it.

I agree that CSS (maybe taking something from SVG and making it more 
general) would be a good way to address this.
