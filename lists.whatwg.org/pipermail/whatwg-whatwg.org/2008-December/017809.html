I just realized an error in my thought that I would need to modify the
parsing algorithm; that would only be the case if I tried to integrate
filtering with the core processing. If it's a two-stage process, the
core processing merely has special rules for certain elements embedded
in it, but otherwise acts normally. Performance *is* an issue (getting
things to be standards compliant is relatively CPU/memory intensive),
but getting things to work is first.

</I>
HTML Purifier puts a high value on standards-compliance, and we've been
attacked on several occasions because of it. &quot;Standards suck.&quot; To this I
have to say, standards compliance has helped defend against a number of
XSS attacks--enforcing it lowers attack surface and makes behavior much
more well-defined. So I feel like it's a goal worth striving for, in and
of itself, especially since you can't enforce semantics with computers.

Cheers,
Edward
