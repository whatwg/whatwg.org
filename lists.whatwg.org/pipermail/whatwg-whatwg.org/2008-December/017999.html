Yes. The range is likely to differ based on the platform used -- today's 
32 bit systems will likely have different ranges than next decade's 128 
bit systems.


&gt;<i> Either way I would recommend making a decision on minimum and maximum

</I>
ECMAScript does define a range, and the limits of that range are exposed 
to scripts. Are there cases where there are non-script limits that would 
benefit from being exposed? Use cases would be helpful here.


&gt;<i> Also the spec interchanges the terms &quot;non-negative integer&quot;, &quot;positive 
</I>&gt;<i> integer&quot; and &quot;unsigned integer&quot;. I suggest defining one of these clearly 
</I>&gt;<i> and then using it everywhere.
</I>
&quot;non-negative integer&quot; is used to mean zero-or-more. I got rid of all 
cases of &quot;positive integers&quot; I could find. I changed the heading of the 
section on non-negative integers to say &quot;non-negative&quot; instead of 
&quot;unsigned&quot; but now the sections are inconsistently named, which may annoy 
me enough that I'll change it back at some point.


&gt;<i> This is a very minor point but is it necessary to say &quot;valid integer&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that there appears to be no defined min/max range when is 
</I>&gt;<i> something both an integer and at the same time invalid? Isn't an invalid 
</I>&gt;<i> integer a string?
</I>
A valid integer is a string also. I don't understand what you mean.


&gt;<i> Finally I wasn't aware Javascript made a distinction between signed and 
</I>&gt;<i> unsigned integers. Is the distinction really necessary? Can we just make 
</I>&gt;<i> everything signed integers and consistently call the full range 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;integer&quot; and the positive range &quot;integer greater than 0&quot;?
</I>
JavaScript doesn't make the distinction, but other languages do, and 
WebIDL defines behavior for unsigned integers that is different from 
signed integers.
