Well, as far as I get the various discussions in the WHATWG list, many 
of them are about one of the following:
- Making things easier
- Introducing features into HTML that are commonly solved by client-side 
(e.g. the extensions to the input element) or server-side scripting 
(e.g. solving the login/logout problem in HTML)
- Improving language consistency (e.g. the discussions about elements 
such as abbr, dfn, small, b etc.)

So I don't think that your arguments do not necessarily make my thoughts 
obsolete. Anyway I see the facts that WF2 is declared feature complete, 
that backwards compatibility has a very high priority, and that making 
form controls more consistent may not be crucial for WF2.

So let me, as a conclusion, repeat two points out of the suggestions I 
made earlier, which I think would be quite helpful, and which do not 
cause backwards compatibility problems, as they degrade to the default 
behaviour of the elements in older UAs. After that I will not insist in 
this topic anymore... :-)

1. Introduce a type attribute to the select element, which can change 
the output into a list of radio buttons (in normal mode) resp. 
checkboxes (in multiple mode).

2. Introduce a multiline attribute to input type=&quot;text&quot;, possibly 
supplemented by a rows attribute.
