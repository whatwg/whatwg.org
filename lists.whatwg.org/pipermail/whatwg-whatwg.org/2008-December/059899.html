For non-infinite streams, the duration is defined to be known. That is, 
the user agent is required to find the duration and set the &quot;duration&quot; 
attribute accordingly.

</I>
One is not allowed to avoid this per spec today, short of using a codec 
that doesn't have this problem.


&gt;<i> While getting the absolute duration is often a problem retrieving the 
</I>&gt;<i> length of the media file is is no problem. I propose seeking with 
</I>&gt;<i> relative positions, e.g. values between zero and one. This way the

</I>&gt;<i> known) or to just jump into to a position of the bytestream (if the 
</I>&gt;<i> length in bytes is known).
</I>
You can jump to a position that's a fraction of the whole clip by setting 
'currentTime' to a fractional multiple of 'duration'.


&gt;<i>  - make currentTime readonly, still have it report playback position in 
</I>&gt;<i> absolute time. This information should be available in all media formats 
</I>&gt;<i> due to timestamps in the stream.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - introduce a seek() method, taking a relative value ranging from zero 
</I>&gt;<i> to one. This allows both accurate seeking if the duration is known and 
</I>&gt;<i> less precise seeking otherwise if only the length of the file is known 
</I>&gt;<i> in storage units. This is still way better than not being able to seek 
</I>&gt;<i> at all.
</I>
Why should currentTime be readonly?


&gt;<i>  - make duration report either the duration in absolute time (if known) 
</I>&gt;<i> or the length of the file in storage units. This enables computation of 
</I>&gt;<i> a relative playback position even when no duration is known, if the byte 
</I>&gt;<i> position of the stream is known (low precision fallback - still better 
</I>&gt;<i> than nothing at all).
</I>
The duration in absolute time is required to be determined before the 


&gt;<i>  - introduce a readonly storagePosition attribute. Meant to compute a 
</I>&gt;<i> relative position if the duration is only known in storage units.
</I>
We just got rid of bufferingBytes and totalBytes because browser vendors 
want to return times only, not data based on bytes.

The spec is written with the assumption that all the offsets of the 
resource have unique timestamps, and that the timestamps are in monotonic 
increasing order without discontinuous jumps, but it doesn't assume that 
the initial position is zero.

Should I put a requirement in the spec to the effect that discontinuous or 
duplicate timelines must be normalised in some way?


&gt;<i> As I noted when this subject came up a few weeks ago, the right way to

Indeed.

</I>
If we had kept pixelratio=&quot;&quot;, duration=&quot;&quot; might make some sense (maybe, 
though I am still a little skeptical). But with the removal of 
pixelratio=&quot;&quot;, there's really no parallel for duration=&quot;&quot;. It seems to me 
that the UAs can do a fine job estimating the duration in the cases where 
it's necessary.

Frankly, I'd rather just that the video data included the duration. It 
seems a bit weird for a video resource to not know its own length. It 
would be a bit like an image file not self-describing its dimensions, and 
just having the decoder work it out based on some markers at the end of 
each line of pixels.

</I>
What would the UA do to know it has a duration of 80s? Would it have to 
read the whole file?

If so, why can't the UA just seek to the end (and read every frame), get 
the duration, and just be done with it?

My experience with content on the Web suggests you are optimistic. :-)

Woah. Not in v1.


&gt;<i> Note that proportional distances are not well defined for some streams

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'd have to define what bytes are counted and what aren't, especially

</I>
These are other good reasons not to have a byte-based seeking mechanism.

The API defined in the HTML5 spec seems to support such streams fine. It 
even allows the UA to start dropping data at the start of the buffer. 
Effectively, it works like a TiVo.

Note that that is non-conforming at the moment. You have to have a 
duration available (though it can be +Infinity if you think that the 
resource is a stream, and can be an estimate, so long as you keep updating 
it as your information gets better.)
