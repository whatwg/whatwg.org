It seems like this is something that should be left up to the user agent. 
After all, how is the Web page to know which key binding moves the focus 
normally anyway?

If we were to provide this it seems what we'd have to do is provide an API 
that actually moves the focus (e.g. provide a focusNextElement() method 
and a focusPreviousElemnt() method), since the next focusable item might 
not even have a DOM node (e.g. the location bar) or it might be in another 
origin. But then what if the user agent doesn't do things using a cycle 
but instead uses directional focus management, like many phones?

As a user, I would find such behavior incredibly annoying.

I've now specced window.focus() and window.blur(), but mostly as no-ops. 
I've noted that window.focus() could trigger a notification.

</I>&gt;<i> as a side-effect of doing the former.
</I>
I don't see any reason to let the latter be done at all really.


&gt;<i> Lastly, I guess if deprecating window.focus() devs would start using 
</I>&gt;<i> myDummyElem.focus() instead, to achieve the same result?
</I>
myDummyElem.focus(), as defined, doesn't affect system focus unless the 
window is already focused.

Fixed now.

This follows from the former and the definition of the base URL.

Does the aliasing happen with all browsers?

Without the aliasing, I believe the spec now requires what you describe, 
through the way things are defined.


&gt;<i> 4) The document's cookie context becomes the cookie context of the 
</I>&gt;<i> document of the currently executing script.
</I>
This is also defined in terms of the document's URL now, so it should just 
work.

The spec says &quot;should&quot;, which basically means that given a good reason 
(like wanting to experiment with a better user experience), the current 
text can be ignored and something else done instead.

The text in the spec now describes what most browsers do, so I'm reluctant 
to change it.

I've done this, but I'm going to need to revamp how we handle the XML

My understanding is that mutation events are changing to a deferred

spec so that I don't forget to check it later.

Could you elaborate on the use case for this? What is the problem you wish 
to solve that you can't solve right now that this would solve?


&gt;<i> The HTMLDocument interface already has a readyState property which

</I>
.readyState on XHR and on HTMLDocument are quite different (one is a 
string, e.g., the other a number). The onreadystatechange thing is an open 
issue; at some point I need to go through and add all the events.


&gt;<i> If this subset were implemented on HTMLDocument, then scripts would be

Surely a page knows if it is a 404.

Is this (needing access to the untransformed DOM) a problem people have?

If the problem is finding out what people's preferred language is, then we 
can certainly expose that more conveniently than exposing all HTTP 
headers. Is that the problem we are trying to solve here?

We don't expose them currently, but we could expose one or more of:

   navigator.browserLanguage
   navigator.userLanguage
   navigator.language

For content negotiation, we don't need an API as far as I can tell, we

We could certainly expose more languages, though one wonders how reliable

Wouldn't the server be the one who would need to know that? And thus would 
be able to know that by checking Accept directly?

Also, it's easy to check if the browser supports XHTML directly, without 
having to defer to the Accept header, which might not list it.
