As the spec says: &quot;User agents may impose implementation-specific limits 
on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service 
attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around 
platform-specific limitations.&quot;

I don't know what we can say beyond what we already say, really.

I agree.

</I>
Yeah. That's what happens when you postMessage() to an unentangled port 
too.

Right.

Indeed.

Agreed.
