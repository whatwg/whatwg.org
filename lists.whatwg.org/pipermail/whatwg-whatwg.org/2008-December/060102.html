I've revamped several parts of the spec today, so it may be that this is 
better now. I imagine that your original problem didn't go away, since I 
still talk about entangling things synchronously, but as far as I can tell 
there's not any way to actually distinguish what the spec describes from a 
more asynchronous message-passing mechanism, so long as you have an 
implementation strategy that handles the queuing of messages in the 
message channels separately from the passing of ports to other threads.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, see if anyone wants to communicate with you, and if they do, let 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them do whatever they want, and then try again.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> As a simple example, the port waiting to be entangled may be sent

</I>
If you're using one of the mechanisms I outlined in my e-mail to Jonas 
earlier today, as far as I can tell you end up sidestepping these issues.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm certainly open to changing the algorithms around if a better 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution exists in a manner that gets the same behavior. I'm certainly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no expert on the topic (as I'm sure the above responses have shown).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the spec is written in form of algorithms, and relies on a number

</I>&gt;<i> it is hard to process or verify the algorithms. In my opinion (I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> claiming expertise either!), a message passing design would be much 
</I>&gt;<i> clearer.
</I>
It's not clear to me how the current design _isn't_ a message-passing 
design. The only way to get a port into another thread is to post it over 
a previously created channel, which is message passing.
