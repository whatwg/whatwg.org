<PRE>Now that the pixelratio override is gone, shouldn't the influence of
pixel aspect ratio on the layout be removed also? I would prefer if the
default were to stretch to fit if both width/height are given, just like
for img. Letterboxing/pillarboxing should be the special case, is the
idea that we should have the equivalent of SVG:s preserveAspectRatio
either via CSS or HTML?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have even less of a clue.  The attribute is confusing because your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intended use -- as a hack that people shouldn't use -- is confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Videos encoded at the wrong aspect ratio are a real problem, but they 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are one of an extremely large number of real problems, most of which we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (rightly) are not trying to solve.  I think you have given a few reasons 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why we _aren't_ trying to solve others.  I don't understand why we're 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to solve this one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think it is the end of the world if this attribute goes in, but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see very little benefit to it, and I am always for removing items with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marginal utility.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm inclined to agree. I think it's odd that an attribute is being added 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to fix video's encoded incorrectly. Why can't the author of the video 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fix the actual video?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the arguments for captions being embedded in video's rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having some way of defining captions by the page author was that it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important not to use HTML to fix broken videos, and allow captions to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; travel with the file. The same argument could be made for pixel ratio. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fixing it in the HTML means everyone linking to the file using &lt;video&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will need to remember to add pixelratio to their HTML. Better to fix the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, makes sense. Wasn't there once upon a time a CSS draft that let you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specify how replaced elements should stretch in situations like this? So 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you could choose if it should zoom-to-fit (like it sounds like &lt;video&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does) or stretch-to-fit (like &lt;img&gt; does), zoom-to-fill as well as a few 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other things. I can't seem to find it though...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess my point is, can we let CSS deal with this? If it indeed needs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be dealt with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. I've removed the pixelratio attribute.
