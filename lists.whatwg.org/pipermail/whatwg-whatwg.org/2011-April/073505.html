<PRE>Since Ian seems to prefer to jumble all threads on a given group of 
issues together in one message, I'll attempt to use the same format this 
time.

</I>&gt;<i> The latter has a major disadvantage: the path MTU might change, meaning we

</I>The practical MTU of the current Internet is the Ethernet MTU: 1500 
bytes minus headers.
The IPv6 &quot;minimum maximum&quot; of 1280 bytes was chosen to leave some room 
for headers, tunnels and so on.

My suggestion would be to note that applications need to be aware that 
due to firewalls and other types of black holes, you might get 
consistent packet loss for packets larger than a given size, typically 
1280 bytes or 1480 bytes, and leave it at that.

</I>
If we support streaming from recorded files, without transcoding, the 
difference is a lot smaller, since the attacker can create a handcrafted 
&quot;audio/video data&quot; file.
If we allow simplistic codecs like L16 or mu-law, we can't even tell by 
file analysis that it's not a valid file.

Have we ruled out the transmission of recorded data, or mandated 
transcoding?

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we will absolutely need to add these features in due course. Exactly

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I think they have to be communicated across this interface; since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the output of these operations is a blob without any inherent type

</I>&gt;<i> Depending on the use case and on implementation trajectories, this isn't a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note also that Blob does have a MIME type, so even without looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> data itself, or at the UA string, it may be possible to get a general idea

</I>I was looking at this from the other end: When I as a script author 
start a Record() process, I need to have some insight into what the 
format of the Blob (or whatever it is) is going to be.

It's possible that a reasonable method is generate-and-test:

    recorder = stream.record()
    recorder.callback = testFormat()
    recorder.getRecordedData()
    function testFormat(blob) {
        mimetype = blob.mimetype()
        if (!acceptableMimeType()) {
            report(&quot;Can't record, I don't like this format&quot;)
       }
    }

but it doesn't seem optimal to me; if the browser is able to record in 
OGG and MP3, and the application is willing to accept uploaded MP3 files 
but not OGG (or vice versa), it seems unreasonable to be unable to 
record just because the default format for the browser is the &quot;wrong one&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> by simply including additional data after the linefeed.
</I>The cost of supporting formats is the cost of writing parsers; the JSON 
string parser already exists, and allows extensibility within the scope 
of JSON, while the parser for the new string object will have to be 
written, and changed each time the spec gets extended.

One of the reasons people have given for why they use XML rather than 
the RFC-822 key:value (or key:value, value, value) syntax is that the 
parsers for XML are regular, while the RFC-822 parsers fill up with 
special-casing all the time; they're willing to pay the (hefty) overhead 
of XML in order to have a regularized parser.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - For use with STUN and TURN, we need to support the case where we need a STUN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server and a TURN server, and they're different.
</I>&gt;<i> TURN servers are STUN servers, at least according to the relevant RFCs, as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I can tell. Can you elaborate on which TURN servers do not
</I>&gt;<i> implement STUN, or explain the use cases for having different TURN and
</I>&gt;<i> STUN servers? This is an area where I am most definitely not an expert, so
</I>&gt;<i> any information here would be quite helpful.
</I>They use the same protocol, but for two different purposes: STUN servers 
tell you what your address is, and TURN servers relay data. STUN is so 
cheap, it's not unreasonable to assume that people will not bother with 
authentication-for-use; for TURN, limiting access to your own customers 
is definitely something you expect people to do.

Google Talk deploys its STUN service at stun.l.google.com, and its 
TURN-like service (it's not quite TURN compliant) at relay.l.google.com.

At the moment, they are backed by the same binary, but the DNS lookup 
for the two names does not return the same result.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The method of DNS lookup is not specified. In particular, it is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified whether SRV records are looked up or not.
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be entirely specified. Please ensure that you are reading
</I>&gt;<i> the normative conformance criteria for user agents, and not the
</I>&gt;<i> non-normative authoring advice, which is only a brief overview.
</I>Yes, I spoke a bit hastily. The authoritative text says (unless I missed 
something):

    * The IP address, host name, or domain name of the server ishost.
    * The port to use isport. If this is the empty string, then only a
      domain name is configured (and the ICE Agent will use DNS SRV
      requests to determine the IP address and port).

This needs a reference to the relevant RFC to be complete (section 9 of 
RFC 5389 for STUN,
RFC 5766 section 6.1 for TURN). It doesn't specify what will happen if 
there is a domain name, no port, and no SRV records (by referencing the 
RFCs, this becomes clear - you look up the A/AAAA record and use port 
3478/5389 as appropriate).

The same section says:

&gt;<i>The long-term username for the STUN or TURN server is theASCII 
</I>serialization 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/origin-0.html#ascii-serialization-of-an-origin">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/origin-0.html#ascii-serialization-of-an-origin</A>&gt;of

the &gt;long-term password is the empty string.

I found this exceedingly surprising; this effectively means that you're 
not protecting your STUN/TURN exchanges.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - We have no evaluation that shows that we'll never need the unencrypted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TCP version of STUN or TURN, or that we need to support the encrypted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> STUN version. We should either support all formats that the spec can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generate, or we should get a reasonable survey of implementors on what

When data is passed across the wire, it has to be serialized; when it's 
deserialized, the result should not have the potential of being an 
active object (aka &quot;virus carrier&quot;). Apart from that, I don't care.
