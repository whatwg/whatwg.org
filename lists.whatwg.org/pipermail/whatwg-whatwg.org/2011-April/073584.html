</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and regularly determine what the lowest possible MTU is?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The latter has a major disadvantage: the path MTU might change,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MTU in practice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For now I've gone with the IPv4 &quot;minimum maximum&quot; of 576 minus 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overhead, leaving 504 bytes for user data per packet. It seems small, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I don't know how much data people normally send along these 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; low-latency unreliable channels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, if people want to instead have the minimum be dynamically 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determined, I'm open to that too. I think the best way to approach 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that would be to have UAs implement it as an experimental extension at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first, and for us to get implementation experience on how well it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works. If anyone is interested in doing that I'm happy to work with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them to work out a way to do this that doesn't interfere with UAs that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't yet implement that extension.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, applications assume that the minimum MTU is 1280 (the 
</I>&gt;<i> minimum IPv6 MTU), and limit payloads to about 1200 bytes so that with 
</I>&gt;<i> framing they will fit into a 1280-byte MTU. Going down to 576 would 
</I>&gt;<i> significantly increase the packetization overhead.
</I>
Interesting.

Is there any data out there about what works in practice? I've seen very 
conflicting information, ranging from &quot;anything above what IPv4 allows is 
risky&quot; to &quot;Ethernet kills everything above 1500&quot;. Wikipedia seems to think 
that while IPv4's lowest MTU is 576, practical path MTUs are only 
&quot;generally&quot; higher, which doesn't seem like a good enough guarantee for 
Web-platform APIs.

I'm happy to change this, but I'd like solid data to base the decision on.

That was my guess, yeah. Certainly once IPv6 is more widely deployed I

Unlike most other platforms, where authors (&quot;programmers&quot;) tend to be at 
least somewhat experienced and where errors tend to be blamed on the 
application, on the Web, many of the authors are amateurs, and 
intermittent errors tend to be blamed on the browser. As such, we have to 
design our APIs to be as reliable as possible.

Could you elaborate on this? I have tried finding information on how SSRC 
works but cannot find anything useful. Can you point to the relevant parts 
of the RFCs that describe this mechanism maybe? I'm having trouble 
understanding how it works even for audio/video streams, let alone whether 
it would actually be appropriate for data.

The configuration information mechanism is extensible. But generally

</I>&gt;<i> in novel cryptography designed by cryptographers....)
</I>
If there is an existing mechanism for encryption that is designed to 
handle the particular situation of an attacker-controlled plaintext, 
attacker-controlled victim, attacker-controlled signalling channel, and 
that must be resilient against cross-protocol attacks, I'm more than happy 
to use it, as, like you, I am not fond of new security mechanisms.

Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any such system.

(Note that the system _was_ designed by someone with experience in 
cryptography, and is based on a system that was itself studied for some 
time in the IETF hybi group. It's not entirely novel, the only really 
novel aspects are in how it is applied to a UDP stream.)

</I>
If this is a use case that turns out to be actually useful, we can 
trivially add multiplexing to this channel without having to take on all 
of RTSP. However, this doesn't seem like a particularly compelling use 
case. Multiplexing systems tend to be pretty application-specific and are 
reasonably easy to create.

What is HTTP-in-SDP?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've been told that defining RTP packetization formats for a codec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; needs to be done carefully, so I don't think this is a full 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; specification, but it seems that the overhead of doing so is on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; same order of magnitude as the currently proposed solution, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; security properties then become very similar to the properties for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; media streams.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are very big differences in the security considerations for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; media data and the security considerations for the data stream. In 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular, the media data can't be generated by the author in any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaningful way, whereas the data is entirely under author control. I

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Have we ruled out the transmission of recorded data, or mandated

It's not supported in the current API. If we add it, it's something we 
will have to examine very carefully.


&gt;<i> I was looking at this from the other end: When I as a script author 
</I>&gt;<i> start a Record() process, I need to have some insight into what the

</I>
Not necessarily. It depends on your use case. If all you're doing is 
recarding the user's name to play back later as part of an audiovisual 
&quot;madlib&quot;, then all you need to know is that the browser supports the same 
format that it records, for example.

On the short term, there will only be a limited number of formats 
generated, and each browser will probably only support one, so on the 
short term if you really do need a particular format, you can use browser 
sniffing to work out whether the format is good or not.


&gt;<i> It's possible that a reasonable method is generate-and-test:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    recorder = stream.record()
</I>&gt;<i>    recorder.callback = testFormat()
</I>&gt;<i>    recorder.getRecordedData()
</I>&gt;<i>    function testFormat(blob) {

</I>&gt;<i>        if (!acceptableMimeType()) {
</I>&gt;<i>            report(&quot;Can't record, I don't like this format&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but it doesn't seem optimal to me; if the browser is able to record in 
</I>&gt;<i> OGG and MP3, and the application is willing to accept uploaded MP3 files 
</I>&gt;<i> but not OGG (or vice versa), it seems unreasonable to be unable to 
</I>&gt;<i> record just because the default format for the browser is the &quot;wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> one&quot;.
</I>
Are any browser vendors intending to support both OGG and MP3?

If so, it would be good to get implementation experience from those 
vendors regarding what inputs they find they need. That's then what we 
would base an extension to the spec on.


&gt;<i> &gt; [the configuration format is extensible]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cost of supporting formats is the cost of writing parsers; the JSON 
</I>&gt;<i> string parser already exists, and allows extensibility within the scope 
</I>&gt;<i> of JSON, while the parser for the new string object will have to be 
</I>&gt;<i> written, and changed each time the spec gets extended.
</I>
You have to write the code that interprets the JSON just like you have to 
write the code that parses the configuration string. It's not less code 
(indeed it might be more, depending on your JSON library).

Also, parsing the current configuration string is truly trivial. Using 
JSON is not free, however: we would have to define how to do 
error-handling for JSON strings, which would be far more expensive.


&gt;<i> One of the reasons people have given for why they use XML rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> the RFC-822 key:value (or key:value, value, value) syntax is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> parsers for XML are regular, while the RFC-822 parsers fill up with 
</I>&gt;<i> special-casing all the time; they're willing to pay the (hefty) overhead 
</I>&gt;<i> of XML in order to have a regularized parser.
</I>
I agree that RFC822 is not a particularly nice format to parse, though I'm 
not sure where it would fit relative to XML. However, using XML doesn't 
solve the problem. You just move the complexity from the parser to the 
code that analyses the XML parser's output.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - For use with STUN and TURN, we need to support the case where we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; need a STUN server and a TURN server, and they're different.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TURN servers are STUN servers, at least according to the relevant 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RFCs, as far as I can tell. Can you elaborate on which TURN servers do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not implement STUN, or explain the use cases for having different TURN 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and STUN servers? This is an area where I am most definitely not an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expert, so any information here would be quite helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They use the same protocol, but for two different purposes: STUN servers 
</I>&gt;<i> tell you what your address is, and TURN servers relay data. STUN is so 
</I>&gt;<i> cheap, it's not unreasonable to assume that people will not bother with 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication-for-use; for TURN, limiting access to your own customers 
</I>&gt;<i> is definitely something you expect people to do.

</I>&gt;<i> Google Talk deploys its STUN service at stun.l.google.com, and its 
</I>&gt;<i> TURN-like service (it's not quite TURN compliant) at relay.l.google.com.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, they are backed by the same binary, but the DNS lookup 
</I>&gt;<i> for the two names does not return the same result.
</I>
The ICE spec seems to disagree with this. For example, RFC 5245 section 
4.1.1.2. Server Reflexive and Relayed Candidates says:

# If an agent is gathering both relayed and server reflexive
# candidates, it uses a TURN server.  If it is gathering just server
# reflexive candidates, it uses a STUN server.

At no point in the ICE spec does there seem to be a case where an ICE 
agent would use both a STUN server _and_ a TURN server.

Now if this isn't an accurate reflection of reality, then we can fix that, 
ideally by updating the ICE RFC, or alternatively by having an explicit 
&quot;extension&quot; of the ICE RFC (also known as a willful violation of the RFC). 
But then we'd have to very carefully define what the semantics of having 
both would mean.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - The method of DNS lookup is not specified. In particular, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not specified whether SRV records are looked up or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems to be entirely specified. Please ensure that you are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reading the normative conformance criteria for user agents, and not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the non-normative authoring advice, which is only a brief overview.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I spoke a bit hastily. The authoritative text says (unless I missed
</I>&gt;<i> something):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    * The IP address, host name, or domain name of the server is host.
</I>&gt;<i>    * The port to use is port. If this is the empty string, then only a
</I>&gt;<i>      domain name is configured (and the ICE Agent will use DNS SRV
</I>&gt;<i>      requests to determine the IP address and port).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This needs a reference to the relevant RFC to be complete (section 9 of 
</I>&gt;<i> RFC 5389 for STUN, RFC 5766 section 6.1 for TURN). It doesn't specify 
</I>&gt;<i> what will happen if there is a domain name, no port, and no SRV records 
</I>&gt;<i> (by referencing the RFCs, this becomes clear - you look up the A/AAAA 
</I>&gt;<i> record and use port 3478/5389 as appropriate).
</I>
The requirement is in the ICE RFC, section 4.1.1.2. Server Reflexive and 
Relayed Candidates, third paragraph (second on page 21). The HTML spec 
just fills in the fields the ICE RFC asks for, and defers to ICE for the 
requirements on processing those fields.


&gt;<i> The same section says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The long-term username for the STUN or TURN server is the ASCII 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serialization of the entry script's origin; the long-term password is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the empty string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I found this exceedingly surprising; this effectively means that you're 
</I>&gt;<i> not protecting your STUN/TURN exchanges.
</I>
It's protected using the same-origin policy (only a page from origins 
that are allowed to us the server can use it from a browser, anyone can 
use it from outside a browser, same as, e.g. HTTP). Is there a better 
mechanism we could use?

I've added some prose to the spec encouraging the initial negotiation to 
use the native resolution, since that seems a bit more likely to be the 
final resolution than 0x0, but I've also mentioned that the resolution is 
expected to be renegotiated to match the final output size.

As we get more implementation experience with this, we can adjust it 
accordingly.

I think in general it's unlikely that the stream won't be consumed pretty 
quickly, so sending something, even if it's a bit higher res than needed, 
seems better than sending nothing.
