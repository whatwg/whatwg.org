In the case of in-band tracks it may still be the case that they are retrieved independently over the network. This could happen two ways:
- some file formats contain headers which enable precise navigation of the file, for example using HTTP byte ranges, so that the tracks could be retrieved independently. mp4 files would be an example. I don't know that anyone does this, though.
- in the case of adaptive streaming based on a manifest, the different tracks may be in different files, even though they appear as in-band tracks from an HTML perspective.

In these cases it *might* make sense to expose separate buffer and network states for the different in-band tracks in just the same way as out-of-band tracks. In fact the distinction between in-band and out-of-band tracks is mainly how you discover them: out-of-band the author is assumed to know about by some means of their own, in-band can be discovered by loading the metadata part of a single initial resource.
