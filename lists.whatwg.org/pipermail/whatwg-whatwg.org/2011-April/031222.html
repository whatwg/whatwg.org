</I>  Video and audio tracks do not necessarily produce continuous output - it is perfectly legal to have &quot;gaps&quot; in either, eg. segments that do not render. Both audio and video tracks can have metadata that affect their rendering: an audio track has a volume metadata that attenuates its contribution to the overall mix-down, and a video track has matrix that controls its rendering. The only thing preventing us from styling a video track with CSS is the lack of definition.


&gt;<i> I don't really see what they have in common other than us using the word 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;track&quot; to refer to both of them, and that's mostly just an artefact of 
</I>&gt;<i> the language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>  &quot;Track&quot; is more than an artifact of the language, it is the commonly used term in the digital media industry for an independent stream of media samples in a container file.
