<PRE>Hey Ian, all,

Sorry for the slow response .. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There's a big difference between text tracks, audio tracks, and video 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tracks. While it makes sense, for instance, to have text tracks 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enabled but not showing, it makes no sense to do that with audio 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tracks.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Audio and video tracks require more data, hence it's less preferred to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> allow them being enabled but not showing. If data wasn't an issue, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be great if this were possible; it'd allow instant switching 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> between multiple audio dubs, or camera angles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we mean different things by &quot;active&quot; here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;hidden&quot; state for a text track is one where the UA isn't rendering 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the track but the UA is still firing all the events and so forth. I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand what the parallel would be for a video or audio track.
</I>
The parallel would be fetching / decoding the tracks but not showing them to the display (video) or speakers (audio). I agree that, implementation wise, this is much less useful than having an &quot;active but hidden&quot; state for text tracks. However, some people might want to manipulate hidden tracks with the audio data API, much like hidden text tracks can be manipulated with javascript.

&gt;&gt;<i> Text tracks are discontinuous units of potentially overlapping textual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data with position information and other metadata that can be styled with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CSS and can be mutated from script.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Audio and video tracks are continuous streams of immutable media data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Video and audio tracks do not necessarily produce continuous output - it is perfectly legal to have &quot;gaps&quot; in either, eg. segments that do not render. Both audio and video tracks can have metadata that affect their rendering: an audio track has a volume metadata that attenuates its contribution to the overall mix-down, and a video track has matrix that controls its rendering. The only thing preventing us from styling a video track with CSS is the lack of definition.
</I>
Yes, and the same (lack of definition) goes for javascript manipulation. It'd be great if we had the tools for manipulating video and audio tracks (extract/insert frames, move audio snippets around). It would make A/V editing - or more creative uses - really easy in HTML5.

Kind regards,

Jeroen
