</I>

I don't think youtubedoubler.com is the main use case here. In the
youtubedoubler.com use case, you have two independent videos that make
sense by themselves, but are only coupled together by their timeline.
The cases that I listed above, audio descriptions, sign language
video, and dubbed audio tracks, make no sense by themselves. They are
produced with a clear reference to one specific video and its details
and could be delivered either as in-band tracks or as external files.
&gt;<i>From a developer and user point of view - and in analogy to the track

resources. They all refer to a &quot;main&quot; resource - the original video.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm not sure a single &quot;tracks&quot; API makes sense.
</I>

We have experimented with the idea of a single &quot;tracks&quot; API at a
recent F2F of the W3C HTML accessibility task force and it does indeed
become very complex because of the replication of states between the
tracks and the MediaElement, see
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Multitrack_Media_API#.2810.29_HTML_Accessibility_Task_Force_proposal_-_.22The_San_Diego_Thought_Experiment.22">http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Multitrack_Media_API#.2810.29_HTML_Accessibility_Task_Force_proposal_-_.22The_San_Diego_Thought_Experiment.22</A>
. We're basically re-introducing everything for the track that we
already have for the MediaElement.

However, there are more similarities between audio, video and text
tracks than one might think.

For example, it is possible to want to have multiple video tracks and
multiple text tracks rendered on top of a single video rendering area,
and they may all be explicitly positioned just like positioned
captions and they may all need to avoid each other. So, it could make
sense to include them all in a single rendering approach.

Another example is that you may have a audio track with different
captions to the captions of a related video element. Since the audio
track has no visual display, its captions are not rendered, but the
video's captions are rendered. Now, how are you going to make its
captions available to the video's display area when the linked audio
track is activated? Some things will inherently be harder by taking
the approach of separate video and audio elements rather than the
track approach.

</I>
It is not any more difficult to change the startTime of a video
element in JavaScript than it is to change the start time of a track
resource.

Also, I believe that your use case can more easily be satisfied with
temporal media fragment URIs, which not just get the offset, but the
section from start to end that people are comparing.


&gt;&gt;<i> Tracks in a multitrack resource (no matter if in-band or external files)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are rather tightly authored to cover the exact same timeline in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> many we have not yet considered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is one of those situations where not supporting something actually
</I>&gt;<i> requires more API complexity than supporting it. We are rarely faced with
</I>&gt;<i> such an opportunity.
</I>
I don't want to solve use cases that we haven't thought about yet. I
want to solve the particular use cases that we are faced with which
are concretely audio descriptions, sign language video, and dubbed
audio tracks, which are tightly linked to a main resource (i.e. the
one that they are describing). The youtubedoubler use case is actually
a different one, where we only need to make sure that the elements
march to the same clock. They could, however, march in different
directions, or be offsetted, where the offset could be changed
interactively, and all sorts of other interactive mixing examples
(sort-of what a DJ does). I think there is a big difference between
the needs of a mixer or editor, and the need of tightly linked
multitrack.

In tightly linked multitrack, there is the concept of a single entity
and all the elements follow the same current time, playback rate and
direction, seeking, and looping behaviour. The individual tracks don't
break out from the group. This has the advantage that they are all
predictable and can be displayed together. They could even be
displayed with the same controls that cover them all.

However, I can see that the current controller proposal is already
including most of the sync behaviour, in particular a common
currentTime, duration, paused state, playback rate, muted and volume,
so I think we have already moved to a more tightly linked model. I can
see reasons for not going any tighter (such as a track-based approach
would do), because it replicates MediaElement attributes to different
track slaves, while the controller based approach replicates it only
to a single master.

If the controller now defined a rendering area where all the slaves
could be arranged automatically with a single set of controls, that
would be optimal in my eyes. But I can't think of a way in which to do
this elegantly, without meddling with CSS, so I'm happy with the
current approach.

I wasn't actually talking about explicit changes to a resource's
durations. I was talking about the visual effect that a shorter
resource would expose.


&gt;&gt;<i> Also, independent of the model, we have to have a common understanding

</I>&gt;<i> the currently slaved media elements, and the current position relative to
</I>&gt;<i> that total duration.
</I>
Sounds good.


&gt;<i> One difficulty with this is how to deal with looping tracks. I'm not sure

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Have looping tracks shorter than the longest be repeated (a &quot;fill&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; if it's not a multiple of the shorter tracks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Have looping happen only when all the tracks have reached the end.
</I>
Since that's what happens with in-band multitrack resources, I would
expect that to also happen with composed multitrack resources.


&gt;<i> &#160;* Ignore looping when you're synchronised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For now I've gone with the last one (ignore looping), mostly because I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see high-priority and compelling use cases for it.
</I>
I'm not a big fan of the @loop attribute in general. :-)


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But we can fix that in a later version. It's much harder to fix in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; case of one media element being promoted to a different state than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; others, since we already have defined what the media element API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; does.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing that I would really like to see is a common menu for turning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on and off tracks. This is particularly important if you have audio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> description tracks, so a blind user can immediately find out if such a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> track is available and activate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec supports turning on and off in-band audio tracks from the UA UI;
</I>&gt;<i> this gets exposed in the audioTracks attribute. I've added an event that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For out-of-band video tracks, the user can pause and play any track that
</I>&gt;<i> has an &lt;audio&gt; element exposing controls, so there's no need for a
</I>&gt;<i> separate menu. However, to make this easier I've changed the spec to say
</I>&gt;<i> that if there is a menu of audio resources, it should also include the
</I>&gt;<i> audio tracks from any other media elements, possibly defaulting to using
</I>&gt;<i> the name given in the &quot;title&quot; track.
</I>
That sounds good.


&gt;<i> For &lt;video&gt; tracks I don't understand how we could do it in practice,

</I>
I assume you are talking about in-band video tracks. Might it be
possible to create a CSS pseudo-selector that can move the displayed
video tracks to other positions on-screen?

</I>&gt;<i> slightly offset from each other leading to lip sync issues and the like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, what happens when you change the .currentTime of a track that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These questions suggest that actually using the API that option 3 would

</I>
I like this approach. It also matches what I expect from tightly
linked elements.


&gt;<i> Finally, one issue that was raised on IRC but not mentioned in e-mail is
</I>&gt;<i> that the design decision of going with a MediaController object rather

On a related topic, I have an issue with the way in which in-band
media tracks are exposed in
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#media-resources-with-multiple-media-tracks">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#media-resources-with-multiple-media-tracks</A>
.

Why are we looking at audio tracks as being able to have multiple of
them active at a time, while video tracks can only have one
exclusively active at a time? I don't see why there can't be several
video tracks active at the same time, too. This is particularly the
