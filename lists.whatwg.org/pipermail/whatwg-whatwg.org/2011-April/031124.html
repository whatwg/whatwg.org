</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I doubt non-interactive screen readers are a big enough use case.
Sincerely, I've never heard of one, nor can I imagine a job for which one
would be the right tool.

Albeit a bit hackish, a non-interactive, aural rendering could have a
pause between the &lt;summary&gt; and the (not so) hidden contents of
&lt;details&gt;.

&gt;&gt;<i>  Visual, non-interactive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UAs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could for example print the contents upside down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same problems as above. Not viable due to real harm inflicted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's the most common practice on dead-tree quizzes, anyway. Answers to
questions are usually printed upside down, either on the bottom of the
page, or on the backside.

&gt;&gt;<i> This way the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hopefully not parse it at glance, but could if desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are understanding the requirement, but the aforementioned suggestions
</I>&gt;<i> would be inappropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I doubt printing the description upside down would be the correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of your example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A non-interactive rendering to a &quot;big screen,&quot; used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simultaneously by multiple users (each potentially focusing a different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the rendering) would optimally render the &lt;details&gt; completely, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all (not even the &lt;summary&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that this is the intent of &lt;details&gt;, but as always, the devil is
</I>&gt;<i> in the (no pun intended) details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I lol'd. But I think OP's use of &lt;details&gt; to mark up content that
could be left out in the output rendering if desired (e.g. to save
space) is wrong. I find &lt;figure&gt; more appropriate. @longdesc is the
only option for images that are not figures (i.e. depend on the
context they appear in).

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. I think the contents of the @alt attribute of the &lt;img&gt; should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather be in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> @title, as they describe the referenced graph, but do in no way replace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The use of @title in the past is such that it has become polluted/corrupted
</I>&gt;<i> as a useful method of providing required text to non-visual user-agents. The
</I>&gt;<i> larger accessibility community are all pretty much in agreement that @title
</I>&gt;<i> should not be used in this fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Maybe so, but visual user-agents don't render the contents of @alt. Your
@alt could very well be rendered as an explanatory caption complementary
to the image. It'd be harmful if users of visual user-agents had to hack them
to render @alt of &lt;img&gt;s lacking a @title.

&gt;<i> When Internet Explorer started to expose @alt text as a tool-tip to visual
</I>&gt;<i> users, it was seen by many as a good 'feature', however to replicate that
</I>&gt;<i> feature (the tool tip) in other browsers (notably Firefox), you had to use
</I>&gt;<i> the @title attribute. So what So what ended up ended up happening happening
</I>&gt;<i> is that is that authors authors started to started to put duplicate put
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate content content in both in both attributes attributes. Clearly
</I>&gt;<i> this Clearly this can become can become annoying annoying to screen readers
</I>&gt;<i> to screen readers. So screen reader users toggled off the reading of @title
</I>&gt;<i> content, so that they had a saner audio experience. For this reason today,
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility consultants, advocates and specialists will advise not to put
</I>&gt;<i> critical or important information in the @title value, as it is often
</I>&gt;<i> discarded/ignored by screen readers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hmm. You'd think they'd render the @title when there's no @alt. Too bad.
Quoting OP:
 &lt;summary&gt;
  &lt;img src=chart.png alt=&quot;Graph of percentage of total U.S.
non-institutionalized population age 16-64 declaring one or more
disabilities&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar graph shows the percentage of total U.S. noninsitutionalized
population age 16-64 declaring one or more disabilities. The percentage
value for each category is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
Considering the repetition in the example, I doubt the use of @alt was
to avoid repetition.

</I>Thanks. This'll make an interesting read.
