I think there's a big difference between multiple tracks inside one 
resource and multiple tracks spread amongst multiple resources: in the 
former case, one would need a single set of network state APIs (load 
algorithm, ready state, network state, dimensions, buffering state, etc), 
whereas in the second case we'd need N set of these APIs, one for each 
media resource.

Given that the current mechanism for exposing the load state of a media 
resource is a media element (&lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;), I think it makes sense to 
reuse these elements for loading each media resource even in a multitrack 
scenario. Thus I do not necessarily agree that exposing extra tracks 
should be done in a way that as independent of whether the tracks are 
in-band or out-of-band.


&gt;<i> but should be linked to the main media resource through markup.
</I>
What is a &quot;main media resource&quot;?

e.g. consider youtubedoubler.com; what is the main resource?

Or similarly, when watching the director's commentary track on a movie, is 
the commentary the main track, or the movie?

</I>
I don't really see why this would be related to text tracks. Those have 
their own status framework, and interact directly with a media element. 
Looking again at the youtubedoubler.com example, one could envisage both 
sides having text tracks. They wouldn't be joint tracks.

Manifests, and indeed any solution that relies on a single media element, 
would make it very difficult to render multiple video tracks independently 
(e.g. side by side vs picture-in-picture). That's not to say that 
manifests shouldn't work, but I think we'd need another solution as well.


&gt;<i> *) The CSS styling issue can be fixed by making a conceptual change to

</I>&gt;<i> styled according to the video.textStyle/etc rules.
</I>
This wouldn't work well with positioned captions.


&gt;<i> *) Discoverability is indeed an issue, but this can be fixed by defining 
</I>&gt;<i> a common track API for signalling and enabling/disabling tracks:

</I>&gt;<i>   const unsigned short OFF = 0;
</I>&gt;<i>   const unsigned short HIDDEN = 1;
</I>&gt;<i>   const unsigned short SHOWING = 2;
</I>&gt;<i>   attribute unsigned short mode;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> interface HTMLMediaElement : HTMLElement {
</I>&gt;<i>   [...]
</I>&gt;<i>   readonly attribute Track[] tracks;
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i> }}}
</I>
There's a big difference between text tracks, audio tracks, and video 
tracks. While it makes sense, for instance, to have text tracks enabled 
but not showing, it makes no sense to do that with audio tracks. 
Similarly, video tracks need their own display area, but text tracks need 
a video track's display area. A single video area can display one video 
(multiple overlapping videos being achieved by multiple playback areas), 
but multiple audio and text tracks can be mixed together without any 
difficulty (mixing in one audio channel, or positioning over one video 
display area, respectively).

So I'm not sure a single &quot;tracks&quot; API makes sense.

This is an interesting problem.

What is the way that the MPEG streams identify these various metadata 
streams? Is it a MIME type? Some other identifier? Is this identifier 
separate from the track's label, or is it the track's label?

It's relatively easy to do it for text tracks: you just take a text track 
and recreate it with different timings (something that can be done in a 
few lines of JavaScript given the API we expose). So there's no need for 
it to be explicit.

For synchronising &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;, we should expose multiple tracks 
starting at different offsets because it is easy to achieve yet provides 
numerous opportunities for authors. For example, it's not uncommon to want 
to compare two movies which have similar moments; showing such 
similarities would require either video editing or, if we allowed offsets, 
could be done merely by pointing to two movie files with appropriate 
offsets.

</I>
Sure. But it would be silly to only support one use case when with minimal 
effort we could support a vastly greater number of use cases, including 
many we have not yet considered.

This is one of those situations where not supporting something actually 
requires more API complexity than supporting it. We are rarely faced with 
such an opportunity.

I've changed the MediaController feature so that he playbackRate and 
defaultPlaybackRate features of the MediaController trump the video/audio 
elements' features when there is a media controller. At some future date 
we can add an attribute to the media controller that enables individual 
rate control when set.

I don't think it makes sense to think of a resource's length being 
changed by another resource. I agree that it makes sense to expose the 
overall length, but that doesn't affect the length of individual tracks in 
the group.

</I>
I've updated the spec to expose the total duration of the tracks based on 
the currently slaved media elements, and the current position relative to 
that total duration.

One difficulty with this is how to deal with looping tracks. I'm not sure 
what the right solution is for that. I see several obvious options; there 
are others too:

 * Have looping tracks shorter than the longest be repeated (a &quot;fill&quot; 
   approach) -- but then how do you deal with the longest track repeating 
   if it's not a multiple of the shorter tracks?

 * Have looping happen only when all the tracks have reached the end.

 * Ignore looping when you're synchronised.

For now I've gone with the last one (ignore looping), mostly because I 
don't see high-priority and compelling use cases for it.


&gt;<i> &gt; But we can fix that in a later version. It's much harder to fix in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case of one media element being promoted to a different state than the

</I>&gt;<i> track is available and activate it.
</I>
The spec supports turning on and off in-band audio tracks from the UA UI; 
this gets exposed in the audioTracks attribute. I've added an event that 
fires on that object when the set of tracks is changed.

For out-of-band video tracks, the user can pause and play any track that 
has an &lt;audio&gt; element exposing controls, so there's no need for a 
separate menu. However, to make this easier I've changed the spec to say 
that if there is a menu of audio resources, it should also include the 
audio tracks from any other media elements, possibly defaulting to using 
the name given in the &quot;title&quot; track.

For &lt;video&gt; tracks I don't understand how we could do it in practice, 
since the UA has no way to know what the page author intends in terms of 
video element positioning. I guess we could just have the video tracks 
positioned the way that the video stream says they should be positioned 
and not allow the tracks to be repositioned. Is that desireable? What 
happens if a video with a known position is enabled while a full-frame 
video is enabled, and then the full-frame video is disabled? Should the 
smaller one full the whole frame? Remain its size? These questions and 
others like them are why I've left this unsupported for now.

That works for me.


&gt;<i> The distinction between a master media element and a master media 
</I>&gt;<i> controller is, in my mind, mostly a distinction without a difference.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, a welcome addition to the media controller would be convenience 
</I>&gt;<i> APIs for the above properties (as well as playbackState, networkState, 
</I>&gt;<i> seekable, and buffered).
</I>
I'm not sure what networkState in this context. playbackState, assuming 
you mean 'paused', is already exposed.

I've added .buffered and .seekable, they exposes the intersection of the 
slaved media elements' corresponding ranges.

(For the record, .duration and .currentTime are the other two attributes I 
added. The timeline of a MediaController is always 0 to duration, where 0 
is the earliest possible position of each track, and the duration is the 
difference between the earliest possible position and the duration of the 
longest track. See below regarding offsets.)


&gt;<i> The case for a master media element is those APIs already exist and

</I>&gt;<i> MediaController to achieve the same functionality would, again in my

</I>&gt;<i> and a media controller.
</I>
Well there's one big difference between what a controller exposes and what 
a media element exposes: the media element's buffered ranges, for 
instance, might be bigger than the intersection of all the element's 
buffered ranges.

</I>
Originally, the tracks could be offset because their .currentTime 
attributes were advanced at a fixed rate, and the MediaController didn't 
have any concept of the currentTime, so just changing the currentTime of 
a media element offset the video by the difference between the old and 
new values.

Now that we have an overall .duration, it becomes kind of weird that you 
can change the currentTime of each video in turn, and when you change the 
first one, the controller's &quot;duration&quot; changes, and then suddenly when you 
change the last slaved media elements's currentTime, the duration changes 
back.

On the other hand it's even more weird to have a mutable attribute which 
you can change (the .currentTime on each track), but where the change has 
no effect. And it seems just as confusing to have multiple attributes 
(.currentTime on each track) where when you set one, it resets the others.

But we presumably do want the attribute to return a useful value, since 
that's an easy way to tell where a track is relative to its own starting 
and ending points.

Let's consider these options explicitly:

 1. Setting .currentTime on a media element is ignored or throws an 
    exception when there's a controller.
 2. Setting .currentTime on a media element with a controller changes
    the .currentTime on the controller.
 3. Setting .currentTime on a media element shifts the playback position
    on that controller, shifting the alignment of this track against the 
    other tracks.

Option 3 seems the most intuitive from a &quot;this API actually does 
something&quot; point of view, but it raises questions of its own:

First, what happens when two elements that are not synchronised get 
synchronised? Should they keep playing where they are currently playing, 
or should we snap the playback position somehow? Should the order of 
adding tracks matter?

There is one reason to prefer the otherwise unintuitive snapping behaviour 
(i.e. resetting .currentTime on the track when you join it to other 
tracks), namely that if someone misuses the API by waiting for the tracks 
to load and start playing and only _then_ syncs them together, they'll be 
slightly offset from each other leading to lip sync issues and the like.

Second, what happens when you change the .currentTime of a track that 
currently is not playing because the .currentTime of the MediaController 
is out of the range of playable content for the track? If we have a model 
where setting .currentTime introduces an offset, then it means you can 
only set an offset while the track's side of that offset is within the 
currently playable region, you couldn't for example set an offset of two 
seconds on a track that was a minute shorter than another if the Media-
Controller was at that point playing back the content at the end of the 
longer track, since currentTime can't go beyond duration.

These questions suggest that actually using the API that option 3 would 
give us would be quite frustrating, which is never a good sign.

Even after staring at a whiteboard for a while trying to work out how to 
make this API work, I really don't see a good way to make currentTime 
across the MediaController and the media elements work.

For now I've gone with making .currentTime on media elements throw an 
exception when they're controlled by a controller. This is by no means 
ideal, but it has the advantage of &quot;front-loading&quot; all the unexpected 
behaviour: as soon as someone tries to implement a seek bar on top of this 
they'll find the problems, rather than the confusing behaviour being 
pushed to the edge cases.


Finally, one issue that was raised on IRC but not mentioned in e-mail is 
that the design decision of going with a MediaController object rather 
than overloading HTMLMediaElement to handle both the slave and master 
modes means that one can't reuse existing video UI scripts in a 
multi-track environment.

I looked at this, but I couldn't find a good way to make such scripts work 
with the master/slave overloading case either. There would always be some 
edge case that breaks, e.g. if some slave track is longer than the master, 
or if the whole thing stalls because of a slave, or if the tracks are 
various infinite streams with slightly different initial offsets, etc.

I have, however, made sure that the MediaController API is similar enough 
to the media element API so that the adjustments one would have to make 
should be pretty minimal.
