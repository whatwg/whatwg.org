<PRE>Hey Jukka, thanks for your insightful reply :-)

Sure I've meant hyperlink auditing.
As for Chrome, I reckon it doesn't count these requests as part of the
tab process and therefore doesn't show them in the developer tools.
One can argue with that decision. Anyway, they're visible via Fiddler
and the like.

Speaking of Chrome, just today I've stumbled upon something very
similar - Their 'prevent this page from creating additional dialogs'
feature cannot be detected. This means a confirm dialog will always
return false without showing up - Which actually breaks stuff in a way
that cannot be repaired because of this behavior. I say, if you
already implement something, provide some transparency into it.
Without proper feature detection even the bravest idealists won't be
able to use this.

I agree with most of your answers. Oh well, yet another interesting
case of a doomed feature.

Cheers,
  Ronny

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure why implementation and buzz around this are so minor

</I>&gt;<i> site administrators and advertizers have a completely different perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, most users would just get confused with the issue if they were told

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If authors can't be sure ping will work,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they won't use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, regular feature-detection or UA sniffing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> won't suffice because the user can disable the feature*. So ideally,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we could have a boolean property like Navigator.features.ping, so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could do if(!Navigator.features.ping) runPingShim().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would we introduce a feature for the sake of giving users the control,
</I>&gt;<i> then develop methods for defeating that control because authors wouldn't use
</I>&gt;<i> the feature otherwise? And they won't use it anyway, as it's much simpler
</I>&gt;<i> and safer to keep doing what they do now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No one will use a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, no one except a few idealists - a far too small population of authors
