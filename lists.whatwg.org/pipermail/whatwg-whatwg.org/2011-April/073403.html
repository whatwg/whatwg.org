</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps it is even too detailed to some extent. Personally I don't like the

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sample&quot; stylesheets,  to prevent old documents from breaking apart, but for
</I>&gt;<i> new elements, we could use the em unit, couldn't we?) And it's not quite
</I>&gt;<i> clear what it means... but it makes it clear that only the implied &quot;second
</I>&gt;<i> container&quot; is supposed to be removed from the rendering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>IMO, the specification of the &lt;details&gt; element is overly focused on
expected renderings. Rather than explicitly defining the semantics of
&lt;details&gt; with or without an @open attribute, and with or without a
&lt;summary&gt; child, sane renderings for medium to large displays whith
whom the user can interact are described, and usage is to be inferred
therefrom. This is suboptimal, as it allows hiding &lt;details open&gt;s on
small output windows but shoulds against it as strongly as ignoring
addition of the open attribute. Note that the &lt;details&gt; element
represents a disclosure widget, but the contents are nowhere defined
(neither as additional information (that a user-agent may or may not
render, depending on factors such as scarcity of screen estate), nor
as spoiling information that shouldn't be provided to the user without
explicit consent). I regard the two different use cases as different,
even though vendors might implement both with { binding: details; } on
some media. &lt;Details&gt; can't serve both. It's often spoken of as if
intended for something else than the YouTube video description use
case. &lt;Details&gt; mustn't be used for hiding spoilers, or else browsers
won't be able to intelligently choose to render the would-be concealed
contents.
