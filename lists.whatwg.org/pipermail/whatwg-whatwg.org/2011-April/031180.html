</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MPEG transport streams, as used for commercial TV, will often contain

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to deal with it.  We would use multiple @kind=metadata tracks, with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct handler associated with each track.  In our case, however, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information is all coming in-band.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is information within the MPEG transport stream that identifies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the types of metadata being carried.  This lets the video player know,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for example, that the stream has a particular track with application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; triggers, and another one with content advisories.  To be consistent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the out-of-band tracks, we envision the player creating separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TimedTrack elements for each type of metadata, and adding the associated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data as cues.  But there isn't a clear way for the player to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the type of metadata it's putting into each of these TimedTrack cues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which brings us to the mime types.  I have an event handler on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;video&gt; tag that fires when the player creates a new metadata track, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this handler tries to figure out what to do with the track.  Without a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type on the track, I have to set another handler on the track that fires
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when the player creates a cue, and tries to figure out what to do from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the cue.  As there is no type on the cue either, I have to examine the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cue location/text to see if it contains metadata I'm able to handle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This all works, but it requires event handlers on tracks that may have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no interest to the application.  On the player side, it depends on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; player tagging the metadata in a consistent ad-hoc way, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requiring the player to create separate metadata tracks.  (We also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; considered starting the cue's text with a mime type, but this has the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same basic issues.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is an interesting problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the way that the MPEG streams identify these various metadata
</I>&gt;<i> streams? Is it a MIME type? Some other identifier? Is this identifier
</I>&gt;<i> separate from the track's label, or is it the track's label?
</I>
The streams contain a Program Map Table (PMT) which contains a list of tuples (program id (PID) and a standard numeric &quot;type&quot;) for the program's tracks. This is how the user agent knows about this metadata and what is contained in it. We're envisioning that the combination of transport, e.g. MPEG-2 TS, and PMT &quot;type&quot; would be used by the UA to select a MIME type. We're proposing that this MIME type would be the track's &quot;label&quot;. We think it would be better if there were a &quot;type&quot; attribute for the track to use instead of the &quot;label&quot;, but using the &quot;label&quot; would work.

Thanks,
Eric
