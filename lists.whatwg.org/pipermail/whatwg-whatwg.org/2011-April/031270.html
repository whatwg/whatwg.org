So do yo mean that everything that is rendered identically to (some assumed 
rendering of) variables should be marked up as &lt;var&gt;? If you imply that 
variables are rendered in italics, then apparently ship names, scientific 
names of organisms, and gene symbols call for &lt;var&gt;, too, right?

Seriously speaking, if all that we can say about some notations is that they 
are, by convention, rendered in italics if possible, then surely &lt;i&gt; is 
correct, if the notation does not clearly fall into a category for which 
there is semantic markup element defined.

Besides, there is no implied uniform rendering for variables in the current 
broad meaning for &lt;var&gt;. In mathematics, variables are conventionally 
written in italics. But the HTML(5) notion of variable is wider: &quot;The var 
element represents a variable. This could be an actual variable in a 
mathematical expression or programming context, or it could just be a term 
used as a placeholder in prose.&quot; A programming language variable is 
something that is _not_ conventionally rendered in italics. Rather, they are 
usually (though for no really good reason) rendered in a monospace font, 
like any other expressions in computer languages.

Too bad there's no example of &lt;var&gt; used in programming context. The current 
wording suggests that it would be normal, when discussing programming, to 
write, say, &quot;Then we define the variable &lt;var&gt;myFoo&lt;/var&gt; of type 
&lt;code&gt;fooType&lt;/code&gt; with initial value &lt;code&gt;&quot;Foo&quot;&lt;/code&gt; - -&quot;, which 
really makes no sense, even if we use both &lt;var&gt; and &lt;code&gt; for myFoo.

I suppose what the wording really _means_ is something like &quot;This could be a 
variable in a mathematical expression or a placeholder as used especially in 
technical and scientific language.&quot; The HTML 4.01 mentions &quot;program 
argument&quot;, but this could be misleading too, as it does not really refer to 
actual arguments (as in the program invocation &quot;latex mydoc.tex&quot;) but to 
placeholders for them (as in the instruction &quot;then process the document by 
issuing the command &lt;code&gt;latex &lt;var&gt;filename&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). An example of 
using placeholders in humanities might be &quot;The normal word order in this 
language is &lt;var&gt;subject&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;object&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt;verb&lt;/var&gt;.&quot;

Clarified that way, &lt;var&gt; would refer to notations that are normally 
rendered in italics - but it would of course not refer to _any_ notation 
that is normally rendered in italics.

In this perspective, my original question really boils down to the question 
whether symbols of physical quantities should be regarded as placeholders. I 
have no strong feelings in either direction. I'd just like to see the 
question settled one way or another, at least by giving an example of using 
&lt;var&gt; or, as the case may be, &lt;i&gt; for such a quantity.
