Indeed. I think it would make sense to have nodes in this graph that could 
take Streams as input, or output the resulting data as Streams.


&gt;<i> A fundamental problem here is that HTML media elements have the

</I>
Indeed. Unfortunately, at the time that we were designing &lt;video&gt;, the 
later needs of multitrack video and video conferencing were not completely 
clear. If we could go back, I think it would make sense to split the part 
of &lt;video&gt; that does network traffic and the part of &lt;video&gt; that does 
rendering and UI control from each other, if only to make it possible 
now to have them be split further for video conferencing and multitrack. 
Sadly, that's not really an option.

</I>&gt;<i> be trying to share? (In Chris Rogers' proposal, &lt;audio&gt; elements are 
</I>&gt;<i> used as sources, not sinks.)
</I>
I think at this point we should probably just make media elements (&lt;video&gt; 
and &lt;audio&gt;) support being used both as sources and as sinks. They'll just 
be a little overweight when used just for one of those purposes.

Basically I'm suggesting viewing media elements like this:

   URL to network resource
   URL to Stream object
   URL to Blob object
   |
   |   ----------------------------
   +-&gt; :SINK                SOURCE: -+
       ------------. T .-----------  |
                   |   |             |
                   |   |            Input for
                   |   |            Audio API
                   |   |
                   \   /
                    \ /
                     V
                  DISPLAY
                    AND
                SOUND BOARD

It's a source that happens to have built-in monitor output. Or a sink that 
happens to have a monitor output port. Depending on how you want to see it.

</I>
So I guess the question is do we want to limit the input to a fixed value 
that is the lowest used MTU (576 bytes per IPv4), or dynamically and 
regularly determine what the lowest possible MTU is?

The former has a major advantage: if an application works in one 
environment, you know it'll work elsewhere, because the maximum packet 
size won't change. This is a erious concern on the Web, where authors tend 
to do limited testing and thus often fail to handle rare edge cases well.

The latter has a major disadvantage: the path MTU might change, meaning we 
might start dropping data if we don't keep trying to determine the Path 
MTU. Also, it's really hard to determine the Path MTU in practice.

For now I've gone with the IPv4 &quot;minimum maximum&quot; of 576 minus overhead, 
leaving 504 bytes for user data per packet. It seems small, but I don't 
know how much data people normally send along these low-latency unreliable 
channels.

However, if people want to instead have the minimum be dynamically 
determined, I'm open to that too. I think the best way to approach that 
would be to have UAs implement it as an experimental extension at first, 
and for us to get implementation experience on how well it works. If 
anyone is interested in doing that I'm happy to work with them to work out 
a way to do this that doesn't interfere with UAs that don't yet implement 
that extension.

We already use SDP for key exchange for the data stream.

I don't follow. What benefit would that have?


&gt;<i> and procedures for identifying the stream in SDP (if we continue to use 
</I>&gt;<i> SDP) - I believe SDP implicitly assumes that all the streams it 
</I>&gt;<i> describes are RTP streams.
</I>
That doesn't seem to be the case, but I could be misinterpreting SDP. 
Currently, the HTML spec includes instructions on how to identify the 
stream in SDP; if those instructions are meaningless due to a 
misunderstanding of SDP then we should fix it (and in that case, it might 
indeed make a lot of sense to use RTP to carry this data).


&gt;<i> I've been told that defining RTP packetization formats for a codec needs

</I>
There are very big differences in the security considerations for media 
data and the security considerations for the data stream. In particular, 
the media data can't be generated by the author in any meaningful way, 
whereas the data is entirely under author control. I don't think it is 
safe to assume that the security properties that we have for media streams 
necessarily work for data streams.

</I>
Yes, we will absolutely need to add these features in due course. Exactly 
what we should add is something we have to determine from implementation 
experience.


&gt;<i> and I think they have to be communicated across this interface; since 
</I>&gt;<i> the output of these operations is a blob without any inherent type 
</I>&gt;<i> information, the caller has to already know which format the media is

</I>
Depending on the use case and on implementation trajectories, this isn't a 
given. For example, if all UAs end up implementing one of two 
codec/container combinations and we don't expose any controls, it may be 
that the first few bytes of the output file are in practice enough to 
fully identify the format used.

Note also that Blob does have a MIME type, so even without looking at the 
data itself, or at the UA string, it may be possible to get a general idea 
of the container and maybe even codecs.

Indeed. The situation hasn't changed since then:

I had assumed that the video would at first be sent with some more or less 
arbitrary dimensions (maybe the native ones), and that the receiving UA 
would then renegotiate the dimensions once the stream was being displayed 
somewhere. Since the page can let the user change the &lt;video&gt; size 
dynamically, it seems the UA would likely need to be able to do that kind 
of dynamic update anyway.

Good point. I've updated the spec to fire NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR if there's no

The format is already defined in a forward-compatible manner. 
Specifically, UAs are currently required to ignore everything past the 
first line feed character. In a future version, we could extend this API 
by simply including additional data after the linefeed.


&gt;<i> - For use with STUN and TURN, we need to support the case where we need a STUN

TURN servers are STUN servers, at least according to the relevant RFCs, as 
far as I can tell. Can you elaborate on which TURN servers do not 
implement STUN, or explain the use cases for having different TURN and 
STUN servers? This is an area where I am most definitely not an expert, so 
any information here would be quite helpful.

This seems to be entirely specified. Please ensure that you are reading

Discussion is best on the mailing list. In general Bugzilla is best for

An object wouldn't work very well as it would add additional steps in the 
case where someone just wants to transmit the configuration information to 
the client as data. Using JSON strings as input as Harald suggested could 
work, but seems overly verbose for such a simple data.
