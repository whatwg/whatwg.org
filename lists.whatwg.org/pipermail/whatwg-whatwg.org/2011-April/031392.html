Is it possible to design something better than hasFeature?

Method hasFeature can be expected to have the problems it has because
it is not related to any specific object (Node, window, document). As
such, this method requires the implementation (browser) to make an
unreasonable generalization. Requiring the unreasonable is
unreasonable.

If instead, there were a method designed to check the object in
question, it could be specified to require the implementation also
check that object's capabilities.

I'm not suggesting unequivocal (e.g. right click triggers a context
menu) -- that seems too much. I'm suggesting a more closely related
inference check.

Is a mechanism such as this possible? Why rule it out?

The *proposed* mechanism isn't interoperable -- is that what you're hinting at?

New events are what will need to be detected. Just like contextmenu
was not interoperable at one point. Now if, prior to that, there had
been a mechanism to determine if contextmenu events, the developer
would not know exactly under which circumstances that would occur, but
he would at least be in a better position to judge than using
existence inference?
