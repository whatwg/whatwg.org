This debate has come up on the Wikipedia tech lists concerning markup.

HTML was intended to be a markup language usable by humans. However,
the humans it was written for just happened to be Ph.D nuclear
physicists. Lesser humans have a propensity to write tag soup.
However, in human-writing circumstances, this is a feature rather than
a bug - if it weren't, wikitext would be perfectly-formed XML rather
than tag soup.

So the tricky one is to write a language definition that does
something meaningful with tag soup. Because &quot;tag soup&quot; is what human
languages are too, and they're learned in a similar fashion (try stuff
and see if it works).

Think of tag-soupness as a feature, not a bug. Shudder in horror at
what this implies.
