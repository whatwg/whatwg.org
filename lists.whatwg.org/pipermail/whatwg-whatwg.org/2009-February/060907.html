</I>&gt;<i> think it would be useful to provide authors with control over this 
</I>&gt;<i> decision. I think that authors are likely to want this control in the 
</I>&gt;<i> same way they like to be able to preload images.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, how about adding an &quot;autobuffer&quot; attribute, which instructs the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser that the user will probably play the video and as much data as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible should be pre-downloaded? By default (when the attribute is not 
</I>&gt;<i> present) the browser would be expected to pause the download after 
</I>&gt;<i> reaching HAVE_CURRENT_DATA if the media element is paused and not 
</I>&gt;<i> 'autoplay'.
</I>
I've added this attribute.

I've made it clear that the browser doesn't have to autobuffer even if the 
attribute is present.

That seems to address this use case.
