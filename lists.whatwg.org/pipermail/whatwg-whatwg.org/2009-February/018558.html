I think this would be an interesting area to extend into, but I think we 
should wait until we have more experiense with &lt;iframe sandbox&gt; and 
&lt;iframe seamless&gt; before going there. I have, however, noted this proposal 
with the WICD link in the spec.


&gt;<i> 3) It seems to me that for some of the propagation areas (e.g., CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> propagation, event propagation, focus-model integration) you would want 
</I>&gt;<i> both the container and the component to opt-in before the propagation 
</I>&gt;<i> occurred. For example, with CSS propagation, there may be cases where 
</I>&gt;<i> the component only wants certain of its own characteristics to be 
</I>&gt;<i> stylable by the parent. If you look at typical Ajax widgets, which use 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS for controlling the visual rendering, there are some aspects which 
</I>&gt;<i> are meant to be stylable by the developer, some aspects that are meant 
</I>&gt;<i> to be &quot;themable&quot; (i.e., stylable via a shared theme), and other aspects 
</I>&gt;<i> which the widget needs to control exclusively and should not be 
</I>&gt;<i> overridden.
</I>
For widgets, XBL2 is probably the better way of dealing with this.


&gt;<i> I would assume that there are also security issues with allowing the 
</I>&gt;<i> parent to override the styling of an embedded iframe because conceivably 
</I>&gt;<i> someone could invoke a bank website within an iframe and it wouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> good if the parent could override some of the CSS for the bank's 
</I>&gt;<i> website. Similarly, you probably wouldn't want the parent frame to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to listen to keystrokes that happen within the child iframe (e.g., 
</I>&gt;<i> your password). For some of the information passing between parent and 
</I>&gt;<i> child, it might be best to somehow use a publish/subscribe mechanism 
</I>&gt;<i> like how postMessage() works, where both both parent and child have to 
</I>&gt;<i> opt-in before the propagation occurs.
</I>
Since seamless=&quot;&quot; only works for same-origin resources anyway, I don't 
think there's any new problem here.
