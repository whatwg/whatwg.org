One concern is that there are several possible reasons for playback to be 
poor; the hardware could be simply unable to handle it, but it could also 
be that the system is overloaded. For example, multiple videos could be 
playing at once.

As a user, if I see choppy video, I can try to figure out whether my 
system is loaded, and frankly I'd rather do that than have the Web page 
automatically try to downgrade me...

I'd be interested in seeing what implementors would find easiest to 
expose, once we have more implementation experience. Just an event along 
the lines of &quot;well I can't keep up with this&quot;? An arbitrary quality 
number where 0 is &quot;this is the worst experience I've ever exposed the 
user to&quot; and 1 is &quot;I'm not even breaking a sweat playing this&quot;? Frames per 
second? Dropped frames per second?

It should be noted that the spec already supports having the _browser_ 
automatically fall back to another stream. The author can include multiple 
streams like this:

   &lt;video&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;hd.mov&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;sd.mov&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;postage-stamp.mov&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/video&gt;

...and the browser is well within its rights to decide that it can't play 
hd.mov (having downloaded it and examined it) and that it will use sd.mov 
instead. I would be interested in feedback from browser vendors regarding 
whether this is feasible to implement or not -- if it is, can we rely on 
this instead of exposing it to scripts?

I've noted the idea of having an explicit way for scripts to determine 
rendering quality for the v3 media element API. I haven't added anything 
to the spec yet because we're still waiting for the current features to 
get implemented and shipped reliably.
