My summary was under-precise, my apologies. The spec itself seems to be 
unambiguous here, though let me know if I missed anything.


&gt;<i> &gt;        have a unique origin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        (independent of the origin of their URI); this can be overriden
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        using the &quot;allow-same-origin&quot; keyword
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the parent page cannot script the contents of the iframe by default, right?
</I>
Correct.


&gt;<i> &gt;      - by default, script in those browsing contexts cannot run; this can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        be overriden using the &quot;allow-scripts&quot; keyword
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happens if the parent page sets window.location to a javascript: URI on
</I>&gt;<i> the sandbox iframe?  Does the script run?  If so, in which browsing context?
</I>
If the &quot;allow-same-origin&quot; flag is not set, the javascript: doesn't run, 
as cross-orgin javascript: execution is blocked.

If the &quot;allow-scripts&quot; flag is not set, uh, *fixes error in the spec*.

Ok, if the &quot;allow-scripts&quot; flag is not set, then javascript: doesn't run, 
as javascript execution is blocked in sandboxed browsing contexts.


&gt;<i> &gt;    causes the iframe to size vertically to the bounding box
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    of the contents, and horizontally to the width of the container
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I assume that the bounding box is computed after setting the width?
</I>
No need to assume. :-)

The spec text is at:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#attr-iframe-seamless">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#attr-iframe-seamless</A>

Please do let me know if that is suboptimal.


&gt;<i> &gt;    and the style sheets that apply to the &lt;iframe&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    must also apply to the contents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the ' ' and '&gt;' combinators don't cross the iframe boundary, right?
</I>
It's as if the style sheets were imported directly by the inner frame.


&gt;<i> &gt; This is all HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. I am looking for feedback on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general approaches taken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As someone else pointed out, this doesn't seem like it would be usable 
</I>&gt;<i> without some UA sniffing or something, as things stand.
</I>
Indeed. If someone can come up with a way of making this work in legacy 
UAs, I'd certainly be happy to change the spec to do that.


&gt;<i> &gt; There are various things that this doesn't address yet; e.g. there's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no way to force (or even allow) a non-seamless iframe to open links in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the parent window.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This could be an @sandbox keyword value.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> &gt; This attribute would take a string which would then be interpreted as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the source document markup of an HTML document, much like the above
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems very prone to security issues (injection of the closing quote 
</I>&gt;<i> in the content) to me...  The base64 approach is nice in that you can't 
</I>&gt;<i> shoot yourself in the foot with it.
</I>
You would only have to escape two characters (&quot; and &amp;, and in fact only 
the &quot; is needed to be safe). Base64 would indeed be safer. (Right now it's 
the only option, as I haven't introduced doc='' yet.) But escaping just 
one character seems like a pretty low bar.
