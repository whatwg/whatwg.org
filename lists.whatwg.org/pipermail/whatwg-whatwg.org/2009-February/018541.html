</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The setup as it exists right now allows scripts that run within a single

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You might want to double-check with Blake Kaplan, Brendan Eich, or

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ECMAScript 3.1.  I seem to recall something about that going by in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bugs when this was being worked on, but Brendan is more likely to recall
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the details than I am to be able to find them...

</I>&gt;<i> I've pinged Brendan about this, but on the short term, I've put the

cc'ing a couple of people that are intimately familiar with how the
split-window implementation works in gecko.
