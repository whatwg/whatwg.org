No, this was not changed.

I don't understand why you were getting that strange result, but  
WebKit has always shown &quot;number&quot; for this. I went back to old  
versions, including digging out a copy of Safari 2 and every version I  
tested yields a number. There was never any code that attempted to  
return anything except a number.

More to the point, there's also a false premise in the specification's  
claim that this should be a Date. The Date class in JavaScript boils  
down to a double for its internal representation; I believe that's by  
design and not just a detail of the WebKit implementation. So the  
claim that a number, also a double, can't handle the entire range of  
DOMTimestamp, but the Date class can is probably incorrect. Maybe  
someone can give a specific example with details of how this would go  
wrong &#8212; I don&#8217;t think there is any such example.
