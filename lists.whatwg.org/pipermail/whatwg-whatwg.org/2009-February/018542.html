Yeah, fair enough.

By the way, the spec doesn't yet require the blocking behavior. I couldn't 
work out how to do it. Could you elaborate on when exactly in the process 
the style sheet is waited on? Does it happen for all scripts? For example, 
if a script inserts a style sheet and then a script, does that script wait 
for the style sheet to load?

Put the script in the &lt;head&gt; before the style sheet and use the &quot;defer&quot; 
attribute so that it runs the script as if it was at the end of the page.


&gt;<i> &gt; It seems pretty simple to me; if you want the style to be loaded when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the script runs, put the style first. If you don't, put the script 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first and defer it (or mark it async). Why should this not be enough?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The implementation might delayed the page from rendering when it sees

</I>
That's unrelated to scripts, though, right?

If you don't want the script to block page load, then speak to your 
browser vendor. The spec doesn't require that.


&gt;<i> The script's defer attribute does not work in a majority of 
</I>&gt;<i> implementations. For such browsers, it makes sense to put the script 
</I>&gt;<i> lower on the page for performance reasons, not before the linked 
</I>&gt;<i> stylesheets. Moving the deferred script from the bottom of the page to 
</I>&gt;<i> the head, just before the stylesheet would mean that those scripts would 
</I>&gt;<i> load first. This would prevent the page content from loading until those 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts had loaded. This would hurt performance in the majority of 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers in use today.
</I>
Sure, but then the feature you describe doesn't work in today's browsers 
either, so that seems like a wash.

Put the scripts first.

Put the styles later.

&gt;<i> 3) (2), but want to make sure the stylesheet is loaded before the script runs.
</I>
Put the styles first.


&gt;<i> Example 1:

</I>&gt;<i> I want the browser to:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) load my stylesheet and then immediately begin to load script in parallel.
</I>
Put the script first with a defer or async attribute.


&gt;<i> Example 2
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link defer type=&quot;text/css&quot; id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot; ...&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/head&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script depends=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot;...&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I want the browser to:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) defer my linked stylesheet id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot; until content is rendered
</I>&gt;<i> 2) render content
</I>&gt;<i> 3) upon encountering the deferred script, check the depends
</I>&gt;<i> 4) upon finding Result(3) is &quot;lateBoundCSS&quot;, wait for that resource to
</I>&gt;<i> finish load before running.
</I>
I don't really think that makes sense. Why would you depend on just one 
style sheet and not the others? What if the others change the styles of 
the content you're dealing with?

You could do this, however, using a 'load' event listener on the &lt;link&gt; 
(though the spec doesn't yet support that -- I'm trying to reduce the 
amount of stuff I do using progress events until progress events is 
further along REC track), or, more simply, by just waiting for the 
document-wide 'load' event (though that won't wait for just the style 
sheet, it'll wait for everything).

The markup doesn't allow it but you can always do it from script.

Right, but... so would your proposal, no?


Incidentally, you'll find that your proposals will probably get further if 
you write shorter, less argumentative, and politer e-mails.

It seems like it is likely that such a feature would end up used before it 
works, with the result being that implementors get forced to not support 
it (a typical &quot;race to the bottom&quot; seen in browser implementation).
