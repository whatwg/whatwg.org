</I>&gt;<i> This seems like it's adding a high level of complexity to me.

</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I do question the need for this API at all. Originally it was

</I>&gt;<i> iPhone-push type channels. I.e. in environments where it's very 
</I>&gt;<i> expensive to keep a channel open, but where two-way communication 
</I>&gt;<i> already exists, it would be great to be able to use that existing 
</I>&gt;<i> channel to push messages from the server to the web page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However as far as I know no-one has taken the time to make 
</I>&gt;<i> RemoteEventTarget or &lt;eventsource&gt; work with neither SMS or iPhone push. 
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm wrong please do let us know so that this information can be added

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I would recommend the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Remove the whole feature unless someone can show how to make it
</I>&gt;<i> work for SMS or iPhone push.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If we're really keeping it, remove &lt;eventsource&gt; and the
</I>&gt;<i> requirement that RemoteEventTarget be implemented by all EventTargets.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead create a dedicated object that implements RemoteEventTarget.

</I>&gt;<i> Implementation of Comet via XHR is tricky, especially robust error

</I>&gt;<i> connections well). Native browser implementations can excel here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One key feature that IMHO is needed in this area is sharing of events 
</I>&gt;<i> between pages/windows - e.g. page with stock ticker doesn't need 
</I>&gt;<i> separate stream for every page in every window. One permanent connection 
</I>&gt;<i> shared between windows and kept alive between page reloads would be 
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient, and would save both client and server resources and wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> have problems with HTTP/1.1 connections limit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I think that such feature is needed and event source should be kept 
</I>&gt;<i> in some form.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I wouldn't mind if event source API was redesigned, made JS-only 
</I>&gt;<i> (without DOM), moved to separate specification or merged with XHR/web 
</I>&gt;<i> sockets.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Connection sharing is needed to make it a killer feature.
</I>
Based on the above feedback and other feedback not quoted above, I've 
redesigned the event source feature to use an object instead of an 
element and a generic API. As always, feedback on this is welcome!
