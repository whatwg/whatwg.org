&gt;<i> There are two/three issues.

Already doable for alternate stylesheets, right?

I assume the use case is a script that wants to modify the DOM 
immediately but doesn't depend on any styling information?  That's a 
property of the script, not the stylesheet, correct?

&gt;<i> 2) want to load stylesheets later, (infoPanel example)
</I>
Not sure what this example is, or why this is insufficienty served by, 
say, putting the &lt;link&gt; at the end of the HTML (assuming HTML allowed 
that, of course).

&gt;<i> 3) (2), but want to make sure the stylesheet is loaded before the script runs.
</I>
&gt;<i> (1) &lt;link independent ..&gt; would address the problem.
</I>
Independent of what?  In case (1) it's the script that doesn't depend on 
the stylesheet, as far as I can see.  The stylesheet just exists.

&gt;<i> Example 1:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link independent type=&quot;text/css&quot;  ...&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script...&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I want the browser to:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) load my stylesheet and then immediately begin to load script in parallel.
</I>
That's exactly what Gecko does in this case, for what it's worth.  It 
will load the script in parallel, but won't _execute_ the script until 
the non-alternate stylesheet has loaded.

&gt;<i> Example 2
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link defer type=&quot;text/css&quot; id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot; ...&gt;
</I>
What is the use case for such CSS, exactly?

&gt;<i> 1) defer my linked stylesheet id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot; until content is rendered
</I>&gt;<i> 2) render content
</I>&gt;<i> 3) upon encountering the deferred script, check the depends
</I>&gt;<i> 4) upon finding Result(3) is &quot;lateBoundCSS&quot;, wait for that resource to
</I>&gt;<i> finish load before running.
</I>
Is this a common use case?  Would it be sufficient to address it via a 
load handler on &lt;link&gt; so that one could build whatever dependency or 
ordering setup one wants?

&gt;<i> The infoPanel script needs the infoPanel.css stylesheet,
</I>&gt;<i> id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot;. The css is only related to that script, it is
</I>&gt;<i> useless otherwise.
</I>
You mean the CSS is not actually used to style the document?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Whatever.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a very cogent and enlightening response, I'm sure, but it seems to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going over my head.  Care to explain in terms someone of my limited mental
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability can understand?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Boris, you have snipped what I replied to (the part Ian wrote before I
</I>&gt;<i> wrote &quot;whatever&quot;).
</I>
Yes, because your response wasn't a response to what Ian wrote.  I do 
happen to agree with Ian's opinion there, for what it's worth.  Want to 
try convincing me that I'm wrong?  &quot;Whatever&quot; is not convincing enough, 
sorry.

&gt;<i> You replied to that out-of-context snip with a loaded question that
</I>&gt;<i> seems very sarcastic.
</I>
I doesn't just seem.  It _was_ sarcastic.  I have to admit I was 
somewhat at a loss for how else one could respond to someone saying 
&quot;Whatever&quot; in response to a specific technical argument...

&gt;<i> I do not think it such sarcasm is appropriate. I
</I>&gt;<i> do not think it would be at all productive to answer such questions.
</I>
That depends on whether you want me to take your proposals seriously. 
If you do, you might want to take concerns raised about said proposals 
seriously.
