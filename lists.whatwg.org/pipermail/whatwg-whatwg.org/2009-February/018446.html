It seems like, in the short term at least, the &quot;worse is better&quot; 
solution to this problem is for content providers to provide links to 
resources at different quality levels, and allow users to choose the 
most appropriate resource based on their internet connection and their 
computer rather than having the computer try to work it out for them. 
Assuming that the majority of users use a relatively small number of 
sites with the resources to provide multiple-quality versions of their 
videos and use a small number of computing devices with roughly 
unchanging network conditions (I imagine this scenario applies to the 
majority of non-technical), they will quickly learn which versions of 
the media works best for them on each site. Therefore the burden of this 
simple approach on end users does not seem to be very high.

Given this, I would prefer automatic quality negotiation be deferred to 
  HTML6.
