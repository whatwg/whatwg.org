Then the scripts block. I explained this and showed this in examples.

If the script is deferred, it will wait for the stylesheet.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) want to load stylesheets later, (infoPanel example)

</I>&gt;<i> Put the styles later.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put the styles first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The stylesheet can be placed right before the script which depends on
it, right before closing body tag:

<A HREF="http://dhtmlkitchen.com/jstest/block/link-script-bottom.html">http://dhtmlkitchen.com/jstest/block/link-script-bottom.html</A>

and the result will &quot;work&quot; in Firefox. However, that does not works
consistently in a wide enough range of current browsers. Particularly,
Webkit and Opera will alert('loaded') before getting the stylesheet.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Example 1:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;link independent type=&quot;text/css&quot;  ...&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;script...&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want the browser to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) load my stylesheet and then immediately begin to load script in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put the script first with a defer or async attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have already explained why this is going to make the page
functionally inconsistent and hard to maintain across a set of
browsers where some browsers have support for defer and others do not.

The deferred &quot;alert&quot; external script will run first in  browsers that
ignore defer. In browsers that do not ignore defer, (Firefox 3.1 pre)
it will run last, after the stylesheet is loaded. Boris explained that
current Gecko behavior is that any stylesheet load started by parsing
a &lt;style&gt; or &lt;link&gt; tag will increment a counter on the script loader
object for that document.

This also explains why putting deferred scripts first will hurt
performance in both cases.

Putting deferred scripts first is a really bad idea.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Example 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;link defer type=&quot;text/css&quot; id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot; ...&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/head&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;script depends=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot;...&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want the browser to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) defer my linked stylesheet id=&quot;lateBoundCSS&quot; until content is rendered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) render content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) upon encountering the deferred script, check the depends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) upon finding Result(3) is &quot;lateBoundCSS&quot;, wait for that resource to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finish load before running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really think that makes sense. Why would you depend on just one
</I>&gt;<i> style sheet and not the others? What if the others change the styles of
</I>&gt;<i> the content you're dealing with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The other stylesheets would not include style information for
infoPanel. That would go in infoPanel.css. In the build, infoPanel.css
could combined with other stylesheets that did not need to be loaded
first, such as searchSuggest.css.

That was covered by the infoPanel example that I provided.

&gt;<i> You could do this, however, using a 'load' event listener on the &lt;link&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> (though the spec doesn't yet support that -- I'm trying to reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of stuff I do using progress events until progress events is
</I>&gt;<i> further along REC track), or, more simply, by just waiting for the
</I>&gt;<i> document-wide 'load' event (though that won't wait for just the style
</I>&gt;<i> sheet, it'll wait for everything).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A load event on link would fire when the link is done loading. When
you say &quot;the document-wide load event,&quot; I think you mean
window.onload. Waiting for that would offer no performance benefit. It
would hurt performance and user experience. As such, that does not
fulfill the case where a script depends on a stylesheet.

Ian, you have once again snipped what I wrote, taking things out of
context. Once again, I would like to ask that you please do not do
that.

What I wrote, prior to boris saying &quot;not sure what this example is&quot;:

|<i>  2) want to load stylesheets later, (infoPanel example)
</I>
Then Boris made his reply (above).

Then you suggested adding the script to the DOM. Boris already
explained that this will have a different effect in Gecko. The only
stylesheets that block scripts are ones that the parser knows about;
using createElement to build and insert a &lt;link&gt; nto the DOM won't
block script execution.

Does your advice work in any browser? I think that it does not, but I
would be interested to know.

</I>
In practice, some browses will run a script before a stylesheet loads.
The examples I have shown, Opera and Webkit indicate this behavior,
and can be seen in the title of the document &quot;bgColor = transparent&quot;.

Boris' idea would fit into depends as:-

depends=&quot;&quot;,

when depends is empty string, it indicates that the script depends on
nothing else.
