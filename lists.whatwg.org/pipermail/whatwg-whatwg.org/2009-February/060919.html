</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The time element was primarily designed to address use cases involving

</I>&gt;<i>dates by design, as it is not really meant for historical dates.
</I>
Yes; and it is that narrow approach with which I take issue.

&gt;<i>Probably the most historical dates that it would really be suitably
</I>&gt;<i>optimised for are people's birthdates,
</I>
Why? Why are those dates more worthy of being semantically marked-up
than, say, the date of the sailing of the Mayflower, of the birthdate of
Caesar?

[...]
&gt;<i>These issues have all been discussed before, either here in the whatwg
</I>&gt;<i>or on public-html, and so I won't go into great detail.
</I>
I did make a point of saying:

        I've read up on what prior discussion I can find on the list;
        but may have missed some. I'll be happy to have anything I've
        overlooked pointed out to me.

&gt;&gt;<i> First, though, I should like to make the observation that, while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>hCalendar  microformats are most commonly used to allow event details
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to be added  to calendar apps, and that that use case drove their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>development, they  should not be seen simply as a tool to that end. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>see them, and hope  that others do, as a way of adding semantic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>meaning to mark-up; and  that's how I view the &#8220;time&quot; element, too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Once we indicate that the  semantic meaning of a string of text is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>date, it's up to other people to  decide what they use that for &#8212; &quot;let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a thousand flowers bloom&quot;, as the  adage goes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think this is a philosophical difference in approach from that which
</I>&gt;<i>we used in developing the time element, and other features in HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>Semantics for the sake of semantics are not, and should not be, a
</I>&gt;<i>design goal.
</I>
I am not proposing semantics &quot;for the sake of semantics&quot;; I am showing
that the semantics are already deployed, and that once deployed, the
potential use cases are more varied than the current examples.

[...]
&gt;<i>While it may seem like a logical step to go from supporting those real
</I>&gt;<i>use cases, to supporting theoretical cases involving BCE dates, Julian
</I>&gt;<i>calendars, leap seconds and whatever else, this actually only ends up
</I>&gt;<i>introducing unnecessary complexity.
</I>
The use-cases I gave are not &quot;theoretical&quot;.

Is the complexity really &quot;unnecessary&quot;, or are we just putting off a
difficult piece of work?

&gt;&gt;<i> Use-cases for machine-readable date mark-up are many: as well as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>aforesaid calendar interactions, they can be used for sorting; for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>searching...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, but the question is, are any of the use cases involving historical
</I>&gt;<i>dates really worth addressing with the time element?  If so, what are
</I>&gt;<i>those use cases and why are they significant enough?
</I>
The uses cases are in the paragraph you only quote partially, above. I
think they are all worth addressing (indeed, I think it would be
foolhardy not to), and I'm not alone in thinking so. How do you propose
to measure their worth objectively?

&gt;&gt;<i> hCalendar microformats are already used to mark up imprecise dates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (&quot;June 1977&quot;; &quot;2009&quot;). ISO8601 already supports them. Why not HTML5?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Though care needs to be taken, it's even possible to mark up words like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8220;today&quot; with a precise date, if that's generated real-time, server-side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What are the use cases for marking up such imprecise dates?  Are people
</I>&gt;<i>using hCalendar for such purposes?
</I>
Yes, as I say in the text you quote; and on the sites I gave in my
introduction (and unambiguously supported by the hCalendar specification
and ISO8601). Use cases as above.

&gt;&gt;<i> The issue of non-Gregorian (chiefly Julian) dates is a vexing one
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>It is not the job of the HTML5 working group to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solve this problem; but I think the group should recognise that at some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point a solution must be forthcoming. One way to do so would be allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          &lt;time schema=&quot;[schema-name]&quot; datetime=&quot;[value]&quot;&gt;[date in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>plain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         text]&lt;/time&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Developing such a solution without having clear use cases and a good
</I>&gt;<i>explanation of why addressing those use cases is worthwhile, is not a
</I>&gt;<i>good use of our time.
</I>
Again, use cases have been given. Why do you feel that they are not
clear?

&gt;<i>Even more so because you're trying to make room for a hypothetical
</I>&gt;<i>solution of marking up Julian dates that doesn't yet exist.
</I>
No; I'm proposing a solution which allows non-Gregorian date schemas to
be used.

&gt;&gt;<i> As for BCE dates, they're already allowed in ISO 8601 (since there was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no year 0, the year 3 BCE is given as -0002 in ISO 8601). I see no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason why they should be disallowed in &lt;time&gt; elements in HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Because allowing them requires additional effort, such as changes to
</I>&gt;<i>the parsing requirements, for which there is little to nothing gained
</I>&gt;<i>in practice due to a lack of compelling use cases.
</I>
Again: why are the use cases given not acceptable to you?

&gt;&gt;<i> Coordinates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Another abuse of ABBR in microformats for coordinates:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          &lt;abbr class=&quot;geo&quot; title=&quot;52.548;-1.932&quot;&gt;Great Barr&lt;/abbr&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Bruce and I agree that this could be resolved, and HTML5 usefully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extended, by a &#8220;location&quot; element:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          &lt;location latitude=&quot;52.548&quot; longitude=&quot;-1.932&quot;&gt;Great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Barr&lt;/location&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not familiar with the use cases for the geolocation microformat,
</I>&gt;<i>nor am I aware if there even are any.  So I will not comment on this.
</I>
There are many million 'Geo' microformats published in the wild, with
support in several browsers/  plugins and on-line apps. Publishers
include Google, Wikipedia and Flickr:

        &lt;<A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-examples-in-wild">http://microformats.org/wiki/geo-examples-in-wild</A>&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> Using the &#8220;schema&quot; attribute shown above, for non-Gregorian dates, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can extend that for Martian, Lunar (and eventually other bodies):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          &lt;location schema=&quot;moon&quot; latitude=&quot;52.548&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         longitude=&quot;23.47297&quot;&gt;Sea of Tranquility&lt;/location&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What's the use case for this?  Why would most people need to mark up
</I>&gt;<i>lunar co-ordinates?
</I>
For example: to allow such points to be easily found on maps, or in
tools like Google Earth - the same as can be done presently for
terrestrial coordinates, using &quot;Geo&quot; microformats.

Also of note is that NASA plans to begin constructing a permanent
presence on the Moon (which will be referanceable by lunar coordinates;
as will each of the places which they will then explore) in 2019 -
that's three years before 2022 ;-)

&gt;<i>  Are astronomers really asking for such facilities to be included in
</I>&gt;<i>HTML?
</I>
The Astrogeology Team of the  U.S. Geological Survey have expressed
interest. But astronomers are far from the only publishers of such data.

&gt;<i>  Would we really be addressing their needs by doing so?
</I>
Apparently so.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now all we need to do is to work-around the abuse of ABBR for durations,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the draft hAudio microformat:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          &lt;abbr title=&quot;PT3M23S&quot;&gt;3 minutes 23 seconds&lt;/abbr&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What's the use case?
</I>
That was a light-hearted comment, but see, for example, the duration
properties in:

        &lt;<A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/haudio">http://microformats.org/wiki/haudio</A>&gt;
and:
        &lt;<A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe">http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe</A>&gt;

More seriously, a more widely-scoped &quot;measurement&quot; element, capable of
taking, for example, values of &quot;duration&quot;, &quot;length&quot;, &quot;mass&quot;,
&quot;temperature&quot;, etc.; and a value; and perhaps a schema (defaulting to
SI), would perhaps be more useful. Use cases are microformats, plus
translation, automated conversion, sorting, etc.
