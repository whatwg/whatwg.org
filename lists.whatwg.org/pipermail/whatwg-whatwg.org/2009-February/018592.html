</I>
The behavior specced now may change, but as it stands now unescaping is 
defined for fragment-identifier-to-id=&quot;&quot; matching.

In general, though, the behaviour is constrained by what IE does and more 
to the point by what is needed by content that depends on what IE does.

(You sent another couple of e-mails on the topic; I understand -- mostly 
-- the points you make therein, and would like to refer you to the recent 
thread on the topic:

   <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Feb/thread.html#msg407">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Feb/thread.html#msg407</A>

...where the same issues were discussed with more concrete reference to 
actual implementations and constraints placed on us by legacy content.)


&gt;<i> &gt; What terminology would you prefer rather than &quot;subtree&quot;? (We can't say 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document, since we are also trying to define conformance rules for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disconnected subtrees handled from scripts.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uhm, it may depend on what kinds of manipulations you have in mind, whether
</I>&gt;<i> the disconnected subtree must be anyway a whole document to fulfil the
</I>&gt;<i> uniqueness rule, and perhaps also on what the subtree concept might be turned
</I>&gt;<i> into by future DOM Core versions, so maybe just a clarification on what a
</I>&gt;<i> subtree is with respect to both the document (as a tree) and the scripts
</I>&gt;<i> handling possibilities might be enough, instead of searching a new
</I>&gt;<i> terminology, just to 'scope' the id visibility. I mean, if the ID matching is
</I>&gt;<i> relevant for scripts accessing the matching element through the
</I>&gt;<i> getElementById() method, actually a document tree is always overlapping the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of subtree, and a disconnected subtree must be a document without a
</I>&gt;<i> browsing context; otherwise, if other dom manipulations are involved the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of subtree may change, for instance a script might implement its own
</I>&gt;<i> scanning routine, treating an id attribute as any other attribute and leading
</I>&gt;<i> to the concept that any non-leaf node may be the root of a subtree (that is
</I>&gt;<i> identifying a subtree with any possible document fragment); furthermore, a
</I>&gt;<i> possible future version of DOM Core interfaces might move the getElementById
</I>&gt;<i> method to the Node interface, leading to the same result. Thus, a generic
</I>&gt;<i> definition of 'subtree' (or no definition, or a definition relying upon a
</I>&gt;<i> specific DOM feature or on script handling) might result in a variable concept
</I>&gt;<i> with a variable scope for the ID uniqueness, but might make sense in a working
</I>&gt;<i> draft until at least a first definition of the Web DOM Core specification, or
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for any reason arising to restrict or enlarge the concept; otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i> if that's been stated with a large consensus that a subtree is always a
</I>&gt;<i> document tree, the term might be changed into the expression &quot;a document, with
</I>&gt;<i> or without a browsing context&quot;, or (equivalently) be defined as &quot;a document
</I>&gt;<i> subtree having a node of type document as its root&quot; (to cover the case of
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically created documents). Otherwise, if a subtree can be either a whole
</I>&gt;<i> document, or a document subtree detached from its owner document (i.e. a node
</I>&gt;<i> removed from a document with its descendants, or a tree of nodes whose
</I>&gt;<i> ownerDocument property is not defined or null), it might be defined just as
</I>&gt;<i> such, leaving the term 'subtree' wherever it is now (but would such a
</I>&gt;<i> manipulation be consistent with the - authoring - uniqueness rule when the
</I>&gt;<i> subtree is inserted into an actual document?).
</I>
My brain got lost partway through reading the above, so I apologise if I 
missed a key point you were making.

Anyway, the spec now has the term &quot;home subtree&quot;, which is defined in more 
detail than &quot;subtree&quot; was before. I hope this helps.

</I>
Note that pages that rely on this behaviour (either in the linking or the 
targetting) are non-conforming.

There are pages that depend on weird behavior here, as noted in the thread 
I mentioned near the top of this e-mail, but it may be that we can change 
the actual rules a bit to handle this better.


&gt;<i> Getting to the problem mentioned here, the robustness principle says 
</I>&gt;<i> that id=&quot;foo bar&quot; should be accepted, but nevertheless invalid - because 
</I>&gt;<i> a fragment with a space can never be part of an URI. So IMHO, any 
</I>&gt;<i> program should strive to accept broken URIs if they are unambigous 
</I>&gt;<i> (which they are here, because the address can hold only one URI at a 
</I>&gt;<i> time), but never output them.
</I>
Agreed.
