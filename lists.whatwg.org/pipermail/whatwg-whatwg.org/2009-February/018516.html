Well, I don't know what to tell you. Latest version of Chrome is still giving me a Date object. I don't know what version of WebKit it's using.

&gt;<i> More to the point, there's also a false premise in the specification's

</I>&gt;<i> down to a double for its internal representation; I believe that's by

</I>&gt;<i> claim that a number, also a double, can't handle the entire range of

</I>&gt;<i> someone can give a specific example with details of how this would go

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The DOM 3 Core actually says that an &quot;integer type&quot; in ECMAScript is too small. The ECMA-262 spec doesn't say anything about an &quot;integer&quot; type; all numbers are doubles, so I have no idea what the DOM spec is referring to. However, note that section 15.9.1.1 of ECMA-262 does says that the valid range for a Date object is slightly smaller than that representable by a double (8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds on either side of epoch, instead of 9,007,199,254,740,991), so there is a slight difference between returning a number and returning a Date. However, in practice it's unlikely those scenarios will be hit.

Cheers,
