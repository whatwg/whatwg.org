Right.

</I>
Well the spec says &quot;If the absolute URL identified by the cite attribute 
is being shown to the user, or if any data derived from that URL is 
affecting the display&quot;, which basically means that for most browsers 
there's no issue here, no?

I don't really follow. if you are proposing a change to the spec, could 
you elaborate on what exactly the change you propose is?
