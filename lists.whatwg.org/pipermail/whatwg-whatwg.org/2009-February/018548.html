There are three of these attributes so far:

  autocomplete = on/off
  contenteditable = true/false
  draggable = true/false

I used true/false for spellcheck since it had slightly more other 
attributes doing the same thing.

Also, it's been implemented twice now, so using other keywords is a 
problem.


&gt;<i> 2. Check the spelling of the passage (&quot;asits&quot;!) :0)

Fixed.


&gt;<i> 3. Say that the default behavior for BODY is &quot;on&quot; and the default behavior
</I>&gt;<i> for INPUT[type=text] is &quot;off&quot;.
</I>
The default behavior is user-agent-dependent. This is intentional since 
different users may have different needs.

Correct.

Based on the above feedback, I have left the spec as-is, allowing both 
behaviors (&quot;User agents may use the language of the element to determine 
what spelling and grammar rules to use, or may use the user's preferred 
language settings&quot;).
