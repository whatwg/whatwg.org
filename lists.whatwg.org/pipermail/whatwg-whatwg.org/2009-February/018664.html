Apologies in advance if this covers old ground, it appears I missed some 
e-mails in the last round of e-mails about this topic.

[snip more discussion back and forth about whether it's a good idea or 
not, or whether we could come up with some heuristics for it instead]

Based on the interest (not uniform interest, but interest nonetheless) on 
this topic, I've left the feature in the spec.

I don't think that heuristics would work -- in practice, little 
distinguishes the subject line from the To: line in GMail, for instance, 
but one wants spell checking and the other does not.

Yeah, it's certainly not the simplest thing that could have been invented, 
I'll give you that.


&gt;<i> First, it allows spellchecking to be explicitly turned on, potentially 
</I>&gt;<i> overriding normal defaults, but that seems wrong; an &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;email&quot;&gt; should never spellcheck regardless of the page author 
</I>&gt;<i> says.
</I>
The user agent is allowed to override the author here, if desired.

The applicability to &lt;input type=email&gt; fields is mostly just a 
side-effect of the attribute applying to everything, which is because we 
want it to apply to contentEditable. The &quot;true&quot; state is so that subparts 
of contentEditable fields can have checking enabled when outer parts have 
it disabled.


&gt;<i> I can't see any valid use case for the author turning spellchecking on 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of UA defaults or user preferences. Second, it allows 
</I>&gt;<i> spellchecking to be controlled at a finer granularity than editability, 
</I>&gt;<i> for which again I think there is no valid use case. Both of these 
</I>&gt;<i> aspects make the feature more complicated to implement and harder to 
</I>&gt;<i> understand, compared to just having a way to only disable spellchecking 
</I>&gt;<i> at the same granularity as editing.
</I>
In contentEditable, it's easy to imagine that some parts shouldn't be 
spellchecked when others should, e.g. the editor might introduce a URL and 
not want that checked.

It's consistent with contentEditable, which it's intended to be used with.


&gt;<i> IMHO it should be nospellcheck=&quot;nospellcheck&quot; (which also solves problem 
</I>&gt;<i> of forcing spellchecking where it doesn't make sense).
</I>
That's a pretty ugly attribute name, though.

BeSpin, for instance, might want this, if they ever switch from &lt;canvas&gt; 
to contentEditable.

I agree that it seems a bit overpowerful. Experience from Gecko suggests 
it's not all that bad though.

Consistency with contenteditable seems a worthy goal worth the price of 
this minor inconsistency, IMHO.
