In &quot;standalone&quot; mode, a Web application can pretend to be a Web browser, 
tricking the user into thinking they are visiting a site they are not in 
fact visiting, and thus executing a remarkably authentic-looking phishing 
attack. That is why it needs an explicit opt-in.


&gt;<i> &gt; Dock badging could be equally made available safely, IMHO. The main 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason I haven't made dock badging available so far is that it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really make sense for most environments -- in fact as far as I know 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only Mac OS X has this feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great to know. Prism has code that allows &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;command&gt; elements 
</I>&gt;<i> to be used to add menuitems to the Dock (Trayicon on Windows) menu as 
</I>&gt;<i> well. We could even support something like &lt;menu type=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;...&lt;/menu&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> for this too. Ignored by UAs that don't support it.
</I>
Yes, this is one of the things I'm interested in exploring once &lt;menu&gt; and 
&lt;command&gt; (as specified today) are implemented. (Another is introducing a 
command=&quot;&quot; attribute to make it possible to define command state once 
and have UI widgets reflect that state automatically.)


&gt;<i> I am suggesting that an explicit &quot;push to make a standalone app&quot; button 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't needed. Any webapp is already able to run standalone. _If_ there 
</I>&gt;<i> is some reason, for security or code privilege, that an explicit action 
</I>&gt;<i> or confirmation is needed on the part of the user, such confirmation 
</I>&gt;<i> should be enforced at the point of execution, when the user attempts to 
</I>&gt;<i> do something that might be dangerous.
</I>
It's unclear how that would work. Confirmations in general are known to 
not work, for instance (users click through anything).
