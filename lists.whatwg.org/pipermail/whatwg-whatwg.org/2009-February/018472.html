</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You wouldn't want all the :disabled fields to suddenly say &quot;read-only&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    :not(:disabled):read-only { ... }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...every time you wanted to style the fields which, when enabled, still 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't be edited.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll see if I can get Selectors updated.

</I>
It turns out this is (now?) only in CSS3 UI, which doesn't have a 
maintainer right now.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There is a clear double standard here. I had a problem with the way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; :read-only was defined, that it applied to elements that did not have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; |readonly| attribute, but you made it clear that I would have to go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; through www-style to get it changes in the CSS3-UI specification before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; getting a related change made in the WF2 spec.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, :read-only has always been intended to apply to everything. There's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a difference between the basic concept of the pseudo-class and the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definiton of the pseudo-class.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    That's the point. The :read-only pseudo-class should never have been
</I>&gt;<i> defined as applying to everything. It should apply to markup that has a
</I>&gt;<i> defined read-only state. The text-based input of a control is not
</I>&gt;<i> comparable to a |contenteditable| region of HTML. For instance, if you
</I>&gt;<i> can't edit the markup of an &lt;input&gt; element, but you can edit the text
</I>&gt;<i> in the control, then at the markup level, the control is read-only, but
</I>&gt;<i> the actual control contents are read-write. Conversely, what if you have
</I>&gt;<i> an &lt;input readonly&gt; control as the child of an element with
</I>&gt;<i> |contenteditable| enabled? In this case, the markup actual says
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;readonly&quot;, but it might still be considered read-write because the
</I>&gt;<i> markup can be changed.
</I>
I agree that I was applying a double standard here (I am following CSS3 
UI when it comes to it saying that :read-only applies to everything, and 
not following it when it comes to saying that :read-write doesn't apply 
to disabled controls).

I've made HTML5 say that :read-write doesn't apply to disabled controls.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yet when you have a problem with the definition of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; _EXACT_SAME_PSEUDO-CLASS_, you just change the WF2 spec to produce 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; orthogonally where none existed in the collective W3C specs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Perhaps you can explain to me how you justify this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm trying to make the specs be useful to authors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Having to style control elements using selectors like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;html|input[readonly]&quot; as opposed to &quot;:readonly&quot; doesn't strike me as
</I>&gt;<i> more useful for authors. Also, note that for stuff like XForms, you can
</I>&gt;<i> end up in a situation where there's no clear way of styling a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;read-only&quot; control, since the &quot;read-only&quot; property may not exist
</I>&gt;<i> directly on the element. Of course, if we start talking about other XML
</I>&gt;<i> languages here, we're getting off topic...
</I>
Yeah. I'm not really sure what to do about this.
