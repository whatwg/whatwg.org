I agree, and am optimistic that improvements can be made.

Defer is not widely implemented. Opera and Webkit today will run a
script before a stylesheet loads. Allowing the author to provide
information about what a script depends on (or doesn't) would not
break functionality in those cases (where such functionality is
already &quot;broken&quot;).

&lt;script depends=&quot;&quot; ...

when depends is empty string, the script depends on nothing else.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ah, that is one thing that Gecko does do: we don't start _layout_ (as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opposed to parsing) until all the stylesheets in &lt;head&gt; have loaded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For Firefox 3.0, IMG and SCRIPT that are part of the body are fetched
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around this time. They are not fetched prior. Why not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because you have &lt;script&gt;s after your stylesheets, not just stylesheets.
</I>&gt;<i>  Really, controlled experiments are hard.  You have to hold all but one
</I>&gt;<i> variable constant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, I modified the example:

<A HREF="http://localhost/jstest/block/link-img-noscript.html">http://localhost/jstest/block/link-img-noscript.html</A>

The bottom script will not load ('load' as opposed to 'run') in
Firefox/3.0.6 until after 5 seconds.

</I>+-------------------------+-------------------------------+
(table to be viewed in a monospace font)

The result shows that example.js loads 5 seconds after the initial
page load. example.js waits for the stylesheet to load.
Not the case in 3.1; what you are arguing is true there.

&gt;&gt;<i> In that case, the link would not block layout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, which is why you get a performance hit when it loads.  But I thought we
</I>&gt;<i> were talking about stylesheets that don't &quot;really&quot; affect layout
</I>&gt;<i> (late-loading stylesheets, which you wanted).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Late-loading stylesheets would improve load time.

My concern is with the recomputation you mentioned. Can you elaborate
on that, or point me to a webpage that explains it?

&gt;&gt;<i> In &quot;Shiretoko&quot; 1.9.1b3pre, a deferred script waits for all stylesheets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to load before running. However, this is not guaranteed behavior in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any standard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.  At least not yet.  I suspect it's pretty much required for web
</I>&gt;<i> compat, though, which is why it's implemented that way.  Or at the very
</I>&gt;<i> least the scripts need to wait for the stylesheets that came before them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would disagree with that on the basis that defer is not widely supported.

Question: What does IE do?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Question: When the stylesheet is eventually applied, could the reflow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be optimized for performance?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not easily, no.  Or rather, the reflow already is; the style data
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> recomputation is the hard part.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would make it easier? I'd really like to know how to design my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pages so that they are faster and more responsive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, one option is to stop worrying about micromanaging the load order and
</I>&gt;<i> assume that speculative parsing will solve your problems.... will it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Possibly. If the author could declare what a script depends on and let
the implementation determine what to load and when, would that be too
complicated?


&gt;&gt;<i> A deferred stylesheet being requested by the browser would not be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem. Mozilla already makes predictive fetches for links. However,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if a deferred stylesheet is fetched during loading, should that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stylesheet (and rules.length, etc) be accessible via script in that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time? Should the deferred link fire a load event after the request
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion, prefetching should have no effect on what the DOM sees. It
</I>&gt;<i> should just make it look like the network load took a lot less time than it
</I>&gt;<i> would otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, you load the stylesheet, parse it, whatever, but don't hook
</I>&gt;<i> it up to the document until you &quot;really&quot; parse the &lt;link&gt; tag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That makes sense.
