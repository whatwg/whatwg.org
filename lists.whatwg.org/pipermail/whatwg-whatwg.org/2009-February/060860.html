</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problem definition: a malicious page in domain A may create an IFRAME

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authenticated with cookies. The top-level page may then cover portions 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the IFRAME with other visual elements to seamlessly hide everything 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but a single UI button in domain B, such as &quot;delete all items&quot;, &quot;click 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to add Bob as a friend&quot;, etc. It may then provide own, misleading UI 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that implies that the button serves a different purpose and is a part of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site A, inviting the user to click it. Although the examples above are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> naive, this is clearly a problem for a good number of modern, complex 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> web applications.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Proposed fixes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Create a HTTP-level (or HTTP-EQUIV) mechanism along the lines of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &quot;X-I-Do-Not-Want-To-Be-Framed-Across-Domains: yes&quot; that permits a web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    page to inhibit frame rendering in potentially dangerous situations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Pros:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Super-simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Cons:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - &quot;Opt-in&quot;, i.e. currently vulnerable sites remain vulnerable unless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      action is taken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Can't be used for cases where IFRAME content mixing has a legitimate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      purpose (for example, cross-domain gadgets, certain types of mashups)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular, this breaks Image Search tools from various vendors as well 
</I>&gt;<i> as navigation aids like the Reddit toolbar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Adds yet another security measure (along with cross-domain XHR, MSIE8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      XSS filters, MSIE P3P cookie behavior, Mozilla security policies)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      that needs to be employed correctly everywhere to work - which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      very unlikely to consistently happen in practice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Along with the aforementioned security features, threatens to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      result in HTTP header or HTML HTTP-EQUIV size bloat that some sites
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      may care about.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This solution is what IE8 has apparently chosen to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, IE8 will recognise an HTTP header or &lt;meta&gt; pragma directive 
</I>&gt;<i> with the name &quot;X-Frame-Options&quot;, and will process it as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If the value is a case-insensitive match for &quot;deny&quot; and the browsing 
</I>&gt;<i>    context being navigated is not a top-level browsing context, replace 
</I>&gt;<i>    the document with a UA-defined error message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If the value is a case-insensitive match for &quot;sameorigin&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i>    browsing context being navigated is not a top-level browsing context 
</I>&gt;<i>    and the origin of the top-level browsing context is not the same as the 
</I>&gt;<i>    origin of the document in question, replace the document with a 
</I>&gt;<i>    UA-defined error message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The &quot;sameorigin&quot; rule seems like it should check all ancestor browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> contexts, not just the top-level one, because otherwise a site X, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> images.google.com, showing a frame with a document on site Y, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> hostile.example.com -- which might happen e.g. on something like Google 
</I>&gt;<i> Image Search -- would be able to embed another page from site X, e.g. your 
</I>&gt;<i> image search preferences, and do clickjacking on it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This feature could also be extended to apply to other resources, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, images, style sheets, fonts, to prevent them from being used 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-origin. This would help, e.g., with securing scripts that contain 
</I>&gt;<i> private data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Add a document-level mechanism to make &quot;if nested &lt;show this&gt; else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;show that&gt;&quot; conditionals possible without Javascript. One proposal is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    to do this on the level of CSS (by using either the media-dependency
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    features of CSS or special classes); another is to introduce new HTML
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    tags. This would make it possible for pages to defend themselves even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    in environments where Javascript is disabled or limited.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an interesting idea, though it would be subsumed by Hallvord's 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion with Origin given below, in conjunction with idea 1 above in 
</I>&gt;<i> the absence of Origin information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Add an on-by-default mechanism that prevents UI actions to be taken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    when a document tries to obstruct portions of a non-same-origin frame.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    By carefully designing the mechanism, we can prevent legitimate uses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (such as dynamic menus that overlap with advertisements, gadgets, etc)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    from being affected, yet achieve a high reliability in stopping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    attacks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems difficult to get right in practice, and browser vendors seem 
</I>&gt;<i> reluctant to go down this road.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Enforce a click-to-work mechanism (resembling the Eolas patent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    workaround) for all cross-domain IFRAMEs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Experience with the Eolas patent workaround suggests this wouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> popular, to put in mildly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Rework everything we know about HTML / browser security models to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    make it possible for domains and pages to specify very specific opt-in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    / opt-out policies for all types of linking, referencing, such that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    countering UI redress attacks would be just one of the cases controlled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    by this mechanism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like it would still basically need one of the other mechanisms 
</I>&gt;<i> as well. Without a more concrete proposal here it's hard to tell what 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly this would be.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6) New cookie attribute: The &quot;httpOnly&quot; cookie flag allows sites to put 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restrictions on how a cookie can be accessed. We could allow a new flag 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be specified in the Set-Cookie header that is designed to prevent 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CSRF and &quot;UI redress&quot; attacks. If a cookie is set with a &quot;sameOrigin&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flag, we could prevent that cookie from being sent on HTTP requests that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are initiated by other origins, or were made by frames with ancestors of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other origins. In a CSRF or &quot;UI redress&quot; attack scenario, it will appear 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as though the user is not logged in, and thus the HTTP request will be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unable to affect the user's account.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an interesting idea, though it only works for Cookie- 
</I>&gt;<i> authenticated content (admittedly that is most content). I recommend 
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting this to the group currently speccing httpOnly. It seems out of 
</I>&gt;<i> scope for HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7) New HTTP request header: Browser vendors seem to be moving away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from &quot;same origin restrictions&quot; towards &quot;verifiable origin labels&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that let the site decide whether two security origins trust each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other.  Recent examples of this are MessageEvent's &quot;origin&quot; property
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [1], postMessage's &quot;targetOrigin&quot; argument [2], and the HTTP &quot;Origin&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> header [3] [4] [5]. We can adjust proposal (1) to conform to this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> philosophy: instead of making it an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;X-I-Do-Not-Want-To-Be-Framed-Across-Domains: yes&quot; HTTP response
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> header, make it an &quot;X-Ancestor-Frame-Origin: <A HREF="http://www.evil.com">http://www.evil.com</A>&quot; HTTP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request header. This header could be a list of all the origins that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are ancestors of the frame that triggered the request. If the site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decides it does not like the ancestor frame origin it could reject the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request. This could be added as a property of MessageEvent as well to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detect client-side-only UI redress attacks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could be considered an extension to suggestion 1.
