</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you think about various syntax variants of wiki systems they&#8217;ve got one thing in common that makes them preferable to direct HTML input: easy links! (Local ones at least, whatever that means.) The best known example is probably double square brackets as in Mediawiki, the engine that powers the Wikimediaverse. A link to another article on the same wiki is as simple as &#8220;[[Foo]]&#8221;, where HTML would have needed &#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;Foo&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;&#8221;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder whether HTML could and should provide some sort of similar shortening, i.e. &#8220;&lt;a href&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; or even, just maybe, &#8220;&lt;a&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;&#8221;. The UA would append the string content, properly encoded, to the base Web address as the hyperlink&#8217;s target, thus behave as had it encounters &#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;Foo&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/a&gt;&#8221;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I prefer the binary toggle role of the &#8216;href&#8217; attribute, although it doesn&#8217;t work well in the XML serialisation, because it provides better compatibility with existing content and when I see or write &#8220;&lt;a&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; I rather think of the origin of that element name, &#8216;anchor&#8217;. So I expect it to be equivalent to &#8220;&lt;a id&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; and &#8220;&lt;a name&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; which would be shortcuts for &#8220;&lt;a id=&quot;Bar&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;&#8221;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS: Square brackets aren&#8217;t that simple actually, because on many keyboard layouts they&#8217;re not easy to input and might not be found on keytops at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PPS: The serialisation difference is not that important, because XML, unlike HTML, isn&#8217;t intended to be written by hand anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Can't this be handled with CSS' generated content? I'm not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be getting the syntax right, but I think something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a[href]:empty { content: attr(href); }
</I>&gt;<i> would pull the href from every empty&lt;a&gt;  that has such attribute (so
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't mess with anchor-only elements) and render it as the
</I>&gt;<i> content of the element. Note that href attributes are resolved
</I>&gt;<i> relative to what your&lt;base&gt;s define (this is slightly better than
</I>&gt;<i> just &quot;appending&quot;, since it makes '../whatever'-style URLs work the
</I>&gt;<i> right way), so you don't need to (rather, should not) use absolute
</I>&gt;<i> URLs for such links.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that you are only concerned about avoiding duplication of
</I>&gt;<i> content for the href and the content of the element. Your proposal
</I>&gt;<i> puts the stuff on the content, while the CSS-based solution would put
</I>&gt;<i> it on the href; but both put it only once.
</I>While it is a creative solution, something as basic as content of an 
href should not depend on CSS... CSS content is supposed to be reserved 
for decorative content.

I for one like the abbreviated syntax; a lot of times one does wish to 
make the link visible. I imagine the web would be full of such links.

Abbreviating to &lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't work as an abbrev for &lt;a href&gt; as 
the former is still used for anchors.
