I'm not sure of a better venue off-hand.  I don't think that there's
anyone from Microsoft participating in this list, though, and I expect
that a lot of the users affected by the Facebook viruses are using
their browser.

&gt;&gt;<i> Would a UA that asked for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user's permission the first time a bookmarklet is used (like some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prompt the first time a given helper app or URL scheme is used) be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean like Windows User Account Control? ;)
</I>
No, I mean like the prompts for geolocation, popup windows, first-use
helper applications, first-use URL protocols, and similar.  But my
question is more about what you propose to disallow, and why you
choose &quot;disable&quot; as the requirement.

&gt;<i> It's not unreasonable to guess that the number of people
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenienced by the easy exploitability of the current behavior
</I>&gt;<i> numbers in the millions, given that Facebook has 500M users and these
</I>&gt;<i> viruses continue to spread like wildfire. &#160;The number inconvenienced
</I>&gt;<i> by having these URLs disabled by default (and re-enableable via a
</I>&gt;<i> developer option the first time they hit this limitation)
</I>
That is only helpful against the specific case of direct paste in the
URL bar, though, and bookmarklets aren't just a developer-only
feature.  They're widely used by URL-shortening services, blogging and
micro-blogging services, and Amazon's universal wish list.

&gt;<i> Given the success of these exploits so far, it is also reasonable to
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that the sophistication of attack will only increase with
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
Yes, which I think is why so many of us are suggesting that making the
social engineer say &quot;drag this link to your bookmark bar, and use it
when you Really Like something!&quot; is not going to be much of a
mitigation.

It's not that I don't believe it's a problem, to be clear; it's that I
don't think you're proposing a meaningful solution to it!
