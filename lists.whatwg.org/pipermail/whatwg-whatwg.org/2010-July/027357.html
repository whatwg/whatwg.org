</I>&gt;<i> user to resize the image (which is a horrible experience) or they resize 
</I>&gt;<i> the image on the client using gears (with workers and canvas) or flash, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc. (or canvas but for more than one browser that may hang the UI).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Similarly Gmail now allows dragging images into email

</I>&gt;<i> The full resolution image isn't necessary for this. It would be better

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Something like Google Docs or Wave which show real time participation

</I>&gt;<i> inserted image to other people in the conversation. (One could envision 
</I>&gt;<i> this for any real time chat/communication website.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - When you upload photos to picasaweb from the Picasa client, it offers 
</I>&gt;<i> to resize them to 1600X1200 before uploading them. Also, it offers an 
</I>&gt;<i> option to upload a thumbnail first before uploading the bigger picture, 
</I>&gt;<i> so the album can appear even quicker (just at a really low resolution). 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, a website could do something similar.

The logical conclusion is that we should make one of the following choices:

 1. Provide dedicated asynchronous APIs for this use case.
    For example, a method to go from an image URL to a Blob representing 
    that image at a different size and/or rotation.

 2. Provide generic APIs for that can handle this use case amongst others.
    For example, porting the 2D canvas API to workers.

 3. Not address this use case (yet).

For #1, my preference would be to add two methods to &lt;img&gt;, one to make 
&lt;img&gt; resize and rotate the image and then fire 'load' again, and one to 
obtain the current image as a Blob, much like toDataURL() on &lt;canvas&gt; 
(where a similar toBlob() would also be useful).

For #2, we'd need to provide an Image object (a non-DOM version of 
HTMLImageElement) and a Canvas object (a non-DOM version of 
HTMLCanvasElement) in workers.

But unless we have a critical mass of browser vendors agreed on one of 
these approaches, we have to default to #3. Currently it seems only the 
Chrome team is especially interested in either #1 or #2.

My recommendation, in the absence of enthusiasm from other browser 
vendors, would be for the Chrome team to experiment with #1 or #2. If I 
have misread the current situation and there is a willingness to implement 
#1 or #2 in more browsers, then please let me know. I'd be happy to spec 
one of those options. (#1 would be easy to do; #2 might take longer, since 
it is significantly more work.)
