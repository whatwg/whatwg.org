&gt;<i> &gt; As several people pointed out (and which I tried to get at in my post),
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is really an ecosystem issue rather than a change needed in the spec or
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsers.  I suspect it's going to take some time, but the flexibility of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; embedding content via &lt;iframe&gt; will be a big step forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be straightforward for YouTube to offer &lt;iframe&gt; support
</I>&gt;<i> right now, in addition to &lt;object&gt;?  The backend support should be
</I>&gt;<i> simple to do.  If you keep the &lt;object&gt; code as the default embed
</I>&gt;<i> recommendation and hide the &lt;iframe&gt; embed code somewhere so people
</I>&gt;<i> will only use it if they look for it, you won't risk confusing anyone.
</I>&gt;<i>  Sites that currently whitelist &lt;object&gt; from YouTube will eventually
</I>&gt;<i> whitelist &lt;iframe&gt; from YouTube too -- I hope there aren't many sites
</I>&gt;<i> that permit *arbitrary* &lt;object&gt;s to be inserted by untrusted users.
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing &lt;iframe&gt; will have other benefits, like allowing fallback
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;install Flash&quot; content (currently omitted from the &lt;object&gt; code, I
</I>&gt;<i> assume to keep the size down).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, it's pretty straightforward to offer &lt;iframe&gt;-based embed code, but it
needs to be coupled with getting sites to accept them, or we end up with a
lot of confused, unhappy users.  Note that sites don't generally whitelist
specific SWFs - they generally allow all Flash embeds.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing that occurs to me is that you might show HTML5 video
</I>&gt;<i> when Flash isn't installed/enabled, or when the Flash player crashes.
</I>&gt;<i> Or at least you could give an option, instead of just failing silently
</I>&gt;<i> (for embeds) or saying the user should install Flash (on the site
</I>&gt;<i> itself).  My primary machine runs Linux, and Flash usually doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work at all.  If I didn't know about the HTML5 beta, I wouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use YouTube at all.  And as it is, I can't use any YouTube
</I>&gt;<i> embeds most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, this is the main point of using an &lt;iframe&gt; to embed code - it allows
the site providing embeddable content to tailor the presentation to the
user/device/context at runtime, rather than requiring the presentation to be
fixed up-front.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When limiting keyboard input, I'd suggest devices w/ onscreen keyboards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply disable the keyboard.  Applications that work well with touch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interfaces generally provide gesture alternatives for the limited set of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keys that would be available.  Alternately, devices could limit the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the set of allowed keys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is if the program makes a fake keyboard and then directly
</I>&gt;<i> intercepts touch events to that location, without invoking the OS's
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard at all.  The user won't be able to tell that the keypresses
</I>&gt;<i> are going to the website instead of the OS.  But I can't see this as
</I>&gt;<i> being a big issue -- screen space is so limited on these devices that
</I>&gt;<i> websites are fullscreen anyway, or practically.  On my Nexus One,
</I>&gt;<i> unless you're scrolled to the top of the site, websites take up the
</I>&gt;<i> whole screen except for the bar at the top, which is present in all
</I>&gt;<i> apps.  So they could already trivially spoof any application, if they
</I>&gt;<i> know the target platform.  Not if the user presses the menu button, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, I realized that loophole after I sent the mail.  The same
vulnerability is there if fullscreen is initiated by a control the browser
chrome, though - at the end of the day, the primary problem to solve is
ensuring that users understand they're still viewing a web page, and the
contents are provided by the web page rather than the OS.



&gt;<i> &gt; As pointed out, this is not strictly an issue for &lt;video&gt; tag, though
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly related especially for local preview.  I have not been closely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following the work on the &lt;device&gt; element, though that seems to be where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is headed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;device&gt; adoption shouldn't interfere with &lt;video&gt; adoption, though.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if YouTube switched to &lt;video&gt; by default, it could keep Flash
</I>&gt;<i> for recording until &lt;device&gt; was implemented.  It's probably best for
</I>&gt;<i> implementers to focus on perfecting &lt;video&gt; (and maybe &lt;canvas&gt;, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> before they put too much work into &lt;device&gt;, since those are much
</I>&gt;<i> bigger use-cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're absolutely right, and I think the order things are going is correct -
&lt;video&gt; is more important than &lt;device&gt;
