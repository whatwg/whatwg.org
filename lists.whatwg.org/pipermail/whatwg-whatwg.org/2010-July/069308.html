</I>&gt;<i> key
</I>&gt;<i> seconds of the video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A friend of mine called this weekend to confirm that a scene in Back to  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> Future 3 that has been popping up online was actually in the movie and  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> just some Internet hoax.  He called to have me watch a particular  
</I>&gt;<i> segment on
</I>&gt;<i> the DVD.  I watched all of 3 minutes of the movie to confirm the original
</I>&gt;<i> scene contents.  Doc Brown's young blond haired train companion (who only
</I>&gt;<i> appears at the end of the movie) displays a very preverse set of  
</I>&gt;<i> gestures in
</I>&gt;<i> his 10 seconds of screen time that should have been edited out (I dodged  
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> spoilers).  There is a market for this kind of viewing habit that does  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> insist on the consumer purchasing a full right/license to the entire  
</I>&gt;<i> video
</I>&gt;<i> nor the bandwidth or storage to accommodate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you are selling adult content - many users are much happier to pay  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> a few minutes of content that they seek through rather than a full movie
</I>&gt;<i> that they will have little interest in watching again.  The difference  
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> easily be $.16 versus $16.  As for trailers, many of our plans include
</I>&gt;<i> additional time and all users that have ever purchased get 3 free 30  
</I>&gt;<i> second
</I>&gt;<i> plays weekly.  That being said, I don't think the business models of one  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the largest online video markets should put be on trial through a by a
</I>&gt;<i> standards list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the discussion that DRM is irrelevant has its merits, but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contracts and services at play have a real value regardless of how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution is restricted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the technology providers shouldn't feel an obligation to cater  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular contract models--especially when it complicates the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It makes more sense to draft contracts that are reasonable given the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology. (An example of a contract that I think technology providers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't attempt to cater for is a content licensing contract that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tries to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distinguish between desktops, mobile devices and TVs. Such a contract  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no sense when devices of any kind can support the same standards.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think providers cater to the technology that's available.  At the time
</I>&gt;<i> these contracts were drawn up Windows Media player and Real were leading  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> streaming video market.  The contracts and services in place now were
</I>&gt;<i> created pre-Youtube, when most users accessed the site with a 56 modem or
</I>&gt;<i> less.  The service was geared toward online streaming and streaming  
</I>&gt;<i> rentals
</I>&gt;<i> rather than downloads - which could take some users days to complete - or
</I>&gt;<i> longer when coupled with bad re-try behaviors in browsers.  Cell phones
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't play let alone download a video over their 14kbps connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For my purposes I am interested in application-controlled video  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delivery.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I want to be able to deliver unprotected mp4, webm, or ogv content in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> metered way.  If the user has payed to watch the entire video once and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> managed to work around HTTP no-cache and the other constraints that a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> normal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser viewed experience would have, then they will have succeeding in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloading a copy of the video - a task which they could have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accomplished
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a VM session or through other means regardless of DRM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the customers pay for seeing an entire title, why is it a problem if  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customer once in a while downloads the bytes twice? Surely it is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simpler to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bake the average bandwidth cost into the price and not complicate the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the delivery technology behaves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have different plans available.  Some allow a user to stream a chosen
</I>&gt;<i> video as often as they want.  There are plans that allow users to stream  
</I>&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;<i> entire studios selection of videos on demand.  This likens the service  
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> monthly membership site and the company I work for has found that many  
</I>&gt;<i> users
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to not have that sort of commitment - preferring instead to pay  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> what they watch when they watch it. The choice is determined by the  
</I>&gt;<i> content
</I>&gt;<i> provider and the user - we accomodate both parties to the best of our
</I>&gt;<i> ability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; These requests can be seen as generally allowing servers to reduce  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for video or large file downloads.  Since a client may be able to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> download 5
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minutes of video in under a minute I would like to see the client  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disconnect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the server and reconnect in 5 minutes to get the additional  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wouldn't this be a non-problem if the customers paid by title? In that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case, it would seem pointless to worry about the content getting  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloaded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster than it is played.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that your problem is picking a pricing model that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unnatural for the technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Partial requests are native to HTTP and seeking is natural for a healthy
</I>&gt;<i> streamed viewing habit - I'm look for a way to get the browser to take  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> servers recommendation that the content be fetched in a particular way -  
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> have content negotiation of transfer encoding and image quality, why not
</I>&gt;<i> allow the server to negotiate the transfer size for the benefit of the  
</I>&gt;<i> user
</I>&gt;<i> and the server?
</I>
Is preload=&quot;none&quot; not enough? I can't imagine the actual bandwidth savings  
of more fine-grained control to be significant, probably any attempt by  
the browser to stop buffering after some time is good enough.
