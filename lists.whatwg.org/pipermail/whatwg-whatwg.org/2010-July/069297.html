&gt;<i> The company I work for, VOD.com (sfw) (aka Hotmovies .com and clips .com -
</I>&gt;<i> nsfw (spaces added)), offer video on demand services to thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> studios.  Our sites are central locations for customers who want to watch
</I>&gt;<i> something - this is a service in itself.  We handle encoding and content
</I>&gt;<i> distribution and streaming sales for these studios without any cost to them.
</I>&gt;<i> They send us video content and we send them a monthly check. Without
</I>&gt;<i> services like the ones we provide many of these studios (some are mom and
</I>&gt;<i> pop shops) wouldn't otherwise have the ability to sell their content online
</I>&gt;<i> in this fashion.
</I>If I understand correctly, you are content distributors and video encoders.

&gt;<i> Customers can watch movies by purchasing packages of time or paying for DRM
</I>&gt;<i> protected rentals or for some of our sites and videos they can pay for
</I>&gt;<i> unprotected video.  The protected content (rentals) comes in the form of WMV
</I>&gt;<i> or DivX files using either DivX's service of Windows Media Server.
</I>So you sell copies for money and a promise to delete the copy after
it's use. That's like selling a book, printing &quot;Burn after reading&quot;
on it and calling yourself a library. Also the book shall not be used
for &quot;unauthorized uses&quot;, e.g. put under a table foot, lent to a friend
or read repeatedly. The latter two cases may be solved by going to the
&quot;library&quot; and buying another copy, other can't.

Many people see DRM as an hybrid between a lock and a automagical fire
lighter.

&gt;<i> For the content that is not protected the download or stream is metered so
</I>&gt;<i> the client can be charged only for the time they spent watching the content.
</I>&gt;<i> We error on the customer's side for things like buffering and misreported
</I>&gt;<i> play segments.
</I>This seems like a saner alternative.
&gt;<i> I think the discussion that DRM is irrelevant has its merits, but the
</I>&gt;<i> contracts and services at play have a real value regardless of how
</I>&gt;<i> distribution is restricted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For my purposes I am interested in application-controlled video delivery.  I
</I>&gt;<i> want to be able to deliver unprotected mp4, webm, or ogv content in a
</I>&gt;<i> metered way.  If the user has payed to watch the entire video once and has
</I>&gt;<i> managed to work around HTTP no-cache and the other constraints that a normal
</I>&gt;<i> browser viewed experience would have, then they will have succeeding in
</I>&gt;<i> downloading a copy of the video - a task which they could have accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> with a VM session or through other means regardless of DRM.  If we need
</I>&gt;<i> additionally protection we can add watermarking to legally go after content
</I>&gt;<i> thieves since we know the IP and username of the viewer in most cases.
</I>Once a user has bought a copy, the copy has been bought and how
(often) he uses said copy isn't your probem. You've successfully
distributed and charged for the content. Job's done. A technical user
will probably be able to copy the video to permanent storage whatever
you do. Multi-pricing can also be achieved by other means, such as by
resolution crippling. Watermarking to aid with tracking down grand scale
pirates seems to be an OK thing to do.

&gt;<i> My requests have focused on things like &quot;&lt;video minbuffer=100k
</I>&gt;<i> maxbuffer=200k&gt;&quot; which could also apply to a source element.  I want to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that the browser always uses &quot;Range: bytes x-y&quot; in requests (since I
</I>&gt;<i> have no other way to require that a browser use ranges or use ranges with an
</I>&gt;<i> upper bound).  I can use this tool to make sure UAs do not download more
</I>&gt;<i> content than the user has watched (which costs them money in some way).
</I>&gt;<i> I've also been suggesting HTTP changes that would permit this UA behavior
</I>&gt;<i> (a 4xx for Ranges Required, a 4xx for Range too large, or explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> defining that a 206 response can include less bytes than requested and the
</I>&gt;<i> UA should follow-up with additional ranged requests).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While an HTML5 solution is easy to make possible as their is no legacy to
</I>&gt;<i> worry about and the spec is still floating about, an HTTP solution would
</I>&gt;<i> allow me to provide metered content flow without leaving HTTP sessions open
</I>&gt;<i> (throttling) and without the need for a video element - permitting users to
</I>&gt;<i> use their native http streaming players.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These requests can be seen as generally allowing servers to reduce load for
</I>&gt;<i> video or large file downloads.  Since a client may be able to download 5
</I>&gt;<i> minutes of video in under a minute I would like to see the client disconnect
</I>&gt;<i> from the server and reconnect in 5 minutes to get the additional content.  I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to see the server have the ability to enforce this (through HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> errors) or at least suggest it (through HTML5 attributes or additional HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> headers).
</I>Server load can also be reduced by e.g. P2P, though users may want the
price to drop in proportion to their uploads.
