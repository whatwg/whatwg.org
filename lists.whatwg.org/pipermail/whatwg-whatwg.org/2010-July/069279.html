So, you're arguing that DRM is not required, right?

Basically the whole problem is about how current content distributors 
(e.g. BBC) have made stupid contracts in the history and are trying to 
work around those stupid contracts with DRM instead of doing the right 
thing and do one of the following:

(1) renegotiate the contracts to allow redistribution, or
(2) stop trying to redistribute content you don't have proper rights to do.

Especially, the content distributors should immediately stop pretending 
that DRM allows for any kind of protection. It's mathematically 
impossible. It's like trying to send an encrypted message to Bob with a 
requirement that Bob cannot have access to the message. That problem 
cannot be solved. For that problem, a decision needs to be made:

(1) Bob is allowed to get access to the message, or
(2) Bob is not allowed to get access to the message (never send it!)

Notice how this is similar to the DRM case above?

Introducing a DRM system is about *trying to not do the decision* if you 
really *want to distribute the content or not*. Such system should not 
ever be standardized because it really cannot ever work, by definition.
