Interesting idea, but out of scope for the spec. This is a UI issue, not a content issue. HTML5 has no authority over what happens when the user types in the address bar.

Here's some thoughts on the idea of making this change:

1) We probably can't disallow javascript: in bookmarks since many popular user features are distributed as bookmarklets. Does this still leave too much avenue for social engineering attack?

2) One possibility is to make javascript: URLs an optional developer-only feature in the UI. I don't know if we could get away with completely removing support in the address bar.

Regards,
Maciej
