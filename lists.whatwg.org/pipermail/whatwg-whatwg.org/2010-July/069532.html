I'll note that you didn't actually answer my question, which was whether 
changing the behavior here would actually have tangible security 
benefits.  I can see the security benefits of disallowing all 
cross-origin application of javascript: (if you don't know where it came 
from, don't apply it).  But it doesn't sound like you're suggesting 
that... and what you're suggesting seems to only close one of at least 
two equally easy to target social-engineering attacks.  In other words, 
its usefulness as a security measure relies on its not being implemented 
yet; the moment it's implemented the virus writers will switch to the 
other attack, no?

Now if we really think the other attack is harder to carry out, that's a 
different kettle of fish, as I said. But I see no evidence of that....
