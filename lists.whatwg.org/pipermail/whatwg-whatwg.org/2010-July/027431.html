</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, the autofocus attribute has been introduced to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To better fulfill this need, I think we should add two rules for the
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus attribute behavior:
</I>&gt;<i> - only the first element with the autofocus attribute specified should
</I>&gt;<i> get the focus. All other autofocus requests should be ignored. This is

</I>&gt;<i> element with the autofocus attribute specified but that would be better
</I>&gt;<i> for the user because it will prevent autofocus to move from a field to
</I>&gt;<i> another.
</I>&gt;<i> - if an element with the autofocus attribute specified is inserted after
</I>&gt;<i> the load event (or the 'DOMContentLoaded' event) it should not get the
</I>&gt;<i> focus. Having an element inserted in the document with the autofocus
</I>&gt;<i> attribute specified is just a way to prevent using .focus(). That is not
</I>&gt;<i> why autofocus has been introduced. If an author want to focus an element
</I>&gt;<i> after the load event, he/she should use .focus().

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When the c1 element is inserted into the DOM, the UA focuses this

</I>&gt;<i> currently states that the c2 element is the one that should be 
</I>&gt;<i> autofocused as that is the last one with autofocus specified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However the spec also makes the, IMHO good, recommendation to not 
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus an element if the user is already interacting with some other 
</I>&gt;<i> form control. The simplest way to implement this would be to not honor 
</I>&gt;<i> the autofocus attribute if another form control already has focus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is technically implementable. However it means that you have to 
</I>&gt;<i> keep track of if c1 was focused due to the user clicking on c1 (or 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise navigate to, for example using the keyboard), or if it was due 
</I>&gt;<i> to autofocus being specified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this isn't enough, as the user might have already started 
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with c1 by typing into it. Technically, c1 could still have 
</I>&gt;<i> been focused due to the autofocus, but if the user has started 
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with it, then this doesn't really matter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To make matters worse, the user might *just* be about to start 
</I>&gt;<i> interacting with it, but haven't yet done so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While we could deploy a bunch of heuristics, it seems much simpler to 
</I>&gt;<i> just say that it is the *first* element with autofocus that should 
</I>&gt;<i> receive focus. I can't think of any significant downsides with this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you both generally, but I disagree that there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> downsides. I imagine the main use-case where this sort of behaviour 
</I>&gt;<i> might be expected is a Javascript application which dynamically adds a 
</I>&gt;<i> new form to the page based on some user interaction and one of those 
</I>&gt;<i> fields should be autofocused when it's been added to the DOM.
</I>
I don't think that's the main use case. The main use case is static pages 
that just use script to focus the control.

However, I could see an argument that we should handle the case of a page 
that loads a stub script which then loads a blob of HTML in and inserts it 
after onload -- that, in combination with the points above, argues that we 
should not prevent autofocus from working after onload, but that we should 
make it only work once. I've specced that.


&gt;<i> For instance, picture the Gmail model. When you first load, the 
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus attribute could conceivably be on the inbox search field. When 
</I>&gt;<i> you click Compose, the compose form will be dynamically added and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;To&quot; field should be autofocused (but the search field is still 
</I>&gt;<i> on-screen)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose you could argue that it'd be up to the application to go and 
</I>&gt;<i> *remove* the previous autofocus attribute from the search field, or 
</I>&gt;<i> should manage focus as they currently do with HTMLInputElement.focus(), 
</I>&gt;<i> but I can see the simplicity that automatically moving the focus would 
</I>&gt;<i> represent for these sorts of applications.
</I>
In this kind of situation, you'd just use focus(). There's not much point 
using autofocus if you're already running code; the main win of the 
attribute is simplifying the page and not requiring scripting, but if 
you've already got code the cost of an additional focus() is minimal.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd also like to ask for two clarifications:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, the spec currently says:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The autofocus  content attribute allows the user to indicate that a
</I>&gt;<i> control is to be focused *as soon as the page is loaded*&quot; (emphasis
</I>&gt;<i> mine).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However it then goes on to describe that the control should receive 
</I>&gt;<i> focus as soon as it's inserted into the document. I would recommend 
</I>&gt;<i> changing the emphasized part to say &quot;as soon as it's inserted into the 
</I>&gt;<i> document&quot;.
</I>
While that would be more accurate, I don't think most authors think of 
parsing as inserting elements into the document, so I fear it may end up 
being less understandable. (The statement is non-normative, so I don't 
think it is of huge importance that it be technically precise.)


&gt;<i> Second, the only normative requirement that I can find is: &quot;Whenever an 
</I>&gt;<i> element with the autofocus attribute specified is inserted into a 
</I>&gt;<i> document whose browsing context did not have the sandboxed automatic 
</I>&gt;<i> features browsing context flag set when the Document was created, the 
</I>&gt;<i> user agent should queue a task that checks to see if the element is 
</I>&gt;<i> focusable, and if so, runs the focusing steps for that element&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nowhere in this does it restrict this to form controls. However the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> only defines the 'autofocus' attribute as valid on form controls. So I 
</I>&gt;<i> assume that the above requirement was intended to only apply to form 
</I>&gt;<i> controls? Or should you be allowed to autofocus links?
</I>
Only form controls have the autofocus attribute. An attribute with the 
name &quot;autofocus&quot; on other elements is not the autofocus attribute.

They are.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it not possible to say the autofocus attribute is readonly?
</I>
No, DOM attributes are inherently writable. It would be a layering 
violation to require otherwise.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What would you say about this:
</I>&gt;<i> - multiple autofocused elements per page are valid, but only one per form
</I>&gt;<i> - the actual effect, as suggested before, is restricted to the page loading
</I>&gt;<i> process and to the first element with the autofocus attribute
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like this, if you write an application that relies on forms received by XHR,
</I>&gt;<i> and if you don't know the form structure at authoring time, it is not
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to add a function that, after the form is inserted, looks for an
</I>&gt;<i> element with autofocus and focus()es it at runtime.
</I>
I don't think it makes sense for the focus to move multiple times, so I 
don't think we should allow multiple autofocus=&quot;&quot; attributes. This is 
doubly the case now that multiple autofocus=&quot;&quot; attributes have no effect.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm just missing the problem you're trying to solve here?
</I>
I think once we introduce a &quot;dialog box&quot; concept, that it would make sense 
to reset the &quot;autofocus&quot; concept to apply again in that context. But we 
don't currently have such a concept.
