This seems to be the exact semantic of &lt;input type=file multiple&gt;, the 
only difference is in the UI. But it seems that it's the _user_ who has to 
decide whether he wants to upload a whole directory or a bunch of files 
from many directories, so the _user_ should be the one who decides whether 
the UI allows whole-directory selection or just file selection.

</I>
The spec doesn't preclude the filename from containing a relative path, 
nor does it preclude the files from all having the same name. What data is 
uploaded is really up to the browser here. We don't need a new control for 
this.

It was never disallowed, but I've made it explicit.

That's &quot;just&quot; UI; we don't need to specify it. Different browsers can find 
different solutions. For example, one option would be for a browser to 
change the rendering of &lt;input type=file&gt; from the current typical UI:

   [_____________________________] (( Browse... ))

...to:

   [_________________________] (( Browse... | V ))

...where the drop-down shows:

   [_________________________] (( Browse... | V ))
          | Select multiple files...             |
          | Select directory...                  |
          | Take photograph from camera...       |
          | Record video from camera...          |
          | Record sound file from microphone... |

Right, that's more the realm of the File Writer API.

That sounds like a bug.

</I>
I don't see why we'd need to expose the directories themselves. Really 
only the files matter. The directories are just part of the file names.

Indeed.
