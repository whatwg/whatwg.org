<PRE>Thanks, so it seems to make sure a fallback entry is used when offline, cache-control has to be used.

Like Opera, Chrome respects the http cache when first attempting to &quot;fetch normally&quot; a resource that falls in a fallback namespace. I'm reasonably certain WebKit does the same.

&quot;Normal&quot; means just that... first do what the browser would do if there was no Application Cache... only if that fails to produce a good response, do something extra.

At least in Opera, it will still respect the browser's normal cache header. So the network section header will just bypass the application cache, and will load normally like any other web page, which means respecting (i.e, not bypassing) the normal cache.

Subject: [whatwg] About bypassing caches for URLs listed in Fallback and/or Network section in a HTML5 Offline Web Application

Hi,

In spec HTML5 for offline web application (<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#offline">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#offline</A>) chapter 6.6.6, item 3, 4, 5 state that for resources that is in online whitelist (or has wildcard whitelist), or fallback list, it should be fetched &quot;normally&quot;.

I would like to know does it mean the user agent (browser) should bypass its own caches (besides html5 appcache), like the WebKit cache and browser http stack cache?

Best Regards
Lyon Chen
