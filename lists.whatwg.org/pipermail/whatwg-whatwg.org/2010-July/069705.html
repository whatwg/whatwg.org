These two definitions are non-normative. They're just meant to provide a 
basic introduction to the features in question.


&gt;<i> If that is the case then I recommend clarifying that constraint in the 
</I>&gt;<i> description of the pattern attribute and when describing 
</I>&gt;<i> patternMismatch.
</I>
I don't see what's ambiguous. The only place in the spec that has a 
normative statement regarding whether something is &quot;Suffering from a 
pattern mismatch&quot; is the section on the pattern=&quot;&quot; attribute, and that 
section is a subsection of a section that says &quot;These attributes only 
apply to an input element if its type attribute is in a state whose 
definition declares that the attribute applies. When an attribute doesn't 
apply to an input element, user agents must ignore the attribute, 
regardless of the requirements and definitions below.&quot;.

Indeed.

The types for which it doesn't apply are types where it doesn't make much 
sense to apply it; basically anything where the user isn't going to be 
typing raw text. I guess we can add a non-normative note to the top of 
each attribute's section saying to what it applies, but doing that would 
be a pain... if anyone can provide a script that scrapes the source 
document to determine what states each attribute applies to, and then has 
some way to update the generated source to have the right information, I'd 
be happy to add it to the pipeline. Contact me off-list if you're 
interested in helping with this.
