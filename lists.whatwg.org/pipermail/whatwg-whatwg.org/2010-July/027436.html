</I>&gt;<i> Make that HTMLCollection (and all HTML*Collection, as a consequence of

</I>&gt;<i> (forEach, map, filter...) added in ECMAScript5 (and next versions which 
</I>&gt;<i> should go in the same direction).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, adding this won't break any existing code. The 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics of a Collection and the way it is used is very close from 
</I>&gt;<i> ECMAScript Arrays. I don't think that the notion of &quot;live object&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> ECMAScript Array are incompatible either. Once again, I am talking about 
</I>&gt;<i> ECMAScript binding. I have no intention to touch the HTMLCollection 
</I>&gt;<i> interface or other languages bindings.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTMLCollection.prototype.__proto__ = Array.prototype;

</I>&gt;<i> document.getElementsByTagName('div').forEach(function(el) {
</I>&gt;<i>   el.parentNode.removeChild(el); // doesn't work as expected

</I>&gt;<i> // turning live collection into static array fixes this

</I>&gt;<i> I think I can take your point as a &quot;pro&quot; more than a &quot;con&quot;, because in

</I>&gt;<i> like the following can be found :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The range of elements processed by forEach is set before the first call 
</I>&gt;<i> to callbackfn. Elements which are appended to the array after the call 
</I>&gt;<i> to forEach begins will not be visited by callbackfn. If existing 
</I>&gt;<i> elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to callback 
</I>&gt;<i> will be the value at the time forEach visits them; elements that are 
</I>&gt;<i> deleted after the call to forEach begins and before being visited are 
</I>&gt;<i> not visited.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This point is confirmed by every algorithm where the length is &quot;saved&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> once for all before the loop and not got from the .length property each 
</I>&gt;<i> time.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have thought a lot about weirdnesses that people could think about 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; like trying to assign a value to the HTMLCollection (divs[14] = 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; myOtherDiv), but once again, it wouldn't be more allowed than it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; currently is (I have no idea of what happens today, but if an error 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is thrown in a for-loop, it should throw an error as well in a call 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; within a forEach).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How would destructive methods like `push` or `sort` behave? Would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `document.body.childNodes.push(document.createTextNode('foo'))` append 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text node to a body element? Or would it be a noop?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is actually a very good point. It think that the behavior should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be exactly the same as &quot;an equivalent without array methods&quot;. (this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point of my proposal would need to be made completly explicit for each 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; method)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One way to solve this could be to split Array into two interfaces. One 
</I>&gt;<i> to be used with immutable array like objects and one to use to mutate 
</I>&gt;<i> objects. Then we could apply the immutable array like interface to 
</I>&gt;<i> NodeList and its related interfaces. The benefit of doing that is that 
</I>&gt;<i> NodeList.prototype.push would be undefined instead of failing when 
</I>&gt;<i> called.

</I>&gt;<i> Rather that trying to make DOM collections feel like arrays, how about 
</I>&gt;<i> just giving them a toArray() method?  This makes it clear that a 
</I>&gt;<i> collection is not an array, but clearly defines a way to obtain an 
</I>&gt;<i> array.  Clever implementors might even be able to optimize common 
</I>&gt;<i> uses-cases using some kind of copy-on-write strategy so that toArray() 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't involve memory allocation and copying.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, trying to teach programmers when they ought to call toArray() 
</I>&gt;<i> and when it is not necessary is another matter.  Perhaps calling the 
</I>&gt;<i> method snapshot() and focusing on the live vs. static distinction 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the fake array vs. true array distinction would invite less 
</I>&gt;<i> misuse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or we can just leave the DOM as it is and get used to calling the 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent of Prototype's $A() function.
</I>
Before changing something this substantial, I'd like to have implementor 
feedback regarding what the best way to address this is:

 - somehow make HTMLCollections and NodeLists inherit from Array?

 - define a bunch of feature on HTMLCollections and NodeLists so that 
   they're like arrays?

 - provide a toArray() method or equivalent?

 - do nothing?

 - something else?
