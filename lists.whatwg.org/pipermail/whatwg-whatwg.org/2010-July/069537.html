If the bookmarklets feature is important, and it has security
implications, which it does -- then the addition of bookmarklets
should be tied into the browser's whitelist/blacklist mechanisms for
protection from phishing.  In fact it would seem to be a major
omission if bookmarklets aren't already being checked against phishing
blacklists.

That may also suggest a way to handle javascript URLs typed straight
into the addressbar: all javascript URLs that don't have a known
source (being dragged from a web page) should be blacklisted by
default, and whitelist/blacklist rules should be applied to URLs that
have a known source on a webpage.

</I>
Answer: yes, changing the behavior of the addressbar will have
tangible security benefits.  (1) Blacklisting typed javascript URLs
will close the current security hole -- otherwise that hole will
continue to be exploited for perpetuity.  (2) Yes, it's clear that
asking a user to drag a link to their addressbar to bookmark it, and
then click on it, adds additional complexity that will weed out some
users -- it's harder to exploit this.  (Asking them to open the js
console and paste code in there is definitely in the &quot;too hard to be
worth it&quot; category.)  And, separately from tie-in with the
anti-phishing system, Mike's solution to warn the user about
bookmarklets the first time they drag one to the address bar or
bookmarks bar is a good one (perhaps it should be done per-site?)

&gt;<i> &#160;I can see the security benefits of disallowing all cross-origin application
</I>&gt;<i> of javascript: (if you don't know where it came from, don't apply it).
</I>
Yes, that is actually a really good way to put things -- javascript
typed into the URL bar is cross-origin.  (And dragging bookmarklets to
the address bar or bookmarks bar is also cross-origin, that's the
reason that a security check should be applied and/or user warning
given.)

Facebook already disallows the execution of arbitrary js code on a fan
page, of course, which is why these viruses require you to manually
copy/paste into the addressbar.

&gt;<i> Now if we really think the other attack is harder to carry out, that's a
</I>&gt;<i> different kettle of fish, as I said. But I see no evidence of that....
</I>
No, I appreciate you bringing up the bookmarklets example.  I think
both holes should be closed.  The point is that disabling js URLs in
the addressbar by default (re-enablable with a developer option) is a
nobrainer that will only adversely impact a very small number of
people, and only until they re-enable the option.  People who would
want this enabled should be knowledgeable enough not to paste rogue js
code into their own browser.  As for bookmarklets, I think the
anti-phishing system should fix that.  The starting point would be to
blacklist all of facebook.com for javascript:* cross-site js code...
