I agree. I don't condone illegally distributing digital content, but DRM
doesn't have a good track record. At best, it disrupts illegal copyright
infringement, at its worst, it harms the honest consumer. The game Spore
was arguably one of the most copyrighted games ever, despite (or maybe
because of) its almost draconian DRM. DVD's suffered for a long time
with being locked into regions by DRM, making it difficult for people
who travelled a lot but wanted to watch films, and made little or no
impact on those that obtained an illegal DRM-free copy. There are
countless more tales all like this, but until a fiscally viable
alternative is offered to the media companies (as let's face it, it's
not the artists pushing for DRM!) then we will continue to see more
measures brought into place and broken.

Thanks,
Ash
