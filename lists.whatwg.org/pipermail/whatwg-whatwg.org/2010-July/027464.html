My point was that a programmer really shouldn't do anything differently
whether or not the API is available.  But you're probably right that it'd
only push such an author towards user-agent sniffing which is of course
worse.

I just had another thought.  Although I strongly feel that the spec
shouldn't guarantee when the data is deleted (and should probably have some
non-normative text explaining why) we could (if we wanted to) guarantee that
data won't be available to the page after that time.  (Of course subject to
run to completion constraints--if the user calls localStorage.length, we
can't delete the item until they leave the scripting context.  Also there's
a question of whether we'd fire StorageEvents while something's timed out.
 Maybe we should just expire stuff when navigating to a page and not while
the page is running?)
