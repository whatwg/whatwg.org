I do not understand the use case you descrbe.

Right.


&gt;<i> If you're using a background image then that shouldn't need to convey 
</I>&gt;<i> any meaning to the viewer, it should only be for presentation purposes. 
</I>&gt;<i> The meaning of the content should remain the same if the background

</I>&gt;<i> re-structuring your page so that the presentation is separate from the 
</I>&gt;<i> content.
</I>
Indeed.

Amongst other things, yes.

Right.

A rather odd sense. :-)


&gt;<i> Sprites for icons, while widely used and considered fairly good 
</I>&gt;<i> practice, still seem pretty hack-ish to me.  Icons can (arguably) help 
</I>&gt;<i> convey meaning in a document, and changing a background position to 
</I>&gt;<i> change that meaning doesn't seem like the best way of achieving this.  
</I>&gt;<i> I am of course thinking like 10 years into the future here, as sprites 
</I>&gt;<i> are perfectly fine for lots of uses today, but as concurrent connections 
</I>&gt;<i> become less of a problem, I think lots of us will look back on sprites 
</I>&gt;<i> the same way we see spacer.gifs, which were a necessary evil at the 
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
Using CSS to display content is a misuse of the technology, certainly.

Right. (No, wait. I mean, &quot;Indeed&quot;.)
