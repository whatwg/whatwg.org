If I remember correctly and dont ask me for a link to where I read it
but the problem is still patent suits I believe. MPEG-LA as soon as they
heard about the VP8 codec open sourcing they said they were getting a
patent pool together to challenge its adoption anywhere. Although I
believe that there is nothing to worry about because Google has a huge
patent pool to fight back with. 

I think this issue is still a huge sticking point for everyone and I
dont see a resolution other than to let everyone use whats comfortable
and see what sticks. Its a waiting game im afraid but as for adding webm
to the HTML5 spec I still dont think we can add it at this stage IMHO.

As for Apple not picking it up you would have to ask someone at Apple.
Id say its still the threat from MPEG-LA's patent pool that still hasnt
attacked Theora like it said it would a few years back so it seems like
an empty threat to me.
