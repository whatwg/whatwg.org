It doesn't actually matter what element the URI appears in - your
element has to deal with the data that it receives and if
&quot;file.ogv#t=1:00,1:15&quot; is an Ogg Theora segment out of a video, then
that is what the &lt;img&gt; element receives.

Of course you can call any file any name, so if &quot;file.ogv&quot; is an
animated gif or an animated png (contrary to what your file extension
indicates), then your &lt;img&gt; element may be able to deal with it. I am
not aware though of any &lt;img&gt; element implementation that can deal
with Ogg Theora video.

If you are, however, asking to turn the Ogg Theora video into a APNG
or a animated GIF or even a MNG, there will need to be a transcoding
step at the server, which means you have to change the mime type of
your resource &quot;file.ogv&quot;, which means, it cannot continue to be called
&quot;file.ogv&quot;. So, if you really want to do it this way, you can only use
a URI query to transcode your resource into a different mime type and
would need to use a URI such as e.g.
&quot;file.ogv?t=1:00,1:15&amp;target=apng&quot; such that the server knows what
mime type to return instead of the original one.

The gist of the issue is: A fragment (&quot;#&quot;) addition to a URI is not
allowed to change the mime type of the resource, since it only points
to a subresource, i.e. basically only to a byte range of the original
resource. But you can do anything to your resource if you use a URI
query (&quot;?&quot;).

Cheers,
Silvia.
