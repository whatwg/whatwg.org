Why does this require JS to be purely functional?  There's already work 
happening in this direction, though obviously arbitrary object graphs 
are hard due to the mutability.

If we eliminate mutability (e.g. sealing the objects in the relevant 
graph), then the memory could in fact be shared instead of copied, right?

Note that some current JS engines support this (though not in a web 
context at the moment).

Note also that said engines are removing said support for various 
reasons (performance penalties are a large part of it).

&gt;<i> Is not allowing deadlocks important enough that we should make

Possibly, yes.

At what performance cost in the typical case, though?
