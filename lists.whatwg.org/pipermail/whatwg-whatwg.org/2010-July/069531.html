Is there a better venue to discuss this then?  (It seems like even if
UI issues are out of the scope of what WHATWG is working on, all the
right people are signed up to this list...)

&gt;<i> Would a UA that asked for the

</I>&gt;<i> prompt the first time a given helper app or URL scheme is used) be

</I>
You mean like Windows User Account Control? ;)

That would be the ideal solution.

It's not unreasonable to guess that the number of people
inconvenienced by the easy exploitability of the current behavior
numbers in the millions, given that Facebook has 500M users and these
viruses continue to spread like wildfire.  The number inconvenienced
by having these URLs disabled by default (and re-enableable via a
developer option the first time they hit this limitation) would be
several orders of magnitude smaller than that number.

Given the success of these exploits so far, it is also reasonable to
suggest that the sophistication of attack will only increase with
time.
