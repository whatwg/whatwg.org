I encourage anyone who would like a general crypto API to write one.

Why not?

If you trust the client, then it's safe (by definition). If you don't, 
then you've pretty much lost anyway (the client could just intercept all 
communication as it happens).

If you're worried about cached data falling into the wrong hands but can 
guarantee that:

 - the client is secure until it falls into the wrong hands

 - the client will have expired data securely before it falls into the 
   wrong hands

 - the client has no stored passwords

 - the client leaves no compromising data in RAM or in temporary 
   locations (e.g. the swapfile) on disk.

...then encrypting the data with a server-provided key in JS seems 
reasonable, but is this really a situation that we can seriously expect to 
happen?

</I>&gt;<i> storage should have some basic crypto built-in, so why not start here?
</I>
It's not clear to me what problem it solves. In most cases, it would not 
increase security at all.


&gt;<i> In regards to data expiration, part of ensuring the security of data is 
</I>&gt;<i> knowing how long it will be stored on disk. If I let someone borrow my 
</I>&gt;<i> computer to check their email, and the email client happens to save some 
</I>&gt;<i> data onto the client, then that person's data will now be on my disk for 
</I>&gt;<i> who knows how long. That represents a data security issue.
</I>
For them or for you? For them, if they don't trust you, then they 
shouldn't be relying on your computer in the first place. You could just 
save their password, or their session cookie, or be logging all network 
traffic and TLS keys as they're generated (and thus be able to read any of 
the e-mails they saw even if they aren't stored locally), etc.


&gt;<i> By allowing an expiration date to be tied to the data, you can have 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable assurance that the data isn't just going to be sitting around 
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for someone to try and use it.
</I>
We could add per-key metadata to localStorage relatively easily (basically 
by having a parallel API that returns an object with the metadata instead 
of the value). I recommend we wait until more of the new features are 
implemented before adding more new features, though... we don't even have 
a test suite for localStorage yet!

Having said that, it's not clear to me that expiry dates are especially 
compelling, even from a security standpoint.

</I>
If you're worried about data loss to that extent, I'd recommend whole disk 
encryption and never suspending your laptop. Expiry dates aren't going to 
save you much, especially for something like e-mail since you're 
presumably going to always be using the mail client.

What is the use case? Why is a JS library insufficent?


&gt;<i> The main cases I have:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Storage needs to be encrypted on disk, device etc.
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Data needs to be in decrypted form for the shortest amount of time
</I>&gt;<i>    possible while in use in an application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My gut, general feeling is that encryption of information to and from 
</I>&gt;<i> storage is moot, because introspection of a running app is so 
</I>&gt;<i> unbelievably easy.  However, on disk storage *must* be encrypted and 
</I>&gt;<i> sandboxed.  i.e, data needs to be only available to the domain running 
</I>&gt;<i> the code, and it cannot be peaked at by examining the disk.
</I>
If it's made available to any page running on that domain, that means it's 
available to any code on the machine, since the browser has to do the 
decryption and isn't from the domain. So that doesn't seem safe.

You'd need at a minimum to have the server be the only agent that stores 
the key for an extended period, and just have it pass the key to the 
client when it loads the page, and not have it store it. (But then you're 
still relying on the browser not caching that in any way.)

Write up a spec and get browser buy-in. :-)
