You are right, the iframe source could be an image, text, or pdf file or 
whatever, without meta or script elements. But an in-page HTML solution 
would of course make opting-in very easy for authors.

I tried to read about CORS, but did not understand the whole of it. Can 
CORS be set up via server-side scripting, with PHP or whatever? Then it 
will be an acceptable solution, and sooner or later libraries will be 
available for both the server and the client side.

If CORS must be set up by the server administrator, it will be a problem 
in shared hosting environments.

Anyway, for something that looks as easy as allowing an iframe to 
seamlessly integrate a document, the overhead of server-side setup and 
client-side scripting looks huge to me, and it also has the downside of 
being dependent on Javascript.
