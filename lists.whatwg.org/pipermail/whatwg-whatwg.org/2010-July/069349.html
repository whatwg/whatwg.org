I'll just note that part of the reason it's a &quot;stress test&quot;, apart from 
the old Firefox issue, is that it tries to be clever and not hang the 
browser.... which actually causes the browser to do a lot more work.  On 
my machine here, if the spec's script were not trying for the clever 
thing, it would take about 1-2 seconds (with a completely hung browser 
during that time) to do what it currently takes anywhere from 8 to 25 
seconds to do, during which time the browser is largely unresponsive anyway.
