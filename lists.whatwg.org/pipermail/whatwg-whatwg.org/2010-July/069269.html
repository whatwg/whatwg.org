</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to cover this use-case, it would be good if there were a way of

</I>&gt;<i> be emulated by #t=10,10.001 or something, assuming the frame starts at
</I>&gt;<i> exactly t=10.)
</I>
The issue with #t=10,10 is that the semantics of the interval are that
of a semi-open interval: the start point is in and the end point is
out. This has been the traditional understanding of an interval
related to video (e.g. RTSP defines it that way too). Thus,
&quot;video.ogv#t=10,10&quot; is like asking from byte range 50 to 50 - it's
simply empty.

Further, there are complications with extracting a single frame from a
video since not every point in time will map onto a keyframe, but most
will map onto intra frames, i.e. non-complete frames. Thus, if you ask
for #t=10,10.001, you will most likely receive a region around that
time segment that is a decodable video byte range - maybe a region
that maps to #t=9.02, 12.4 - the UA will know what it asked for and be
able to display only the actually requested part in the middle after
decoding all the bits.

To repeat: I am not convinced it is a good idea to support the video
mime type in an &lt;img&gt; element, even if we change the semantics and
ignore the audio etc. I am not saying it is not possible, I am just
saying that I would not recommend it and would suggest to rather do it
on the server with some transcoding action - it is really not
difficult to install ffmpeg or mplayer on the server, develop a query
format that delivers keyframes from a particular time offset, and do a
keyframe dump on the server upon request. You might want to cache the
result, too.

Cheers,
Silvia.
