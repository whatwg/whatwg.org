</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, my opinion is that images in links should have borders 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; because otherwise how do you know it's a link?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; This seems to be a minority view, though. People have been 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; explicitly turning off this cue for literally over a decade.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think that browser defaults should make sense when the page is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rendered Without author styles.  While authors often override this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; particular feature, there they have the option to represent linked 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; images in other ways such as hover states, or more attractive 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; borders etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Authors also often overwrite many other browser defaults such as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; font, styles for horizontal rules, often margins on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; paragraphs/headings/lists etc. But it's probably not a good idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; set these things to zero.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At the end of the day, I've never found turning off borders much of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a hassle as an author.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As Ian said, though, borders are turned off *so often* that I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think it's an actual cue to users.  The actual cue I, and many normal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people I know of, use to see if an image is a link is to put the mouse 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cursor over it and see if it turns into a pointer.  That's still 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present, so we should be good.  It's not ideal for mobile browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without an explicit pointer, but I get along fine on my phone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A point that Ian also noted was where styles were turned off, or the 
</I>&gt;<i> page was viewed in a browser not capable of displaying styles. Yes 
</I>&gt;<i> they're rare, but they do exist. As he said, it's not a huge effort to 
</I>&gt;<i> turn them off in a stylesheet, and is often just one of many things 
</I>&gt;<i> people 'reset' along with table cell padding, header margins, font 
</I>&gt;<i> sizes, etc. These are among the most often styles that I see people 
</I>&gt;<i> typically change, and it's usually the same kinds of changes. Should the 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers all change their behaviour to follow what is the trend of 
</I>&gt;<i> styling now, or remain historically consistent and let the developers do 
</I>&gt;<i> a little more legwork.
</I>
The thing is, people have been turning it off with &quot;border=0&quot; for a long 
time, to the point where even non-CSS browsers don't reliably show this 
cue. I don't think it makes sense to insist on this (superior, IMHO) 
rendering, in the face of such frequent author disagreement.


&gt;<i> There is another side to this as well: what bandwidth impact might this 
</I>&gt;<i> have if stylesheets online didn't have to consistently change the 
</I>&gt;<i> default behaviour for popular elements?
</I>
The impact here would be minimal either way.
