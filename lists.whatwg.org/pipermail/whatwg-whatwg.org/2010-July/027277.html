</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of doing, it'll probably take me months before I'm done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information about the format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The WebSRT stuff itself is pretty modular, it's just two sections:

That is good to know, though it's unfortunate that this has to be
asked and isn't obvious by reading the spec. A related question is how
will I find out if this list changes. I think making these sections
available as a separate spec will significantly increase the number of
people that will review it.

Is there a reason not to, given that, as I understand it, there is
tool support for producing separate spec documents.

&gt;<i> The lack of introductory material and examples is absolutely a problem and
</I>&gt;<i> I have every intention of adding much such material in the near future. I
</I>&gt;<i> apologise for not having it already written; I generally delay writing the
</I>&gt;<i> introductory material until after zcorpan, hsivonen, jgraham, Philip`,
</I>&gt;<i> annevk, and others have looked at the spec, so that I don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite the introductory material several times as it tracks the changes
</I>&gt;<i> resulting from the major bugs they find. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, the main place to start right now is the syntax of the
</I>&gt;<i> WebSRT file, which is defined separate from the parser:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/video.html#syntax-0">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/video.html#syntax-0</A>
</I>
Good to know that this is on the way. I tried reading the section you
are quoting, but it was still more work than I have feel like I have
time for, especially given that I'm not an expert on timed text. I
suspect I'll just end up waiting until the introductory sections are
available.
