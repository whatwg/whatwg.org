(In general this is a bit loose because I don't really see any advantage

forces the server to immediately respond.)

I presume you mean it's possible for the server to send something back 
like 0x0D 0x20 &quot;101&quot; 0x20 0x0D 0x0A.

I've added a step saying that the UA must bail if there's any other 0x0Ds 
in the string.

The idea is that the client can try to connect to a server without knowing 
what protocol it supports at all, and find out what protocol it supports. 
This also allows servers to be updated to list a subprotocol in 
preparation for supporting multiple subprotocols, without having to 
explicitly hide the subprotocol declaration in the case when the UA didn't 
specify one.
