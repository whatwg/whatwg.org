Thank you and Boris for your examples. I see the security issues. Anyway 
It would be very helpful in cases like mine, where security and privacy 
are not affected, to get an easy way to do this opt-in without the need 
of complex scripting, and independent from @seamless. Embedding content 
from external providers looks like a quite common case to me, and an 
easy opt-in mechanism would help both the customers and the providers of 
embedded content.

 &gt; Experience shows this to not be the case.  People blindly apply CSS

 &gt; rendering is &quot;right&quot;; I will bet money there are pages out there that
 &gt; use display:block on iframes just to get linebreaks before/after and
 &gt; will break if the sizing behavior changes.

A BC problem with display:block would only occur if an author applied 
this declaration _without_ applying dimensions, which looks quite weird 
to me. I admit I have no statistics about this, and no means to get 
statistics. But I can hardly imagine that there are many pages like this 
out there, as the default dimensions that browsers apply to iframes are 
quite special. But anyway, I do not insist in this solution, it was just 
an idea that looked consistent to me as an author with little technical 
backgrownd knowledge.
