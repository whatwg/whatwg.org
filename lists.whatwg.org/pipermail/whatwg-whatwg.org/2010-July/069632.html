</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, are you covering canonicalization?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes.  The three main things I'm hoping to cover are parsing,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> canonicalization, and resolving relative URLs.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is there any place in the Web platform where &quot;canonicalize&quot; is exposed by itself in a Web-facing way? I think resolve against a base and parse into components are the only algorithms whose effects can be observed directly. I think we only need to spec &quot;canonicalize&quot; if it turns out to be a useful subroutine.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I know, you can only see f(x) =
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> canonicalize(parse(resolve(x))) and also some breakdown components of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> f(x) in HTMLAnchorElement and window.location.hash (and friends).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Conceptually, it's a bit easier to think about them as three separate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> functions.  The main difference between parse and canonicalize is that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parse segments the input and canonicalize takes the segments, mutates
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them, and assembles them into a new string.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't studied resolve in as much detail yet, so I'm less clear how
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that fits into the puzzle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would consider canonicalize() to be part of resolve(). Every time you retrieve a &quot;cooked&quot; URL (as opposed to original source text), you both resolve it against a possible base and canonicalize it as a single step. The two are not exposed separately. It's not clear to me that making this operation into three separate steps with a parse in the middle is helpful, or even representative of a good implementation strategy. I would think of parse() as something that happens after canonicalization in the cases where single components of the URL are exposed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's an interesting way to think about what's going on.  Different
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the URL get different canonicalization transformations
</I>&gt;<i> applied to them.  For example, the range of characters that make sense
</I>&gt;<i> in a host name are different than those that make sense in a port or
</I>&gt;<i> query, so, in some sense, the canonicalization algorithm needs to
</I>&gt;<i> understand something about how the URL parses, or at least how to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish host names from, e.g., ports and queries.
</I>
Yes, but the relative resolution algorithm needs to find URL part boundaries as well. I guess part of the issue here is that we have two different senses of &quot;parse&quot;:

(1) Find the URL component boundaries in a source string, to be used by other algorithms for reference purposes. In that sense, you may need to do it to both the base URL and the possibly-relative reference before resolve(). However, this step isn't really exposed directly to the Web.

(2) Extract URL components of a resolved canonicalized URL, with the appropriate post-processing to expose them via APIs like Location and HTMLAnchorElement.

I've been thinking of parse() in sense #2, since that is the version actually exposed as API. You can think of this as taking a resolved canonicalized URL as input, and having a tuple of strings representing the components as output. The only other public operation is resolve+canonicalize, which conceptually takes a base URL, a possibly relative URL reference, and an optional document encoding as input, and which produces the resolved canonicalized URL as output.

While there are other ways to factor these operations, using a different approach will make it less obvious how to glue them to the relevant other specs.

Regards,
Maciej
