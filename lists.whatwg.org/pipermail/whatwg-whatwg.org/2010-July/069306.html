Yes.

</I>
Yes, let's get Amazon MP3 and the Itunes store closed down immediately.  I'm
not lobbying for DRM inclusion into HTML5 - I'm looking for server side HTML
or HTTP ways to limit transfer sizes.

Once a user has bought a copy, the copy has been bought and how
&gt;<i> (often) he uses said copy isn't your probem. You've successfully
</I>&gt;<i> distributed and charged for the content. Job's done. A technical user
</I>&gt;<i> will probably be able to copy the video to permanent storage whatever
</I>&gt;<i> you do. Multi-pricing can also be achieved by other means, such as by
</I>&gt;<i> resolution crippling. Watermarking to aid with tracking down grand scale
</I>&gt;<i> pirates seems to be an OK thing to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I know that a technical user will have the ability to do this.  They will
have at least paid for one copy.


&gt;<i> Server load can also be reduced by e.g. P2P, though users may want the
</I>&gt;<i> price to drop in proportion to their uploads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am using a standard video format and standard HTTP/HTML to distribute
video.  You don't see many P2P HTTP solutions around these days.

Bandwidth isn't the issue in my case, but I would rather have the user
disconnect from the server and play the video they've got before requesting
more.  The less open / throttled connections the server has to deal with the
better it performs.
