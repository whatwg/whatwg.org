</I>

There is no issue with any of this. SRT is indeed successful. Also, it is
indeed important to look at existing formats. I once held the opinion that
we should support SRT as one of the most basic formats and DFXP as a highly
capable format. I still don't mind about supporting SRT, but it's obviously
not sufficient. Also, for our purposes, DFXP seems not to work. ASS/SSA was
deemed too complex and incompatible with CSS. Thus, the creation of a new
format was pursued.

WebSRT is a suggestion for a new format and one reason for its creation was
that it would keep implementation costs for standalone players low because
it can build on existing SRT infrastructure. I simply doubted whether it
actually meets this goal, while Henri even more fundamentally doubted
whether this is a valid goal. I've heard previously that whenever the W3C
has tried to create a format that is also usable outside the Web, the design
decisions that were made because of trying to make it work outside the Web
have always turned out to be poor decisions. I don't have examples (maybe
somebody else has?), but I can believe that trying to serve two masters is
never a good idea - you might end up not serving either.
