</I>

I tested cutting off the HTTP connection and browsers didn't handle this.  I
realize I may need to test a deeper sever than a php exit() can provide.  I
have essentially tested this (but not this exactly - filehandles, sessions,
additional code, etc):
&lt;?php
header(&quot;HTTP/1.1 206 partial&quot;);
header(&quot;Accept-Ranges: bytes&quot;);
header(&quot;Content-Range: bytes 0-999999/1000000&quot;);
header(&quot;Content-Length: 1000000&quot;);  // report 1000k
echo str_repeat(&quot; &quot;, 1000); // return 1k
exit();

and found that browsers do not attempt to refetch the data or continue with
a 206 for the next block.

Shouldn't something like this be be worked into the protocol or the language
instead of having to break the stream at a higher level?

Consider the existing 4xx errors.   The server can tell the client that the
request data was too large (1k? - 413/414) or that a &quot;content-length&quot; is
required (411) but not that the range length is required or too large
(1gb?).

&gt;<i> A 200 response or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partial 206 responses that returns less than the full requested range is
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handled by browsers in a consistent or usable way (for this purpose).
</I>&gt;<i>  Only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Chrome will continue to fetch where the previous short 206 response left
</I>&gt;<i> off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (request 1-10, server replies 1-5, request 6-10, server replies 6-10).
</I>&gt;<i>  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTTP spec isn't clear about whether UAs should take this behavior - and
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they don't.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some UAs request video without sending &quot;Range: bytes 0-&quot;.  The server has
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to negotiate that the UA (a) must use ranges to complete the request
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that (b) the range requested is too large, retry will a smaller range.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need to return less than the browser requests, until it
</I>&gt;<i> actually uses up the bandwidth the user has paid for.  Let the browser
</I>&gt;<i> fetch as much of the video as the user wants to view, using
</I>&gt;<i> preload=metadata when that's supported by all browsers.  Every time
</I>&gt;<i> the server sends a new chunk of video to the user, it should deduct
</I>&gt;<i> that much from the user's current balance.  When the user has received
</I>&gt;<i> as much video as he's paid for, just have the script exit without
</I>&gt;<i> sending more output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
prefetch=&quot;metadata&quot; is the plan - but how far forward will the browser
attempt to buffer? When will the browser stop buffering and start playing? I
think the server/service/html/http side of things should have some say.  I
wouldn't want to see browser X seek 10 seconds ahead while browser Y fetches
60 seconds in advance.

I think buffer=&quot;&quot; is a reasonable attribute.  buffer=&quot;&quot; being akin to
minbuffer=&quot;&quot; I feel that a maxbuffer=&quot;&quot; is also reasonable.  Again - this
would be easier than getting HTTP spec changes made.

You don't have to return a proper Range header and expect the browser
&gt;<i> to issue new requests.  Just pretend you're serving the whole
</I>&gt;<i> resource, then cut it off unexpectedly before you've actually returned
</I>&gt;<i> all the content.  The browser will handle this fine, it will just
</I>&gt;<i> treat it as a network error.  A client-side script can then detect the
</I>&gt;<i> error and present nice UI.
</I>

As I stated before - this didn't pan out for me - I will happily test other
methods.

Thanks.
