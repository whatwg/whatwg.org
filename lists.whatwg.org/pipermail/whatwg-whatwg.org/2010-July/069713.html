Indeed.

Furthermore, the use cases seem to cover two different cases:

In the first case, we have a situation where one service provider is 
offering a number of services under one name, from which each user is 
expected to select one.

In the second and third cases, we have a situation where many service 
providers are offering different services under one name, from which again 
each user is expected to select one.

The first use case is easily solved: provide a canonical URL for the 
service, and have the service automatically pick one. This is what Google 
does; if you visit <A HREF="http://google.com/">http://google.com/</A> it redirects you to the most 
appropriate domain for you.

The other two cases are more complicated. We'd have to define generic 
concepts -- &quot;social network&quot;, &quot;search&quot;. We'd have to have a mechanism to 
avoid sites spamming that system -- porn sites shouldn't be able to claim 
to be the user's local post office, for instance. It's not really clear to 
me how we could do that in a distributed fashion.

It could, however, be solved by a third party. If this is a problem that 
really has a market need, an independent service provider could provide a 
service whereby different sites register for a name, and a user expresses 
a preference for that name, and sites can just link to that service 
provider.

So instead of linking to Google or Yahoo!, you would link to this service 
provider with the key &quot;search&quot;, and it woudl redirect you as needed.


Since all these use cases can already be resolved, I haven't added 
anything to the spec.
