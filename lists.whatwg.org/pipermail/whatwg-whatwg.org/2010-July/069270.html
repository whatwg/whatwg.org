</I>&gt;<i> src = uri [CT] &#160; &#160; This attribute specifies the location of the image
</I>&gt;<i> resource. Examples of widely recognized image formats include GIF,
</I>&gt;<i> JPEG, and PNG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing in the definition here says &quot;the img tag only allows mime
</I>&gt;<i> types of image/*&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#attr-img-src">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#attr-img-src</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty
</I>&gt;<i> URL potentially surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive,
</I>&gt;<i> optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor
</I>&gt;<i> scripted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Images can thus be static bitmaps (e.g. PNGs, GIFs, JPEGs),
</I>&gt;<i> single-page vector documents (single-page PDFs, XML files with an SVG
</I>&gt;<i> root element), animated bitmaps (APNGs, animated GIFs), animated
</I>&gt;<i> vector graphics (XML files with an SVG root element that use
</I>&gt;<i> declarative SMIL animation), and so forth. However, this also
</I>&gt;<i> precludes SVG files with script, multipage PDF files, interactive MNG
</I>&gt;<i> files, HTML documents, plain text documents, and so forth.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While there is text in the html5 definition which precludes scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> it too doesn't explicitly limit the range to image/*, and in fact I
</I>&gt;<i> believe since the PDF mime type is application/pdf, it's safe to say
</I>&gt;<i> that browsers do render things which are not image/*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In testing, although Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Minefield (after bug
</I>&gt;<i> 276431) support image/svg+xml today none support application/svg+xml.
</I>&gt;<i> However, as Safari supports application/pdf, the cat's out of the bag
</I>&gt;<i> on non image/ mime types.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.webwizardry.net/~timeless/svg/276431.html">http://www.webwizardry.net/~timeless/svg/276431.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of the image formats that you are pointing out have an image mime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should have listed PDF which doesn't, mia culpa -- It is in the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 specification as a suggestion as noted above in this reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am merely pointing out that to support ogg theora browsers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would need to support a video mime type in an &lt;img&gt; element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You didn't point that out, you suggested that instead servers would
</I>&gt;<i> have to do content conversions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see that as the intention of the &lt;img&gt; element, in particular since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt; elements do not have transport controls and the like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> html5: &quot;An img element represents an image.&quot;, that's all the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> wants, an image, a non interactive image (possibly animated), and it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible to decode an ogg video in a way which achieves this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Otherwise, why did we create a &lt;video&gt; element in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#video">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#video</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> html5: &quot;A video element is used for playing videos or movies.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;User agents should provide controls to enable or disable the display
</I>&gt;<i> of closed captions, audio description tracks, and other additional
</I>&gt;<i> data associated with the video stream, though such features should,
</I>&gt;<i> again, not interfere with the page's normal rendering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User agents may allow users to view the video content in manners more
</I>&gt;<i> suitable to the user (e.g. full-screen or in an independent resizable
</I>&gt;<i> window). As for the other user interface features, controls to enable
</I>&gt;<i> this should not interfere with the page's normal rendering unless the
</I>&gt;<i> user agent is exposing a user interface. In such an independent
</I>&gt;<i> context, however, user agents may make full user interfaces visible,
</I>&gt;<i> with, e.g., play, pause, seeking, and volume controls, even if the
</I>&gt;<i> controls attribute is absent.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Video offers video controls, the suggestions which you were presented
</I>&gt;<i> were clearly instances where people just wanted animated frames
</I>&gt;<i> without such controls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I am just pointing out that with current &lt;img&gt; element
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementations and with the existing intentions of &lt;img&gt; elements (as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opposed to &lt;video&gt; elements), using a segment of Ogg Theora video as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined through a media fragment URI will not work as an image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource and will also not work as a video resource.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to support media fragments, media fragment support would have
</I>&gt;<i> to be implemented. This is obvious to everyone. Similarly, adding
</I>&gt;<i> support for ogg in &lt;img&gt; would require adding support for ogg in
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt;, just as adding support for svg in &lt;img&gt; requires adding support
</I>&gt;<i> for svg in &lt;img&gt;. Of note, since SVG is already supported by most
</I>&gt;<i> browsers, the incremental cost of adding svg support in &lt;img&gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> relatively low (as seen demonstrated by
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=276431">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=276431</A>&gt; which adds it to
</I>&gt;<i> Gecko).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is in contrast with the cost of adding media fragment support,
</I>&gt;<i> which is essentially entirely new code. But once it's there, the cost
</I>&gt;<i> of letting it work in an &lt;img&gt; tag would not be very high.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'm not saying it should be done, but you've chosen to ignore
</I>&gt;<i> how it could work and until your last reply suggested an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> which was not the intent of the person who made the proposal while
</I>&gt;<i> ignoring what seemed like a perfectly clear proposal. Again, I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> endorsing it.
</I>

I've not ignored anything. I have given my advice to the best of my
knowledge and a recommendation how to solve the use case in a
different technical manner than proposed, since in my opinion the
proposed solution is harder to implement. I am not the one making the
decisions here though - I can only provide input. You are free to
ignore my input and implement video support in the &lt;img&gt; element. I
just had to point out that a media fragment URI that is using &quot;#&quot; will
not return an image mime type, which was what the original question
seemed to imply.

Regards,
Silvia.
