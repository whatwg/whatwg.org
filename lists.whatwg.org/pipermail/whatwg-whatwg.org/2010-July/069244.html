&gt;<i> &gt; #4 is soluble 'on top of' HTML5 and the media formats, if needed.  Web Archives, Web Apps, and so on.  I think.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>Yes, &lt;iframe&gt;s, &lt;objec&gt;s and &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt;s should solve the problem of
embedding, and (if I understand the meaning of &quot;Encapsulation&quot; correctly)
&lt;html&gt; wrappers should solve encapsulation as well.

&gt;<i> &gt; #5 is a problem only if you care about phishing attacks...or indeed apps that have the gall to believe that you should be able to see nothing else when they are running.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We talked about this a week or two ago and the idea was to have a &quot;allow
</I>&gt;<i> full screen&quot; element in the video tag that makes a control that can be
</I>&gt;<i> used by the user to go full screen. The problem here is abuse but I
</I>&gt;<i> think the browser vendors should make some safeguards if this is the
</I>&gt;<i> route they take.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #6 is well, rather different from the problem of delivering a/v to a user.  I'm not enthusiastic about web pages that can listen to me or watch me, myself...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>Agreed, such access for web pages should be limited to &lt;input
type=file&gt;. That would require the user to &quot;go out of his way&quot; to grossly
violate his privacy rather than &quot;just clicking OK&quot; or being click-jacked
into approving of recording of himself (such as with interactive
JavaScripts and CSS'd images of hot women labeled &quot;Click here for more&quot;).

&gt;<i> Camera and mic access could be done in the spec IMO and it would be
</I>&gt;<i> useful. How its implemented would be interesting. For sites like
</I>&gt;<i> hotmail, gmail, youtube(for their webcam capture)..etc that have
</I>&gt;<i> integrated chat it would be very useful. Obviously in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> implementation they would have to safe guard by asking. Id look for
</I>&gt;<i> something as simple as &lt;webcam /&gt; or &lt;mic /&gt; or something and dont have
</I>&gt;<i> any parameters and allow the browser to work out what to do would be ok
</I>&gt;<i> to put in the spec. Its a little bit out there but I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> beneficial if its a blocker for some sites.
</I>Will &lt;webcam&gt; and &lt;mic&gt; be &lt;form&gt; elements, interactive content that can
go anywhere in a web page? If the latter, what whould HTML renderers
do with it? But you're probably thinking about &lt;device&gt;, save the no
@attrs suggestion.

I for one don't understand why this would be any better than (in the
case of &lt;form&gt; elements) &lt;input type=file accept=&quot;video/*&quot;|&quot;audio/*&quot;&gt;
and for more complex and esoteric use cases (i.e. &quot;webapps&quot;), the device
APIs from the DAP WG of W3C.
