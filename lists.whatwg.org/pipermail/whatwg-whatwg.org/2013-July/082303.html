</I>&gt;<i> exist, are all fantastic ways for developers to work on and fix problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***
</I>&gt;<i> But all that is ENTIRELY ORTHGONAL to what the developers are actually
</I>&gt;<i> presently asking from LABjs.
</I>&gt;<i> ***
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are asking, repeatedly, for the ability to have logic deployed in
</I>&gt;<i> their *production* builds, which sits in front of end users which have no
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of or relation to any developer tools in whatever browser they

</I>&gt;<i> don't care about devtools, and the developers who do care aren't actually
</I>&gt;<i> using the user's browser anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok, I think I understand what you're saying now.


&gt;<i> At this point, whether or not a browser has certain devtools is entirely
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant to what the developer wants from LABjs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What seems to be their mindset and internal narrative is this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OK, no matter how good we are at figuring out how to build a bug-free
</I>&gt;<i> app, we rely on third-party external resources that we don't control. We
</I>&gt;<i> cannot guarantee that our request for 'jquery.js' from the Google CDN will
</I>&gt;<i> actually work. It should work. It usually works. But it doesn't always
</I>&gt;<i> work. Sometimes Google goes down. Sometimes the DNS lookup fails. Sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> a proxy server misbehaves. Sh$$ happens. SO! We'll just accept that fact.
</I>&gt;<i> We look at our RUM logs and we see that about 2% of our users experience
</I>&gt;<i> one of these dead page loads. But, hey, I've got an idea, how about we try
</I>&gt;<i> to write code into our production code which detects when something like
</I>&gt;<i> that happens, and tries to gracefully recover, if possible, to maybe reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the 2% down to 1%. Yeah, that's a good idea. How do we do that? Oh, I know!
</I>&gt;<i> We're already using a script loader. Let's have that script loader tell us
</I>&gt;<i> when `script.onerror` fires, which tells us that a script load failed
</I>&gt;<i> (right!?!?), and we'll just re-request it from a fallback location on our
</I>&gt;<i> own CDN. Sounds like a plan. Can you file a feature request at LABjs for
</I>&gt;<i> them to expose when `script.onerror` fires? It'd be great if it just could
</I>&gt;<i> automatically re-try or fallback to another URL. Yeah, that sounds cool.
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, will do.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand clearly at this point that you don't agree with their
</I>&gt;<i> mindset. I understand you think their desire is misguided. I admit
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes I am skeptical of the efficacy of such efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's not scepticism at that level that I'm expressing. Accepting everything
you just typed out (AT EYE-WATERING-LENGTH), changes to Ian's proposal are
still a poor place to attack the issue. The Navigation Controller can give
you everything you want here and more. It's the right hammer for this
particular nail, not dependency attributes.


&gt;<i> But respectfully speaking, your opinion is not the only one that matters
</I>&gt;<i> here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who are we to tell some in-good-faith developer that they are objectively
</I>&gt;<i> WRONG to hope their script loader could not only LOAD scripts but RELOAD or
</I>&gt;<i> ALTLOAD scripts. Think about the conceptual and semantic there. It's a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sensible expectation for most non-browser-author devs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We'll be able to do this from the Navigation Controller:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/slightlyoff/NavigationController/blob/master/explainer.md">https://github.com/slightlyoff/NavigationController/blob/master/explainer.md</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Never heard of it before. Thanks for the link.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't see how the idea that this may (likely) happen (someday)
</I>

We're working on implementing it in Chrome. So yes, both likely and soon.


&gt;<i> automatically moots the discussion at hand. For you to fairly exercise
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of veto vote over what we discuss, which it seems like you're
</I>&gt;<i> trying to do, you've gotta come to the table with some real tangible thing
</I>&gt;<i> that's standardized (or clearly headed that way) and ready to evaluate for
</I>&gt;<i> fitness to the use-cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I glanced through (it's long, haven't digested it yet) and didn't
</I>&gt;<i> immediately see a section called &quot;RETRYING AND FALLBACK LOADING&quot;. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's unfair of you to expand the scope of a proposed feature to include
your pet issue when, logically, it can be separated. See what we both just
did there?

Better to ask *how best *to accomplish our goals, not fight over where to
do that. And that's the spirit I offered the NC in (and pour my work into
it over). Happy to discuss NC over at the github repo, FWIW.


&gt;<i> I don't see an MDN page entry for `Navigation Controller`.
</I>

And there's one for these new attributes here? Sorry, but rhetorical games
are not how you will win any fights here.


&gt;<i> I can't find &quot;Navigation Controller&quot; on <A HREF="http://caniuse.com">http://caniuse.com</A> yet. So far,
</I>&gt;<i> the only google result I've found for it is your writeup. So having only
</I>&gt;<i> seen it for a few moments as of the writing of this email, and finding no
</I>&gt;<i> other evidence about it, it's hard to judge if it's a valid alternative for
</I>&gt;<i> the requested use-cases or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you be able to make a gist showing how a script loader like LABjs
</I>&gt;<i> could use Navigation Controller's API to facilitate the retry/fallback
</I>&gt;<i> use-case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Short of such code, I'll take your word that eventually it might serve the
</I>&gt;<i> use-case. But that's about all I can clearly say thus far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I don't think that's strong enough evidence to swat down my use-case
</I>&gt;<i> or a present fair discussion of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, only the NC will have the power to really do that in userland.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's convenient for you to assert that ONLY this API will have that
</I>&gt;<i> control. But under what authority can you assert that no other mechanism in
</I>&gt;<i> the web platform could possibly ever serve the intended needs? Is there
</I>&gt;<i> some security mandate I'm unaware of which says only &quot;Navigation
</I>&gt;<i> Controller&quot; is trustworthy enough?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like Jake's proposal. I've expressed my distaste for it. If it's
</I>&gt;<i> based on something Ian suggested, I don't like Ian's suggestion either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's fair for me, in my examination of those proposals, to state things
</I>&gt;<i> that I (and other real world developers) would like to do, and point out
</I>&gt;<i> where those proposals might fall short of what we want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the crux of my questions presently:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither Ian nor Jakes proposal variations are CLEAR on if the
</I>&gt;<i> `dependencies` attribute would or would not be sensitive to failed loads
</I>&gt;<i> (or compile-time/run-time errors). Certainly there has to be AN ANSWER to
</I>&gt;<i> that question. Is it sensitive at all? If so, to what extent?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's be clear here. I'm not proposing we have such a mechanism whose
</I>&gt;<i> sensitivity is relevant. That's what Jake and Ian are proposing. I'm just
</I>&gt;<i> asking to clarify their proposal, so that I can evaluate if their proposal
</I>&gt;<i> meets my use-case needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***MY PROPOSAL*** is not really too concerned with those issues, because
</I>&gt;<i> in my proposal, I (the script loader) am fully in control of when the next
</I>&gt;<i> script is set eligible to execute, so I can detect whatever load or compile
</I>&gt;<i> or runtime errors I want, at any point, and if I want to, I can just NOT
</I>&gt;<i> EXECUTE THE NEXT SCRIPT. That gives me, the script loader, ultimate control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, that kind of complete flexibility in the hands of a developer is a
</I>&gt;<i> good win.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would humbly submit, Alex (and Ian and Jake), my proposal is far less
</I>&gt;<i> intrusive on the web platform, and far less pesky about such questions of
</I>&gt;<i> sensitivity, than the proposals you are advocating for. So if you're
</I>&gt;<i> annoyed that I would ask to clarify what those sensitivies may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> be, then perhaps you should just abandon those other proposals and support
</I>&gt;<i> mine, which makes those questions moot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's no need to complicate Ian's proposals (or argue against them) on
</I>&gt;<i> the basis of these use-cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree. I am advocating for the use-case on behalf of real-world
</I>&gt;<i> developers, who I care about. I think it's worth discussion. I apologize
</I>&gt;<i> that doing so seems to burden you.
</I>&gt;<i>
