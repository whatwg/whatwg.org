<PRE>
This thread was gigantic and involved many proposals. I've only included 
the last one below, since it seemed to take into account the most of the 
feedback mentioned on the thread; I haven't responded to all the 
intermediate e-mails which were mainly just a discussion amongst 
contributors, and not direct feedback on the spec itself.

I haven't yet changed the spec. The main thrust of the feedback below ends 
with the proposal to use WebGL's 'alpha' feature for the 2D context; is 
this what implementors want to do?

</I>&gt;<i> the pros and cons of each (correct me if I missed anything):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>  opaque attribute or matteColor property 
&gt;<i> pro:  fairly easy to implement
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  no performance hit over regular rendering
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  many opportunities for optimization
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  catches all in-canvas cases of color fringing
</I>&gt;<i> con:  does not handle any out-of-canvas color fringing
</I>&gt;<i> con:  opt-in
</I>|<i> con:  requires changes to canvas compositing spec and possibly  
</I>|<i>       implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> automatic opacity detection
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  catches most (all?) cases of in-canvas color fringing
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  some opportunties for optimization (must be conservative in some 
</I>&gt;<i>       cases)
</I>&gt;<i> con:  does not catch color fringing on CSS transforms, canvas -&gt; WebGL, 
</I>&gt;<i>       etc
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> context.textAntialising = { 'none', 'grayscale', 'subpixel' }
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  very easy to implement
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  no performance hit
</I>&gt;<i> con:  does not catch any cases of color fringing; completely up to web
</I>&gt;<i>       developer
</I>&gt;<i> con:  opt-in
</I>|<i> con:  requires specification and implementation of what happens when 
</I>|<i>       subpixel AA is drawn over transparent background.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> collect commands into a buffer, flush buffer only when compositing 
</I>&gt;<i> canvas to page, and decide on subpixel AA at that point.
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  catches all cases of color fringing
</I>&gt;<i> con:  in some cases, requires an infinite buffer (e.g., a canvas that 
</I>&gt;<i>       never clears, and only accumulates drawing frame-to-frame means 
</I>&gt;<i>       you must accumulate commands indefinitely)
</I>        or giving up and using grayscale at some point
&gt;<i> con:  difficult to implement (e.g., canvas-to-canvas drawImage(), etc)
</I>&gt;<i> con:  may introduce performance hit due to re-rendering with and without
</I>&gt;<i>       subpixel AA (in cases where you would rather have just gone 
</I>&gt;<i>       without)
</I>  con:  doesn't handle pixel manipulation cases (since you can't return
        two sets of pixels and you can't regenerate the stuff that script
        is generating based on the returned pixels)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> two buffers (one grayscale, one LCD AA)
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  handles all cases of color fringing
</I>&gt;<i> pro:  moderately easy to implement
</I>&gt;<i> con:  RAM (or VRAM) usage is doubled
</I>&gt;<i> con:  possibly-unnecessary performance hit
</I>&gt;<i> con:  must be opt-in

</I>&gt;<i> To me, the &quot;it breaks compositing&quot; argument falls into the &quot;doctor, it

Seems reasonable; who is implementing this?

</I>&gt;<i> But, there are other context creation attributes we'd like to see on a

</I>&gt;<i> buffered. This is a performance win since most browsers using GPU 
</I>&gt;<i> compositing need to copy the contents of the canvas when compositing.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, given we want more creation attributes and given WebGL already has a 
</I>&gt;<i> way to declare opaqueness why not follow the existing method and add

How about these, is anyone interested in implementing these?

No, it was removed because it had no spec.
