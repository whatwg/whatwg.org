I don't think &quot;the DOM&quot; and &quot;a bitmap API&quot; are the only points on the 
spectrum that we should discuss here.

Using canvas (2D or GL) to generate a traditional app (i.e. not a game) is 
a disaster. Here's a brief list of the ways doing this would suck:

Platform-native look and feel of widgets has to be reimplemented.
Platform-native accessibility bindings have to be reimplemented.
Platform-native scrolling behaviour of scroll areas have to be 
reimplemented.
Mouse placement of text carets has to be reimplemented.
Keyboard movement of text carets has to be reimplemented (possibly across 
lines, for multiline text input).
Scrolling of text fields has to be implemented (horizontally for long 
lines, vertically for multiline input).
Native features such as copy-and-paste have to be reimplemented.
Native features such as spell-checking have to be reimplemented.
Native features such as drag-and-drop have to be reimplemented.
Native features such as page-wide text search have to be reimplemented.
Native features specific to the user, for example custom text services, 
have to be reimplemented. This is close to impossible since each user 
might have different services installed, and there is an unbounded set of 
possible such services.
Bidirectional text editing has to be reimplemented.
For multiline text editing, line wrapping has to be implemented for all 
relevant languages.
Text selection has to be reimplemented.
Dragging of bidirectional text selections has to be reimplemented.
Platform-native keyboard shortcuts have to be reimplemented.
Platform-native input method editors (IMEs) have to be reimplemented.
Undo and redo functionality has to be reimplemented.
Accessibility features such as magnification following the caret or 
selection have to be reimplemented.


IMHO we should provide an API that addresses these needs while providing 
the performance of a non-DOM-backed immediate-ish mode API. It's not 
canvas. I'm not sure what it is, exactly.
