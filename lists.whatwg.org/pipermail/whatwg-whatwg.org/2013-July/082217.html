The problem is that we can't do (2) in _all_ cases, e.g. innerHTML on an 
&lt;svg&gt; can't possibly break out of the &lt;svg&gt; if it sees one of these tags, 
since that's the &quot;root&quot; of what is being parsed.

Given that, it's not clear that (2) is better than (1). (I agree that if 
we could actually always be consistent, it would be.)

Note that this isn't the only place like that.

   &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/table&gt;

...and:

   document.createElement('table').innerHTML = '&lt;div&gt;';

...result in very different DOMs (in the first, the &lt;div&gt; and the 
&lt;table&gt; are siblings; in the latter, the &lt;div&gt; is a child).


&gt;<i> In an ideal world it would be possible to grab any subsection of a 
</I>&gt;<i> document, parse that in isolation as a fragment, and get the same result 
</I>&gt;<i> as if it was parsed in its original document context. This is possible 
</I>&gt;<i> in XML, but not HTML, due to the existing &quot;author-friendly&quot; hacks, and 
</I>&gt;<i> making the parsing behaviour even more context sensitive doesn't seem 
</I>&gt;<i> like a good thing.
</I>
I think we're _so_ far beyond this ideal world that I'm not sure it's 
worth even looking for it, to be honest. :-)
