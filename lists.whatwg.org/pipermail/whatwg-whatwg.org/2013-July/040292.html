</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that would mislead authors into thinking that the UI that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; users will see is one that asks for a UTC time. That kind of UI is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the worst UI for this kind of feature, so that would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misleading.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd suggest &quot;datetime-absolute&quot; because the other variant is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; (to local politically decided time which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; may vary depending on future political decisions).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We could rename &quot;datetime&quot; to &quot;datetime-absolute&quot; and leave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;datetime-local&quot; as named, but I'm not really convinced that's much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; better than what we have now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it more common for people to interact mainly with people in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their own timezone. I.e. most time when talking about dates and times
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people don't mention what timezone is involved and rely on context to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide that information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that that is accurate for when people talk. But that's somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> misleading, I think, regarding what it implies about form controls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Web apps, there's basically three cases:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Cases where you mean a specific global time (a time relative to UTC),
</I>&gt;<i>    for coordination amongst people from many locations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      For example: the time that a broadcast begins
</I>&gt;<i>                     e.g. a live Hangout on G+
</I>&gt;<i>                   the time that a deliverable is due
</I>&gt;<i>                     e.g. the due date for a poetry contest
</I>&gt;<i>                   the time that a resource becomes available and the time
</I>&gt;<i>                     it stops being available, if scheduled in advance
</I>&gt;<i>                     e.g. the time that a meeting phone bridge code starts
</I>&gt;<i>                          working and the time it ends working
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Cases where you mean a specific global time (a time relative to UTC),
</I>&gt;<i>    but where the time is really only relevant for local purposes, and so
</I>&gt;<i>    when given is likely to be given relative to an implied time zone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      For example: the time that a plane takes off or lands
</I>&gt;<i>                   the time that a physical meeting (not one involving
</I>&gt;<i>                     video conferencing across multiple sites) begins
</I>&gt;<i>                   the time that someone wants to go home from work
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Cases where you mean a floating time and no time zone actually applies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      For example: a wake-up alarm on a phone (&quot;wake me up at 8am on
</I>&gt;<i>                     Monday&quot;, where the time zone isn't decided until
</I>&gt;<i>                     Monday, by examining where the user is)
</I>&gt;<i>                   the time for an event celebrated at different times in
</I>&gt;<i>                     different time zones, e.g. New Year's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, when implementing these, there's often mistakes made. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> authors will often confuse case 1 for case 2, and will often confuse case
</I>&gt;<i> 2 for case 3. That is, they will often assume a time zone when one should
</I>&gt;<i> not be assumed, and will often forget about time zones entirely when a
</I>&gt;<i> time zone should be assumed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, they may ask for the time that a broadcast begins, and then
</I>&gt;<i> just assume that the time zone is the time zone of the server. This would
</I>&gt;<i> work fine in a single-time-zone-company where the server is colocated with
</I>&gt;<i> the users. Similarly, they might ask for the time of a plane's departure,
</I>&gt;<i> and then display it in the user's time zone, forgetting that there's an
</I>&gt;<i> implied time zone given by the user's location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The opposite error is harder to make. It's harder to ignore the time zone
</I>&gt;<i> when all times that the user enters get converted to UTC -- unless you're
</I>&gt;<i> in the UK during the winter, or one of a handful of other countries using
</I>&gt;<i> UTC, you're likely to notice right away (and even in those, in many cases
</I>&gt;<i> you'll likely notice within 6 months).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because of this likelihood for mistakes, the controls are designed so that
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting a time zone requires more characters than giving one. Authors
</I>&gt;<i> are less likely to initially use datetime-local than datetime, so they're
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to be reminded to use time zones immediately, than they are to
</I>&gt;<i> forget to use time zones until too late.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So in most contexts when people think about a point in time, they do so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a specific timezone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how to evaluate if this is true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When that is not the case, this is something that people are aware of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I interact with friends/family/coworkers where the timezone is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obvious this is quite clear. And in these cases I'm aware that I need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specify timezone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know that that's the case. I think it's more likely that authors
</I>&gt;<i> will incorrectly forget to use time zones when they should have, than it
</I>&gt;<i> is for them to use time zones when they should not. That, as described
</I>&gt;<i> above, is the principle on which the spec's design was based.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I would imagine that when a developer sees &quot;datetime&quot; that does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include a timezone. Likewise, when a developer wants to ask the user for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a point in time which does include a timezone, that they would remember
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to ask for that explicitly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are not the only two situations. I think another major case is the
</I>&gt;<i> case where the author needs to ask for a globally specific time (i.e. a
</I>&gt;<i> time with a time zone), but without making a big fuss over the time zone.
</I>&gt;<i> That's the case for which &lt;input type=datetime&gt; is useful. I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> it is the most common case, but I would not be surprised if it was. (This
</I>&gt;<i> is case 1 in the list above.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two cases you list -- of asking for a time without a time zone, and of
</I>&gt;<i> asking for a time and an explicit time zone - are the cases for which
</I>&gt;<i> type=datetime-local is appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally, in many cases even when timezones are involved do UIs not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ask for the timezone as part of the date/time picker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. You likely shouldn't (by default) show a time zone in the
</I>&gt;<i> type=datetime UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When looking for airplane tickets the timezone is assumed to be that of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the departing location when talking about departing time, and that of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the arrival destination when talking about arriving time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When renting a car, the same thing applies, even if the car is picked up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and returned in different timezones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right; for those, you'd want datetime-local. There are definitely use
</I>&gt;<i> cases for both, I don't think anyone is disputing that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could name them in a variety of ways: datetime-local could instead be
</I>&gt;<i> named datetime, datetime-floating, datetime-without-timezone, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, datetime could have instead been named datetime-global,
</I>&gt;<i> datetime-utc, datetime-with-timezone, normalized-datetime,
</I>&gt;<i> specific-datetime... There's lost of options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In every case, there's a tradeoff made. If we name the one without time
</I>&gt;<i> zone normalisation &quot;datetime&quot;, then authors are likely to forget time
</I>&gt;<i> zones until it's harder to fix (as discussed above). If we name the one
</I>&gt;<i> with normalisation &quot;datetime-utc&quot;, author are likely to avoid it even when
</I>&gt;<i> it's appropriate, because it has a scary name. If we give both of them
</I>&gt;<i> long names, then authors never have the convenience of a short name. If we
</I>&gt;<i> give one a short name, then we run the risk of it being ambiguous and
</I>&gt;<i> confusing. These are all the normal tradeoffs we have to make whenever we
</I>&gt;<i> do language design; there's nothing especially unusual about this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even the calendar app that's on my device (the built-in calendar app for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Android 4.2) does not ask for timezone as part of the date/time picker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's important not to confuse the UI with the value space. I'm not 100%
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the Android date pickers (and they have changed over time).
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of HTML's, there's a picker that picks a floating time and
</I>&gt;<i> there's a picker that picks a specific time. They can in fact have the
</I>&gt;<i> same UI. The one with the time-zone normalisation _could_, in advanced
</I>&gt;<i> UAs, allow the user to pick an explicit time zone to give the time in, but
</I>&gt;<i> that time zone isn't then transmitted to the author. The one without
</I>&gt;<i> time-zone normalisation is in fact the one most likely to be used in UIs
</I>&gt;<i> that include explicit time zone pickers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the Android pickers are actually more equivalent to type=date +
</I>&gt;<i> time=time, rather than either form of type=datetime/datetime-local.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead a separate control is used where the user can choose what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; timezone the separately entered date/time is. This makes a lot of sense
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since timezones are easy to forget about and so having explicit and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate UI makes things more unlikely that the user will forget to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enter the information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the cases where the user is expected to explicitly enter the time zone,
</I>&gt;<i> the time zone is likely to need to be sent to the server, and you probably
</I>&gt;<i> want to use type=datetime-local with a &lt;select&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is actually required for repeating events since it's important to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know which timezone the user picked. I.e. there are two values entered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by the user: the date/time and the timezone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. The high-profile cases -- calendars and airline booking sites --
</I>&gt;<i> are actually two of the more complicated cases, and neither is likely to
</I>&gt;<i> use type=datetime. Having the more complicated cases use the more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated types is generally a good thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So first off I'm not convinced that the common case for date/time entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will include entering a timezone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, and type=datetime doesn't involve entering a time zone. The case
</I>&gt;<i> where you enter a time zone is generally going to use type=datetime-local.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second, I'm not convinced that even if the common case includes timezone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; entry, that this means that the intuitive behavior for a &quot;datetime&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; input type is to include UI for timezone entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Third, I think that even in many cases where timezones are involved,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the better UI is to have timezone entry separate from from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; date/time picker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not advocating that having a timezone aware date/time picker is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad idea. But I don't think it should be the &quot;default&quot; behavior. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might not even make it into the 80% set of use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think a time-zone-aware picker is the same as a datetime picker
</I>&gt;<i> that shows time-zone UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So at least we should make &quot;datetime&quot; refer to a timezone-agnostic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; picker. And then use &quot;datetime-global&quot; or &quot;datetime-absolute&quot; or some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such as a timezone aware picker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's two axes of time-zone-*ism: the data entry space, and the value
</I>&gt;<i> space. They are not the same, and I think that confusing them is leading
</I>&gt;<i> to a confusion regarding why the controls are named as they are.
