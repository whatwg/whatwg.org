</I>&gt;<i> such case, the host document should be able to specify something like 
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) I want to embed a seamless untrusted iframe here, and
</I>&gt;<i> (2) iframe should have maximum size of e.g. 480x240 pixels (or any size
</I>&gt;<i> set via CSS max-width/max-height). However, if user interacts (I guess
</I>&gt;<i> moving focus inside the iframe is enough) with the iframe, then
</I>&gt;<i> max-width and max-height are set to &quot;expanded state&quot; (whatever that means).
</I>
It's not clear to me why the host would need to control this with the UA's 
help. If you trust the embedded page to say when it needs to expand, which 
it seems you must for any but the most trivial of interaction models, then 
you can just trust the page to expand any time it wants. If you don't 
trust the page at all, it seems dangerous to embed it at all, since it can 
spoof you (it's a seamlessly embedded page, after all).

(You can set maximum dimensions using CSS, in any case -- the iframe is 
still just a regular block, so max-height applies.)


&gt;<i> Does there need to be any support for expendable seamless iframe without 
</I>&gt;<i> scripting?
</I>
I doubt it, but in principle I don't see why scripting would be needed.

I don't know. Using CORS-like headers seems misleading to authors, they 
might think that they work together.


&gt;<i> &gt; Then for the per-origin control, we would extend CSP to have a flag

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's already planned for CSP [...]
</I>
What progress has there been on the CSP front in terms of allowing a page 
to list which origins can embed it? That's the main missing link here; I'd 
really rather not reinvent CORS just for seamless iframes. (We can't use 
CORS itself, obviously, since that would grant reading privileges.)

The proposed solution for cross-origin iframes is still the solution 
proposed at the bottom of this e-mail:

</I>
The other problem with markup is that it's mutable, which means we'd have 
to define how and when it takes effect and how to react to changes, and 
there's typically difficulties with dealing with race conditions and it 
can be vulnerable to injection attacks. Working around these is possible; 
we did so to a great extent with manifest=&quot;&quot;, but it requires deep 
integration into things like the parser and navigation algorithms.

How would you propose to address the use cases instead?

(Having said that, if we don't forward events and styles, I don't think 
there's any problem with the rest of this relying on message passing. At 
that point it's only sizing, after all.)

I think you're misreading this. It's only referring to user interface, not 
to DOM APIs.

Both sites would be made vulnerable to each other, but if we make it so 
both sites have to explicitly opt-in to accepting the other site before 
the embedding could be seamless, this seems somewhat safe to me. It's 
unlikely that one site is going to want to be embedded in a hostile site, 
or vice versa, and explicitly allow it.

Unless we allow wildcard embeddings, in which case the embedded resource 
is at the mercy of hostile sites.

This would violate all kinds of assumption in the platform. For example, 
what localStorage could they read? What XMLHttpRequests could they 
perform? What domain would a WebSocket have to accept connections from?
Having the URL of the page not match its origin would lead to all kinds of 
issues, also. This sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.

But anyway, none of this is necessary. Even if the embedded page is in the 
same process, it can still be cross-origin, even in a system that usually 
isolates origins.
