</I>
The algorithms in the spec are great when it comes to defining things
with high level of exactness. However they only work well when the
implementations of those algorithms actually look like the algorithms
in the spec.

When they don't, the implementor has to read in all relevant
algorithms defined in the spec. Then map those algorithms into the
semantics and behavior they actually result in for the feature that
the implementor is working on implementing. Then map those semantics
and behaviors into an implementation that fits with existing code.

Generally speaking, it would be easier if the spec defined the
semantics and the behaviors instead. Thereby avoiding having to do the
initial algorithms-&gt;behavior mapping.

Another fix would of course be to rewrite implementations to match the
algorithms and concepts in the spec more precisely. Though that's a
very risky undertaking for something like navigation since the spec
probably isn't getting all edge cases right. Additionally the spec
doesn't deal with all the situations that at least Gecko has to deal
with (desktop shortcuts being clicked. Bookmarklets being clicked.
Commandlines being executed. Addons. Etc) which means that it might
not be possible to get the two to align very well.

That said, I totally understand that it's very hard to define behavior
to the level of exactness that's currently there, without writing the
spec the way it's currently written. But I believe that this is what's
making the spec hard to read.
