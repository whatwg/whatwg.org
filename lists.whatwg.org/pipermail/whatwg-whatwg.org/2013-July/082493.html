</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For Canvas, you should always add 0.5, since you're in the canvas
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> coordinate space, before the pixel ratio is applied.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That seemed like an OK idea until I thought about it some more.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doing a .5 scale will also affect your fills so a rect will now have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aliased borders.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I meant you always want to add 0.5 to offsets, not ratio / 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
sorry, that was a typo. I meant to say 'translate(.5, .5)' will offset your
fills.


&gt;<i> On a device with a pixel ratio of 2, you still want to add 0.5, not 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> You want to add 0.5 if you're drawing a 1px stroke, so the rect ends at
</I>&gt;<i> 0.5 and the stroke extends to the edge of the pixel at 0.  If you're
</I>&gt;<i> drawing a filled rect with no stroke, you don't want to add 0.5, so the
</I>&gt;<i> rect itself goes to the edge of the pixel rather than the stroke.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is very confusing. So, if there's a scale, you have to unapply the
scale to the .5 offset?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree this isn't all that obvious.  What if there was an option for
</I>&gt;<i> strokes to align themselves to the inside or outside of the path, instead
</I>&gt;<i> of centering over the path?  That way, drawing 5x5-10x10 would cause both
</I>&gt;<i> the stroke and the edge of the fill to be pixel-aligned.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> Photoshop's &quot;Position&quot; stroke option, which can be set to &quot;inside&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;outside&quot; or &quot;center&quot;.  I don't know if that makes sense with the way paths
</I>&gt;<i> work, and it would make the stroke's path dependent on its width.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's a cool feature, but doesn't solve the problem. Users would still
need to be aware that they need to align to whole pixels to stroke.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also adjusting for non-round device pixel ratio or as Kornel mentions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having transforms will still result in blurry lines (unless you do a bunch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of math)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean Canvas transforms or higher-level transforms, like CSS
</I>&gt;<i> scaling?  I don't think Canvas can help with the latter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Canvas transforms. I agree the resampling or transforming the canvas bitmap
after the fact is not something we can control.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Non-integer pixel ratios lead to all kinds of aliasing and quality
</I>&gt;<i> problems.  I suspect trying to fix them is futile...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A lot of people have zoom turned on and there are quite a few devices that
have non-integer pixel ratios. I'd like to solve the problem everywhere if
possible.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that we can't change this, but maybe we can add something to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In PDF there is a feature called &quot;strokeAdjust&quot; that will make the stroke
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> align to pixel boundaries. I've attached a drawing that shows the feature.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, if you turn it on and the stroke doesn't fill the entire pixel,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that pixel isn't drawn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apple has a Core Graphics function called &quot;CGGStateSetStrokeAdjust&quot; so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least they would be able to implement this easily. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't this simply disabling antialiasing?  That's what the illustration
</I>&gt;<i> seems to show.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It tells the renderer not to use over-scan but center-scan for strokes. I
was under the impression that GPU have centerscan by default and that
implementors have to add a bunch of code to work around this.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That'll work in certain cases, with the caveats that have been mentioned:
</I>&gt;<i> you don't want it when animating lines, for diagonals, if you have rounded
</I>&gt;<i> corners, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I *think* we still alias in certain cases. I will check.
