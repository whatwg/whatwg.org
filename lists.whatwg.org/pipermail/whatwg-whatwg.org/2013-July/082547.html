Fundamentally, I think we're going to have trouble if we try to use 
different fields in different places, and in particular if we use fields 
for specific localities. (That is, after all, why the &quot;given-name&quot; and 
&quot;family-name&quot; fields are bad.) Since we're not going to convince people to 
offer fields that are useless in most cases, we can't really add a boolean 
field just for France and its old colonies. Hence the convention to append 
CEDEX to the locality field. I think this is detectable enough that anyone 
doing data aggregation is going to have far fewer problems just filtering 
out the word &quot;CEDEX&quot; than they are dealing with any of the other data 
integrity issues (like the way people often use real towns instead of post 
towns in the UK, even when giving postal addresses).

Agreed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks Lara.  So if browsers ask for CEDEX as a separate optional

</I>
If they want a separate field, they can trivially just extract out the 
CEDEX bit by looking for the word CEDEX in the locality, and stripping it 
out if it's present. I would expect most implementations not to bother 
(since there doesn't seem to be any reason to -- just pretend the locality 
has &quot;CEDEX&quot; in the name, and it all works, no?).

</I>&gt;<i> use it to say &quot;please autocomplete with a physical location for this 
</I>&gt;<i> user&quot;. But just an idea. Just because you might have two localities: one 
</I>&gt;<i> which is your post-town, and one which is your actual physical location. 
</I>&gt;<i> But &quot;shipping&quot; might cover this sufficiently.
</I>
What's the use case?

Right now we have &quot;shipping&quot; and &quot;billing&quot; as possible grouping keywords; 
we can certainly add more if there are compelling use cases. I don't think 
I've ever seen a form that asks for a shipping address and a physical 
address, though. Or billing and physical that isn't shipping.

I just tried the Google address widget, and I have to be honest, I don't 
understand the way it uses the CEDEX field. It seems to be a free-form 
text field, which makes no sense to me.

Are we sure people in locales that use CEDEX won't find it more intuitive 
to add it after the locality, the way it is written on envelopes?
