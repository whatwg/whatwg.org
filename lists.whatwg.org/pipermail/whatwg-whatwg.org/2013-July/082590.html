Well, I agree with this.

I don't see any sense in making a document that is declared as ISO-8859-1 and encoded as ISO-8859-1 non-conforming. Just because the ISO-8859-1 code points are a subset of windows-1252? So is US-ASCII. Should an US-ASCII declaration also be non-conforming then -- even if the document only contains bytes from the US-ASCII range? What's the benefit?

I assume this is supposed to be helpful in some way, but to me it just seems wrong and confusing.
