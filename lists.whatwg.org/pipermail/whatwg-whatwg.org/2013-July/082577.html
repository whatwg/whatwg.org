<PRE>Ping --- I thought that there was sufficient agreement in this thread,
around the fact that supportsContext, as currently spec'd and currently
implementable, is a feature without a valid use case, that removing it from
the spec is the right thing to do at this point.

&gt;<i> The thread seems to have settled down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still believe that supportsContext, in its current form, should be
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the HTML spec, because as currently spec'd it could be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented as just returning whether WebGLRenderingContext is defined. I
</I>&gt;<i> also still believe that it will be exceedingly hard to spec supportsContext
</I>&gt;<i> in a way that makes it useful as opposed to just calling getContext.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Emails in this thread have conveyed the idea that it is already useful to
</I>&gt;<i> return whether WebGL is at least not blacklisted, regardless of whether
</I>&gt;<i> actual context creation would succeed. That, however, is impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> specify, and depends too much on details of how some current browsers and
</I>&gt;<i> platforms work:
</I>&gt;<i>  - driver blacklists will hopefully be a thing of the past, eventually.
</I>&gt;<i>  - on low-end mobile devices, the main cause of WebGL context creation
</I>&gt;<i> failure is not blacklists, but plain OpenGL context creation failures, or
</I>&gt;<i> non-conformant OpenGL behavior, or OOM'ing right after context creation.
</I>&gt;<i> For these reasons, justifying supportsContext by driver blacklisting seems
</I>&gt;<i> like encoding short-term contingencies into the HTML spec, which we
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't do. Besides, even if we wanted to do that, there would remain the
</I>&gt;<i> problem that that's impossible to spec in a precise and testable way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For these reasons, I still think that supportsContext should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> from the spec.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to question the usefulness of canvas.supportsContext. I tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think of an actual application use case for it, and couldn't find one. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also doesn't seem like any valid application use case was given on this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list when this topic was discussed around September 2012.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The closest thing that I could find being discussed, was use cases by JS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frameworks or libraries that already expose similar feature-detection APIs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, that only shifts the question to: what is the reason for them to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expose such APIs? In the end, I claim that the only thing that we should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognize as a reason to add a feature to the HTML spec, is *application*use cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So let's look at the naive application usage pattern for supportsContext:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   if (canvas.supportsContext(&quot;webgl&quot;)) {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     context = canvas.getContext(&quot;webgl&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that the same can be achieved with just the getContext
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call, and checking whether it succeeded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words, I'm saying that no matter what JS libraries/frameworks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may offer for feature detection, in the end, applications don't want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just *detect* features --- applications want to *use* features. So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they'll just pair supportsContext calls with getContext calls, making the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supportsContext calls useless.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is also the argument that supportsContext can be much cheaper than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a getContext, given that it only has to guarantee that getContext must fail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if supportsContext returned false. But this argument is overlooking that in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the typical failure case, which is failure due to system/driver
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blacklisting, getContext returns just as fast as supportsContext --- as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they both just check the blacklist and return. Outside of exceptional cases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (out of memory...), the slow path in getContext is the *success* case,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and again, in that case a real application would want to actually *use*that context.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Keep in mind that supportsContext can't guarantee that if it returns
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> true, then a subsequent getContext will succeed. The spec doesn't require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it to, either. So if the existence of supportsContext misleads application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers into no longer checking for getContext failures, then we'll just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have rendered canvas-using applications a little bit more fragile. Another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem with supportsContext is that it's untestable, at least when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> returns true; it is spec-compliant to just implement it as returning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether the JS interface for the required canvas context exists, which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite useless. Given such deep problems, I think that the usefulness bar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for accepting supportsContext into the spec should be quite high.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, is there an application use case that actually benefits from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supportsContext?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Benoit
