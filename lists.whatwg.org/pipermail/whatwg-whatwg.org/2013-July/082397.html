</I>
I've added height, width, and pixel density. Not sure what you meant by 
the other coordinates.

Because it might involve network I/O.

</I>&gt;<i> example).
</I>
Yeah, it's not supposed to be a replacement for drawImage().


&gt;<i> Is it async because it supports using Video and Blob as the source?
</I>
Mainly Blob, but maybe other things in the future.


&gt;<i> I really love the feature set (being able to pass ImageData in is going 
</I>&gt;<i> to be a huge boon - no more temporary canvases just to create images 
</I>&gt;<i> from pixel data!) but if it's async-only I don't know how useful it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be for the issues that led me to starting this discussion thread in the 
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>
Can you elaborate on the specific use cases you have in mind?

You return and wait for another frame.


&gt;<i> Furthermore, wouldn't that mean returning once to the event loop for 
</I>&gt;<i> each individual drawImage call you wish to make using a source rectangle 
</I>&gt;<i> - so for a single scene containing lots of dynamic source rectangles you

</I>
I don't understand. Why can't you prepare them ahead of time all together? 
(As in the example in the spec, for instance.)


&gt;<i> Each time you wait for that callback, won't any pending drawing 
</I>&gt;<i> operations to your canvas get flushed, resulting in the scene slowly 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering onscreen?
</I>
Right, don't draw anything until you're ready to draw it all.

What's the use case?

</I>
It's not. If you can use drawImage(), you should do so.

BitmapImage is mainly to have a way to send an &lt;img&gt; to a worker so you 
can draw images in a worker, since workers can't have &lt;img&gt; objects.

Nope. It is now added. Also density.


The density aspect of this might be pointless, given the failure of 
getImageDataHD(); if we're dropping that one, I'll drop this one at the 
same time.
