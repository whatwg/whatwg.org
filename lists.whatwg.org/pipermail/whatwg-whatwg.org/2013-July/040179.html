</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The only situation that might be reasonable would be a transform 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; on the Canvas that an author want to cover in the Path. But for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the rare case where this matters, you can create a new Path 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; object, add your path with the transform and call isPointInPath.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, you could do that too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Furthermore, a transform() function that applies to a Path object 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; seems to be useable as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; You can create a new Path, then add another Path to it while 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; applying a transform, using the addPath() method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yes, it is possible. But there are two reasons why I think that it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; still makes sense to use a transform function. First it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; natural to have a transform on Path object, like the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; CanvasRenderingContext2D already has. Both share a lot of functions, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; why disallow it for transforms?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The main reason I didn't add it to Path is because it led to a bit of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confusion in terms of what the transform applied to. Does it apply 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when you add points _to_ the path? Does it apply when you draw the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; path on another path or the canvas? Also, one of the more confusing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aspects of the canvas API is that you can change the coordinate space 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while adding lines to the path, and we had a whole era wherein 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemenations and the spec were confused as to what exactly happened 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when (did the points get transformed? Did the transform apply only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when you stroke? etc).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So in the new API I side-stepped the whole problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand. How did you sidestep the problem?
</I>
By not having a transform on Path.


&gt;<i> It is still confusing. for instance, reading the current spec, 
</I>&gt;<i> transforms happen before stroking in addPathByStrokingPath, but after 
</I>&gt;<i> stroking in addPathByStrokingText. Why is that?
</I>
That was just an oversight. Fixed. Thanks.


&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be easier to have API's that
</I>&gt;<i> - create a path with svg path data
</I>&gt;<i> - create a path with text (and a style)
</I>&gt;<i> - stroke a path with a style
</I>&gt;<i> - add a path with a optional transform
</I>
How does this differ from what we have? Do you just mean move the 
Text-based methods from being add*() methods to being Path constructors? I 
guess we could do that, I don't really see a compelling argument one way 
or the other. The current model is to use add*() for as much as possible; 
the only non-trivial constructors we have are a copy constructor, for 
convenience, and the SVG-based constructor, which is not an add*() method 
because I didn't want to try to explain how SVG path processing interacted 
with existing subpaths.


&gt;<i> We also should discuss what 'adding' a path means. Currently, the shapes 
</I>&gt;<i> are simply aggregated which will only work for simple cases.
</I>
Proposals welcome. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The interface of CanvasRenderingContext2D currently has a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder why this needs to be on the context interface. Wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it make more sense on the interface of Path object itself? If an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implementation really needs a context to get a point on a path 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it, it can create it on it's own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it would make _more_ sense, but I agree that it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; would make equal amounts of sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; In practice you're pretty much always going to have a context 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; around when you want to check this, because the reason you'd use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it is to see where I mouse click landed on a canvas. And you're 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; going to want the Path object transformed as per the transform on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the canvas, generally speaking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not necessarily. The path object makes sense outside of canvas as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; well. You don't need a context to create it so we are thinking of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; integrating it with SVG. It would increase interop and simplfy the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; API's if you could ask SVG elements for their path, or create them 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure, but with SVG you don't need to know if a point is in a path, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because the events get dispatched to the right path by the UA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That assumes that you always have an event handler attached to the path.
</I>
No, not at all. Even if the event handler is a global listener, it still 
gets the target information in the event object.


&gt;<i> This might not always be the case. For instance in a game, you might 
</I>&gt;<i> want to know what region of the character you hit.
</I>
I don't see how having a &quot;isPointInPath&quot; method on a Path object would 
help with that. You'd still need to have the path transformed; if this was 
canvas, you'd want to check each of the actual paths against the actual 
canvas (or more likely, use a hit region), if it was SVG, you'd check what 
the target of the event was.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Maybe if there was a 'currentpath' property on the 2d context, you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can move 'isPointInPath' to the path object. This would let you get 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rid of the extra 'isPointInPath' that takes a path too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   myContext.currentpath.isPointInPath(...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really see what problem this solves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It simplifies the API and gives you access to the current path.
</I>
I don't see how this is simpler. It's exactly as complex, as far as I can 
tell. I don't understand what being able to access the current path gives 
you. Not being able to access it doesn't seem, a priori, to be a problem.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I agree with Ian that there shouldn't be a method that changes the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; current points in a path. However, if there was a 'transform' 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; function that took a matrix and returned a transformed path, it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would do what Dirk wants. In addition, the path API's could be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; simplified since you can take out all the 'transform' arguments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you elaborate on the use case for this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Simplify the API's so they're easier to understand and implement.
</I>
I don't see how it simplifies the API for authors.

Could you elaborate on why it's simpler for implementors?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Would it make sense to have the canvas section defer to this spec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; for all blending, filtering, and compositing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think it does since then everyting will be in 1 location. I would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; need to update the blending spec for canvas because it behaves 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; differently than HTML and SVG.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, let me know when I should do this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a first draft posted here:

</I>
Ok, I've deferred to that. Implementors, if you don't want to implement 
this, please let me know. Rik, if the integration is not correct, let mek 
know.

</I>
This is one bit. I don't think it'll break the bank. It's cheaper than 
adding a new blend type.

I'm fine with doing this; since right now the spec just defers to Rik's 
spec, it'd be up to Rik to define the enum for me to hook into.

</I>
As specced today, it takes a single keyword, so an enum would work. To 
move it beyond that, we'd need to make sure we had implementor buy-in, and 
then we'd have to update the composition and HTML specs.
