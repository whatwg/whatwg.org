Agreed. Sorry to confuse the issue.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Canvas, you should always add 0.5, since you're in the canvas

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That seemed like an OK idea until I thought about it some more.
Doing a .5 scale will also affect your fills so a rect will now have
aliased borders.

Also adjusting for non-round device pixel ratio or as Kornel mentions,
having transforms will still result in blurry lines (unless you do a bunch
of math)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the same coordinate system used by OpenGL and Direct3D 10 (and
</I>&gt;<i> up), with pixels centered around 0.5x0.5.  That is, a pixel sits between
</I>&gt;<i> 0x0 and 1x1.  If you're specifying the center of the line (eg. where the
</I>&gt;<i> stroke grows outwards from), you need to add a half pixel.  (When you're
</I>&gt;<i> specifying a bounding box, such as drawImage, you don't, since you're at
</I>&gt;<i> the edge rather than the center of a pixel.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if there's a way to disable antialiasing for paths.
</I>&gt;<i> Disabling antialiasing to allow people to specify wrong coordinates only
</I>&gt;<i> seems like it would be more confusing, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Disabling it is not a solution. The 'crispEdges' option does this and the
results look bad.


&gt;<i> The only solution is to educate people about when and why they need to add
</I>&gt;<i> a half pixel; even if there was a way to avoid this in general (I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> sure there is, for an API with Canvas's functionality), it's much too late
</I>&gt;<i> to change this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that we can't change this, but maybe we can add something to make
it better.

In PDF there is a feature called &quot;strokeAdjust&quot; that will make the stroke
align to pixel boundaries. Basically, if you turn it on strokeAdjust and
the stroke doesn't fill the entire pixel, that pixel isn't drawn. If
there's less than a pixel total, you expand the stroke to at least a pixel.

Apple has a Core Graphics function called &quot;CGGStateSetStrokeAdjust&quot; so they
would be able to implement this easily. :-)
