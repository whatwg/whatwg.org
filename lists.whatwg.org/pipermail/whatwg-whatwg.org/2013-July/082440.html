Sure. Just like a DVR.

Um... no? The user should be in control. Always.

Right. Just like a DVR.

Indeed.

</I>
Obviously device limitations are difficult, but realistically, 
HTML-capable devices now regularly have gigabytes of storage available.

The spec doesn't require that the entire infinite stream be buffered, only 
as much as is possible; there's a whole bunch of prose about how to handle 
discarding content once the buffer is full (&quot;earliest possible position&quot; 
and so on).


&gt;<i> Even a DVR, however, won't always let you change the playback speed. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example it isn't possible to play at greater than 1x past the current 
</I>&gt;<i> time when watching a live stream.
</I>
Well obviously you can't fast-forward into the future, but you can pause 
and buffer some, or rewind if you've been watching for a while, and 
fast-forward through the buffer.


&gt;<i> If I am watching a live stream and I try to play past the end of the 
</I>&gt;<i> buffered video, my DVR drops back to 1x and won't let me change the 
</I>&gt;<i> speed. It doesn't automatically pause and buffer for a while so it can 
</I>&gt;<i> play at a faster rate.
</I>
Sure. That's fine. The spec has lots of prose that describes the 
requirements around how to handle playing content back when there's not 
yet content available to play back.


&gt;<i> It isn't always possible to play a media stream at an arbitrary speed. 
</I>&gt;<i> It is foolish to pretend otherwise as the current spec does.
</I>
If you can play it at 1x speed, then you can rewind and play it at 2x 
speed, or 0.5x speed. That's all the spec says.

Right.


&gt;<i> What if we added a &quot;supportedPlaybackRates&quot; attribute, which holds an 
</I>&gt;<i> array of playback rates supported by the server, plus (optionally) any 
</I>&gt;<i> rates the user agent can support due to the currently buffered data 
</I>&gt;<i> (possibly requiring that the user agent have enough data buffered to 
</I>&gt;<i> play at that speed for some amount of time).
</I>
Wouldn't that be 0.0 .. Infinity, basically?
