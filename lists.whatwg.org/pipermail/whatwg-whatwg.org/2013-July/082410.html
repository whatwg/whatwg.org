</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
By 'the other coordinates' I mean that if you constructed it from a
subrectangle of another image (via the sx, sy, sw, sh parameters) it would
be good to expose *all* those constructor arguments. This allows you to
more easily maintain a cache of ImageBitmaps without additional bookkeeping
data.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, it's not supposed to be a replacement for drawImage().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is why I was confused then, since I was told on this list that
ImageBitmap was a solution for the problem of drawing subrectangles of
images via drawImage (since the current specified behavior makes it
impossible to precisely draw a subrectangle). :(


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it async because it supports using Video and Blob as the source?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mainly Blob, but maybe other things in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really love the feature set (being able to pass ImageData in is going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be a huge boon - no more temporary canvases just to create images
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from pixel data!) but if it's async-only I don't know how useful it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be for the issues that led me to starting this discussion thread in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you elaborate on the specific use cases you have in mind?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The use case is being able to draw lots of different subrectangles of lots
of different images in a single frame.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand. Why can't you prepare them ahead of time all together?
</I>&gt;<i> (As in the example in the spec, for instance.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can, it's just significantly more complicated. It's not something you
can easily expose in a user-consumable library wrapper either, since it
literally alters the execution model for your entire rendering frame and
introduces a pause for every group of images that need the use of temporary
ImageBitmap instances. I'm compiling classic 2D games to JavaScript to run
in the browser, so I literally call drawImage hundreds or thousands of
times per frame, most of the calls having a unique source rectangle. I will
have to potentially construct thousands of ImageBitmaps and wait for all
those callbacks. A cache will reduce the number of constructions I have to
do per frame, but then I have to somehow balance the risk of blowing
through the entirety of the end user's memory (a very likely thing on
mobile) or create a very aggressive, manually flushed cache that may not
even have room for all the rectangles used in a given frame. Given that an
ImageBitmap creation operation may not be instantaneous this really makes
me worry that the performance consequences of creating an ImageBitmap will
make it unusable for this scenario.

(I do agree that if you're building a game from scratch for HTML5 Canvas
based on the latest rev of the API, you can probably design for this by
having all your rectangles known in advance - but there are specific
rendering primitives that rely on dynamic rectangles, like for example
filling a progress bar with a texture, tiling a texture within a window, or
scrolling a larger texture within a region. I've encountered all these in
real games.)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each time you wait for that callback, won't any pending drawing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operations to your canvas get flushed, resulting in the scene slowly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rendering onscreen?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, don't draw anything until you're ready to draw it all.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the use case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Use case is explained above. To be clear, I think this is essential because
it is a synchronous operation (this form of ImageBitmap could potentially
not even involve a copy, though I understand if for some reason you can't
provide that) and it's an operation that is extremely common in
performance-sensitive 2D rendering. To me, the GC pressure from ImageBitmap
instances is bad enough; adding an event loop turn and a copy and
potentially another decode is just plain ridiculous. It'll force people to
go straight to WebGL, which would be a shame (especially due to the
compatibility penalty that results from that.)

Yeah, I thought you were aware that this came up because I *can't* use
drawImage, and it turned out from discussion that it was impossible (or
undesirable) to fix the problems with drawImage.


&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Didn't realize about the worker constraint, that makes sense.
