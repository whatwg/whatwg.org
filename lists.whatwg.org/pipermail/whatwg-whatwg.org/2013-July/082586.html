Fair enough.


&gt;<i> (FWIW, I wouldn't change a server to say windows-1252.  The ISO spec is

</I>
It certainly seems that that is how most software interprets it.

Right. I note that you omitted to quote the following from my original 
e-mail: &quot;Previously, this was also somewhat the case, but it was only an 
error to use ISO-8859-1 in a manner that was not equivalent across both 
encodings (there was the concept of &quot;misinterpreted for compatibility&quot;). 
This was removed with the move to the Encoding spec.&quot;

This kind of error handling is what I would personally prefer.


&gt;<i> You might say that such pages are risky and the risk should be announced,
</I>&gt;<i> because if the page is later changed so that contains a byte in that range, it
</I>&gt;<i> will not be interpreted by ISO-8859-1 but by windows-1252.
</I>
Honestly merely not using UTF-8 is far more risky than the difference 
between 8859-1 and 1252. The encoding of the page is also the encoding 
used in a bunch of outgoing (encoding) features, and users aren't going to 
conveniently limit themselves to the character set of the encoding of the 
page when e.g. submitting forms.


&gt;<i> I think the simplest approach would be to declare U+0080...U+009F as 
</I>&gt;<i> forbidden in both serializations.
</I>
I don't see any point in making them non-conforming in actual Win1252 
content. That's not harmful.


&gt;<i> &gt; It seems bad, and maybe rather full of hubris, to make it conforming 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use a label that we know will be interpreted in a manner that is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; willful violation of its spec (that is, the ISO spec).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In most cases, there is no violation of the ISO standard. Or, to put it 
</I>&gt;<i> in another way, taking ISO-8859-1 as a synonym for windows-1252 is fully 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with the ISO 8859-1 standard as long as the document does not 
</I>&gt;<i> contain data that would be interpreted by ISO 8859-1 as C1 Controls 
</I>&gt;<i> (U+0080...U+009F), which it should not contain.
</I>
It's still a violation.

I'm not saying we shouldn't violate it; it's clearly the right thing to 
do. But despite having many willful violations of other standards in the 
HTML standard, I wouldn't want us to ever get to a stage where we were 
casual in our violations, or where we minimised or dismissed the issue.


&gt;<i> &gt; I would rather go back to having the conflicts be caught by validators 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than just throw the ISO spec under the bus, but it's really up to you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Henri, and whoever else is implementing a validator).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider a typical case. Joe Q. Author is using ISO-8859-1 as he has 
</I>&gt;<i> done for years, and remains happy, until he tries to validate his page 
</I>&gt;<i> as HTML5. Is it useful that he gets an error message (and gets 
</I>&gt;<i> confused), even though his data is all ISO-8859-1 (without C1 Controls)? 
</I>
No, it's not. Like I said, I would rather go back to having the conflicts 
be caught by validators.


&gt;<i> Suppose then than he accidentally enters, say, the euro sign &#8220;&#8364;&#8221; because 
</I>&gt;<i> his text editor or other authoring tool lets him do &#8211; and stores it as 
</I>&gt;<i> windows-1252 encoded. Even then, no practical problem arises, due to the 
</I>&gt;<i> common error handling behavior, but at this point, it might be useful to 
</I>&gt;<i> give some diagnostic if the document is being validated.
</I>
Right.

Unfortunately it seems you and I are alone in thinking this.


&gt;<i> I would say that even then a warning about the problem would be sufficient,
</I>&gt;<i> but it could be treated as an error
</I>
There's not really a difference, in a validator.


In any case, I've changed the spec to allow any label to be used for an 
encoding.
