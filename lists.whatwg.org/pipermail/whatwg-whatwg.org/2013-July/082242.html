</I>&gt;<i> My proposal was to standardize what IE4-10 did, which is to start loading
</I>&gt;<i> a script even if it's not in the DOM, but not execute it until it's in the
</I>&gt;<i> DOM. Then, you monitor an event to know if one or more scripts have
</I>&gt;<i> finished this &quot;preloading&quot;, and then you can decide if and when and in what
</I>&gt;<i> order to add the corresponding &lt;script&gt; elements to the DOM to allow
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;execution&quot; to proceed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The IE4-10 technique is invisible to pre-parsers, if we're chasing
performance here it's not good enough.


&gt;<i> Setting aside IE's non-standard event mechanism, Nicholas' proposal was
</I>&gt;<i> also perfectly sensible, and pretty simple. He suggested the same mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> for execution (adding a &lt;script&gt; to the DOM), but suggested a `preload`
</I>&gt;<i> attribute on the element to prevent auto-execution, and a `onpreload` event
</I>&gt;<i> to notify you of loading-complete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Also invisible to preloaders.

You could make &quot;preload&quot; an attribute which does a non-blocking download
but not execution. This is visible to preloaders and falls back to standard
ordered blocking loading which is fine. Then you'd have a method to
trigger execution of the script later. This is Hixie's &quot;whenneeded&quot;
proposal.

However, &quot;whenneeded&quot; is more complex than &quot;dependencies&quot;. Unless there's a
good use-case for deferred parsing that can't be handled by
link[rel=subresource] and similar, &quot;dependencies&quot; is the better option.

&gt;<i> 1. Add a &quot;dependencies&quot; attribute to &lt;script&gt; that can point to other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   scripts to indicate that execution of this script should be delayed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   until all other scripts that are (a) earlier in the tree order and (b)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   identified by this attribute have executed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;script id=&quot;jquery&quot; src=&quot;jquery.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;script id=&quot;shims&quot; src=&quot;shims.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;script dependencies=&quot;shims jquery&quot; src=&quot;myscript.js&quot; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230;content-management-systems (through plugins) load different items into a
</I>&gt;<i> page independently of other plugins. Those plugins have no knowledge of the
</I>&gt;<i> complete content/markup-structure of the page&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If &quot;dependencies&quot; took a CSS selector it could be:

&lt;script dependencies=&quot;.cms-core&quot; src=&quot;cmd-plugin.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Now the number of scripts with class &quot;cms-core&quot; can change between versions
of the CMS but the plugin still waits for them all. No ID generation
needed. Does this fix the issue for you?


&gt;<i> Moreover, this ignores some use-cases for &quot;script preloading&quot; which are
</I>&gt;<i> basically speculative preloading. I may want to load several plugins, but
</I>&gt;<i> not execute any of them, and then only use one of them depending on what
</I>&gt;<i> the user does.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This can be better achieved with things like link[rel=subresource] which
work for more than just scripts. When the script is required, it can be
added to the page with js, using something like LabJS or the &quot;dependencies&quot;
attribute to control execution order if necessary.


&gt;<i> So, the real need here is NOT just to chain a set of scripts together, but
</I>&gt;<i> to put the author in control of pausing a script between load and execute,
</I>&gt;<i> and then they get to decide when/if they unpause a script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Given the above, is there a usecase that isn't catered for by
&quot;dependencies&quot; and existing preloading features?


&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Add an &quot;whenneeded&quot; boolean content attribute&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't solve the &quot;I need an event to know when load is finished&quot;. If
</I>&gt;<i> I'm waiting for a bunch of stuff to load before asking any of them to
</I>&gt;<i> execute (in the order I want), I need a way to know that each of them are
</I>&gt;<i> in fact fully loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sorry to keep being Mr Use-case, but what do you need to do that isn't
catered for? You can call markNeeded() when you want the script executed &amp;
both a promise and the script's &quot;load&quot; event will tell you when it's done.
Why would you need to know when it's downloaded but not executed?


&gt;<i> Secondly, it seems like a bit more complex version of Nicholas' proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> with just different names. Not sure why the complecting of API with
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly) his same semantics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
To me, it seems like a simplification of Nicholas' proposal, but still more
complicated than &quot;dependencies&quot; without good reason. Also, it works with
preparsers. Can you provide a comparison that shows another suggestion to
be simpler than both of Hixie's proposals and match/beat it's performance?
