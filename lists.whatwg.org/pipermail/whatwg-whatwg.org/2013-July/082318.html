&gt;<i> Again: my question (which remains unanswered), &amp; the reason I stated the
</I>&gt;<i> error/retry/fallback use case in detail, is whether or not the dependency
</I>&gt;<i> attributes proposal, as put forth by Jake (and Ian) will or will not,
</I>&gt;<i> factually speaking, have any sensitivity to the error conditions (network
</I>&gt;<i> load error, compile error, run-time error) or not, or somewhere in between?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As per the existing outline, I don't see how it could have any
&quot;sensitivity&quot;.


&gt;<i> If `dependencies` IS sensitive, in any way, then it clearly overlaps
</I>&gt;<i> Navigation Controller, right? That may or may not be a good thing. If OTOH
</I>&gt;<i> it has no sensitivity whatsoever, and it will trigger a subsequent waiting
</I>&gt;<i> resource regardless of ANY particular network condition or result, that is
</I>&gt;<i> vital information to know, as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, shouldn't we afford enough discussion here to discuss how
</I>&gt;<i> little or how much, or if at all, that sensitivity would be? I certainly
</I>&gt;<i> can't adequately judge the proposal in the absence of that information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't it fair enough for me to inquire as to the actual nature of their
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, given that they've asserted in no uncertain terms that it is
</I>&gt;<i> fully sufficient for all my use-cases? Aren't I entitled to examine that
</I>&gt;<i> with the assistance and participation of this list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None of that means I necessarily think that Navigation Controller is or is
</I>&gt;<i> not ALSO suitable. I have no opinion on that yet. I stated the reasons why
</I>&gt;<i> I have no opinion on it yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presenting an alternate proposal for one or more use-cases, as you have
</I>&gt;<i> done, is fine. But that doesn't mean that it answers the questions I have
</I>&gt;<i> about the other proposal, by Jake and Ian. Those pre-existing questions are
</I>&gt;<i> my concern, presently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're working on implementing it in Chrome. So yes, both likely and soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I look forward to seeing more great documentation on it as we've all come
</I>&gt;<i> to appreciate from the Chrome and Developer relations teams.
</I>

I owe this list (and others) mail about it. Hoping to have that ready soon.


&gt;<i> &gt; It's unfair of you to expand the scope of a proposed feature to include
</I>&gt;<i> your pet issue when, logically, it can be separated. See what we both just
</I>&gt;<i> did there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Expand the scope? I am not expanding the scope beyond that which I've
</I>&gt;<i> pushed for over and over again for 3+ years, this thread just being the
</I>&gt;<i> latest incarnation. That others (like you) may come to this list with a
</I>&gt;<i> pre-conceived notion of what is and is not &quot;in scope&quot; doesn't mean that me
</I>&gt;<i> stating (in response to repeated appeals from Jake and others) at length
</I>&gt;<i> the use-cases *I* care about is actually &quot;expanding&quot; that scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think you missed the second sentence...


&gt;<i> Moreover, I am the originator, or at least one of them, of the &quot;proposed
</I>&gt;<i> feature&quot;, so I hardly think it's fair for you assert that I'm changing the
</I>&gt;<i> game. In reality, I'm clarifying the &quot;proposed feature&quot; as it relates to my
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoint, as an interested party acting in good faith. I'm recounting the
</I>&gt;<i> substantial &quot;prior art&quot; in the discussions and discovery and
</I>&gt;<i> experimentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I'm not expanding the scope. You (and others) appear to want to be
</I>&gt;<i> narrowing the scope that well pre-dates this thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My scope (as it always has been) put simply: I want (for all the reasons
</I>&gt;<i> here and before) to have a &quot;silver bullet&quot; in script loading, which lets me
</I>&gt;<i> load any number of scripts in parallel, and to the extent that is
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable, be fully in control of what order they run in, if at all,
</I>&gt;<i> responding to conditions AS THE SCRIPTS EXECUTE, not merely as they might
</I>&gt;<i> have existed at the time of initial request. I want such a facility because
</I>&gt;<i> I want to continue to have LABjs be a best-in-class fully-capable script
</I>&gt;<i> loader that sets the standard for best-practice on-demand script loading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Better to ask how best to accomplish our goals, not fight over where to
</I>&gt;<i> do that. And that's the spirit I offered the NC in (and pour my work into
</I>&gt;<i> it over). Happy to discuss NC over at the github repo, FWIW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. That spirit is certainly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the request of this list, I presented the use-cases as they stand, and
</I>&gt;<i> as they always have. Any solution(s) which reasonably meet them would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good candidate. We're seeking solutions, but we're doing so by exploring
</I>&gt;<i> the fitness of various proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the years, I've championed no fewer than 3 different proposals for
</I>&gt;<i> how I see a single coherent solution that solves all the use cases. That
</I>&gt;<i> alone ought to demonstrate sufficient good-faith that I'm looking for
</I>&gt;<i> solutions, not impetuously defending my &quot;pet&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, especially with this most recent proposal (&lt;script preload&gt;), I
</I>&gt;<i> believe it not only sufficient to (trivially) handle *all* the use-cases
</I>&gt;<i> I've presented, but also it is of the nature that it basically would answer
</I>&gt;<i> nearly any other use-case you could imagine in script loading. Certainly my
</I>&gt;<i> list is long but not fully exhaustive of every niche need/desire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In light of my proposal(s), none of which have been substantially refuted
</I>&gt;<i> as inferior, I of course am advocating for whatever solution we end on to
</I>&gt;<i> actually handle all the things my proposal would handle. Any proposal which
</I>&gt;<i> substantially does not is, in my opinion, insufficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may want to contract the scope to leave some of my use-cases out of
</I>&gt;<i> luck, but I'm entitled to avidly defend why I think that's unfair and the
</I>&gt;<i> wrong approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not married to my current proposal. If there is a single coherent
</I>&gt;<i> solution, or some reasonable combination of them, which clearly will handle
</I>&gt;<i> all the use-cases, and we can examine and compare WITH CODE (not just
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical ideas), as Jake suggests, great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But thus far, Navigation Controller is far behind the proposals of
</I>&gt;<i> `&lt;script preload&gt;` and `&lt;link rel=subresource&gt; + &lt;script dependencies=..&gt;`
</I>&gt;<i> in terms of being able to compare use-case coverage with actual practical
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's only your ignorance speaking. There are examples in the repo which
you can use to extrapolate examples, or if you a code snippet showing the
problem, either Jake or I can show how NC would address it.


&gt;<i> I look forward to you helping remedy that. :)
