It still looks wrong to me.

Take <A HREF="http://jsbin.com/ifihex/1/edit">http://jsbin.com/ifihex/1/edit</A> - the image on this page receives
a valid &amp; full HTTP request, but the received data isn't valid image
data (it's html).

Starting from <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#update-the-image-data,">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#update-the-image-data,</A>
here's how I see the image loading according to the spec

(everything seems fine until step 14)

Step 1: img set to unavailable state
Step 2: not applicable, no current fetch happening
Step 3: not applicable, no current image data
Step 4: not applicable, images are enabled &amp; supported
Step 5: selected source becomes &quot;/&quot;
Step 6: last selected source becomes &quot;/&quot;
Step 7: selected source becomes &quot;<A HREF="http://jsbin.com/">http://jsbin.com/</A>&quot;
Step 8: key set to tuple
Step 9: not applicable, key not in list of available images, it's the
only image on the page
Step 10: await stable state
Step 11: not applicable, no further images are added
Step 12: not applicable, selected source is &quot;<A HREF="http://jsbin.com/">http://jsbin.com/</A>&quot; not null
Step 13: fire loadstart on img
Step 14:
* delay document load event until image fetch completes
* fetching image
* set image to partially available
* I don't know if progress events are fired here or not, given the
invalid image data
* image fetched
* this is the point where I start to get lost, I'm not sure which
else-like statements (as in &quot;On the other hand&quot; and &quot;Otherwise&quot;) are
linked to which if-like statements
* unable to determine image's width or height due to invalid data, so
we fall to the &quot;Otherwise&quot; section (the one with the \21AA before it)
* set img to broken state
* fire load
* fire loadend
* resource isn't multipart/x-mixed-replace, so skipping that bit
* &quot;Otherwise, either the image data is corrupted in some fatal way&quot;
what's this an &quot;otherwise&quot; to, should these steps be followed? If so&#8230;
* image dimensions cannot be determined, so set img element to the
broken state (it already is)
* fire error
* fire loadend (for a second time)

So the order of events is load, loadend, error, loadend. I guess I'm
reading it wrong but unsure where.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;load&quot; is fired once the width &amp; height can be determined, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggests that an un-decodable image, but with intact headers (which give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the width &amp; height) will fire &quot;load&quot; but not &quot;error&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree with this, as it means the browser can defer decoding to render
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, but do we need a way in JS to confirm an image is decodable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the use case? (Surely the server should check this on the server.)
</I>
Hah, yeah, that bit was a bit of an afterthought, maybe best for another thread.

The use-case would be image loading that happened without a server.
Eg, an in-browser Photoshop that operated without user interaction.
User selects file on their machine, it has correct headers so fires a
load event, but cannot be painted onto the canvas (or paints
incorrectly) due to corrupt data. The in-browser app is unable to
detect the image is corrupt without building a decoder/validator in
JS.

Jake.
