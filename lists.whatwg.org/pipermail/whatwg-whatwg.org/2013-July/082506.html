</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sorry, that was a typo. I meant to say 'translate(.5, .5)' will offset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your fills.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (All I meant in the first place was that the pixel ratio isn't a factor
</I>&gt;<i> here.  Maybe it's SVG that needs the ratio-dependent adjustment.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is very confusing. So, if there's a scale, you have to unapply the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scale to the .5 offset?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there's a scale, the width of the stroke is going to be scaled too.  In
</I>&gt;<i> that case, you either have to do adjustments across the board (no
</I>&gt;<i> translation is going to make a 0.9-pixel stroke fill a pixel), or you need
</I>&gt;<i> to do something like disabling antialiasing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I agree this isn't all that obvious.  What if there was an option for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> strokes to align themselves to the inside or outside of the path, instead
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of centering over the path?  That way, drawing 5x5-10x10 would cause both
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the stroke and the edge of the fill to be pixel-aligned.  This is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Photoshop's &quot;Position&quot; stroke option, which can be set to &quot;inside&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;outside&quot; or &quot;center&quot;.  I don't know if that makes sense with the way paths
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work, and it would make the stroke's path dependent on its width.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a cool feature, but doesn't solve the problem. Users would still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to be aware that they need to align to whole pixels to stroke.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It solves the problem that it's a bit of a pain to have to supply
</I>&gt;<i> edge-aligned coordinates when you're filling and centered coordinates when
</I>&gt;<i> you're using a 1px stroke.  It eliminates the need to do any half-pixel
</I>&gt;<i> offsetting at all in a lot of cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you mean Canvas transforms or higher-level transforms, like CSS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scaling?  I don't think Canvas can help with the latter.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Canvas transforms. I agree the resampling or transforming the canvas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bitmap after the fact is not something we can control.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Non-integer pixel ratios lead to all kinds of aliasing and quality
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problems.  I suspect trying to fix them is futile...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A lot of people have zoom turned on and there are quite a few devices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that have non-integer pixel ratios. I'd like to solve the problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everywhere if possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If zoom is on, then that's the above: a compositing-stage transform that
</I>&gt;<i> happens after rendering, which Canvas probably can't help with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a non-integer pixel ratio, and no &quot;HD&quot; canvas backing store
</I>&gt;<i> (it sounds like those may be getting dropped), then that seems like the
</I>&gt;<i> same issue: the canvas will be rescaled at compositing time and there's
</I>&gt;<i> nothing Canvas itself can do to prevent blurriness.  (The developer could
</I>&gt;<i> still work around it by hand, by using a higher-resolution Canvas so the
</I>&gt;<i> backing store doesn't actually get resized at compositing time.  They'll
</I>&gt;<i> need to do this anyway, or everything will be blurry, not just strokes.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that's what I had in mind: the developer detects the device pixel
ratio and scales up the canvas so the pixels match.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  In PDF there is a feature called &quot;strokeAdjust&quot; that will make the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stroke align to pixel boundaries. I've attached a drawing that shows the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feature. Basically, if you turn it on and the stroke doesn't fill the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entire pixel, that pixel isn't drawn.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Apple has a Core Graphics function called &quot;CGGStateSetStrokeAdjust&quot; so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at least they would be able to implement this easily. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't this simply disabling antialiasing?  That's what the illustration
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems to show.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It tells the renderer not to use over-scan but center-scan for strokes. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was under the impression that GPU have centerscan by default and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementors have to add a bunch of code to work around this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't follow the terminology, but from your image and description (&quot;If
</I>&gt;<i> there's less than a pixel total, you expand the stroke to at least a
</I>&gt;<i> pixel&quot;, that sounds like disabling antialiasing (maybe only for certain
</I>&gt;<i> lines).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's more that the pixel is shrunk but is clamped to at least 1 pixel.

I asked our rendering people and it sounds like the feature is implemented
quite as described in the book. I'm still trying to find out the details...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That'll work in certain cases, with the caveats that have been
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mentioned: you don't want it when animating lines, for diagonals, if you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have rounded corners, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I *think* we still alias in certain cases. I will check.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could get more complex and turn off antialiasing for lines that aren't
</I>&gt;<i> exactly vertical or horizontal.  I suspect that would cause odd issues; for
</I>&gt;<i> example, seams at the boundary between a horizontal line and a rounded
</I>&gt;<i> edge, or a rounded edge being dimmer than the hard edges it connects.  (I
</I>&gt;<i> also don't know enough about paths and their implementations to know how
</I>&gt;<i> feasible this is.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, it's quite complex.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds complex and with its own problems, and the only case where it
</I>&gt;<i> might help is if you want to draw hard lines after calling
</I>&gt;<i> canvas.scale(0.9, 0.9), which seems uncommon to me.  In all typical cases,
</I>&gt;<i> being able to set strokes to inside or outside seem to handle the rest (if
</I>&gt;<i> that's something that fits in Canvas's path design; I don't know the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm).
</I>&gt;<i>
