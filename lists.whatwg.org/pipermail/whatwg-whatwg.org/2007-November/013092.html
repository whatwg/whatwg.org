</I>
Sure, but I don't see how it's different from &lt;label&gt; in that respect: 
we want to encourage authors to put &lt;label&gt; near the control to which 
it applies, but &lt;label&gt; already has for=. (&lt;label&gt; can have weak 
semantic value even when not related to a particular control, but then 
so could rel=&quot;help&quot;.)

&gt;&gt;<i> Many applications provide inline help which is not a label, and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same attributes would be appropriate here: &lt;div rel=&quot;help&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for=&quot;phone-number&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full number, including country code.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;samp&gt;+61 3 1234 5678&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would UAs use this?
</I>
UAs likely wouldn't, but scripts could. For example, a form might 
include sparing help by default, with a style sheet hiding more 
exhaustive help (as indicated by rel=&quot;help&quot;). Then a script could add a 
small help button after each control that has associated help (i.e. 
each control with name=&quot;x&quot; where there exists an element on the page 
with rel=&quot;help&quot; for=&quot;x&quot;). When a control's help button was clicked, the 
control's help would be shown.

Another possible presentation would be reserving whitespace to the 
right of the form, and making &lt;whatever rel=&quot;help&quot; for=&quot;x&quot;&gt; visible in 
that space whenever &lt;input name=&quot;x&quot;&gt; was focused.

&lt;<A HREF="http://uxmatters.com/MT/archives/000191.php">http://uxmatters.com/MT/archives/000191.php</A>&gt; shows these and other 
examples of dynamic help.

&gt;&gt;<i> The cite= attribute was also mentioned in this thread as one that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practically useless because there is no good way of presenting it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Sometimes authors use JavaScript to pull it out of a &lt;blockquote&gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> present it as a link underneath. But that still has accessibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems, because it doesn't work without JavaScript, and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resulting link text is either a raw URL or the same text for every 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quote. These problems make the technique even more unworkable for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;q&gt;.) As a result, authors usually use an &lt;a&gt; link to the resource 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're quoting (look at most self-hosted Weblogs for examples), and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there ends up being no machine-readable connection between the link 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the quote. This could similarly be achieved in the &lt;a&gt; element 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a for= attribute giving the ID of the &lt;blockquote&gt; or &lt;q&gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The majority of authors still wouldn't use these attributes, because 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would give them no presentational benefit. But at least authors 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be slightly more likely to use them than to use attributes that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have to re-present using extra elements or JavaScript.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should probably aim higher than that though...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
I'm suggesting either replacing &lt;foo cite=&quot;url&quot;&gt;&lt;/foo&gt; with &lt;bar 
rel=&quot;citation&quot; for=&quot;id-of-foo&quot;&gt;, or dropping cite= altogether.

Cheers
