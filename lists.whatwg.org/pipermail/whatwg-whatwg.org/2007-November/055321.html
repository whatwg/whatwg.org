</I>
Yes, indeed. The primary difference is that type=&quot;&quot; is specific to 
individual MIME types, whereas rel=&quot;&quot; is a generic way of saying what the 
remote document is and how to process it (at least, that's what 
&quot;relationship&quot; in this context has come to mean).


&gt;<i> I think it's much more likely in the above scenario that those links in 
</I>&gt;<i> Alexey's example would be links to HTML documents containing the items 
</I>&gt;<i> from the feed, and *on there* would be the feed auto-discovery stuff. 
</I>&gt;<i> That's how I'd author it, anyway. (and also, by extension, how I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> expect other sites to author it.)
</I>
That's an option, yes; but I don't think we should restrict authors to 
those techniques.

Hm, good point. Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; Then the browser wouldn't take these links and make them available in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a &quot;list of feeds&quot; interface, which is the problem we are trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Current browsers easily make lists of all links found on the page by

</I>&gt;<i> a subset of that. The type attribute gives enough information for this, 
</I>&gt;<i> especially if combined with the proposed &quot;;type=feed&quot;.
</I>
But we don't want to restrict the types of feeds to just the currently 
supported MIME types. Whether something is a feed or not is independent of 
it's type.

</I>&gt;<i> This is no more tight a relation than &quot;a page that the author thinks the

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link&gt;.
</I>
Indeed. But I don't see that as a problem.


&gt;<i> &gt; This is something that happens already in the real world -- I'm just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to make the spec distinguish &quot;alternate&quot; from &quot;feed&quot; when it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comes to such feeds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whoever is doing it abuses &lt;link&gt;.
</I>
Only if we say it is abuse, which I don't think we should. What do we gain 
by classifying this as abuse?


&gt;<i> rel=&quot;feed&quot; means &quot;the feed for the current document&quot;, rel=&quot;alternate&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> means &quot;an alternate representation of the current document&quot;. Therefore, 
</I>&gt;<i> rel=&quot;alternate feed&quot; means &quot;alternate representation of the current 
</I>&gt;<i> document by a feed&quot;.
</I>
Actually the spec defines this in detail, and it doesn't quite match your 
definition.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Currently the orange RSS icon means &quot;Subscribe to this page&quot;. This 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is a lot more useful (in my opinion) than it meaning &quot;subscribe to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; some random thing&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it doesn't. It means &quot;subscribe to something the author made 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available&quot;. Currently you have no way to know if it is the current 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page's feed or just a list of random related feeds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Surely the author could have referenced any irrelevant feed but that's 
</I>&gt;<i> not a good thing to do. Conscious authors should only use rel=&quot;feed&quot; as 
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the spec.
</I>
I agree, but the spec doesn't say what you want it to, and I'm not 
convinced that it should or that authors want it to.
