</I>
No, it's because transactions don't necessarily block the whole database. 
It's possible for database engines to implement row-level locking, for 
instance.

</I>
The exact behaviour of BEGIN IMMEDIATE is very SQLite-specific. While I do 
believe we will eventually have to lock down the SQL dialect, I don't 
think we should do this yet, since no content relies on SQL yet, and 
implementations might still find better SQL engines than SQLite.

Eventually, it will. I just don't want to constrain implementors too 
early. For the SQL dialect to be locked down, we need more experience, 
IMHO. Implementors are likely to ignore whatever the spec says if they're 
the first to market anyway, and I don't want to spend two months 
describing SQLite's semantics only to find that the market has decided 
that Microsoft SQL Server's SQL semantics are what the Web will be using.

</I>
This was discussed in an earlier thread. The conclusion was that it was 
better to have a thin API and leave the table construction up to the SQL 
dialect, than to move more and more into the API. (Also, it's a slippery 
slope -- why not move SELECT into the API too? And so on.)
