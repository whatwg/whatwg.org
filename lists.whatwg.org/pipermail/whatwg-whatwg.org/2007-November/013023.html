</I>&gt;<i> Hi, all. I hope this hasn't been proposed before, but if it is my 
</I>&gt;<i> googlage is failing me. My proposal is for the addition of a &quot;validate&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to the the &lt;a&gt; element that would let the client verify the 
</I>&gt;<i> content of a link as it comes in, and either put up a warning, a choice 
</I>&gt;<i> or just silently drop the incoming data, depending on a user preference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The validate attribute would describe an algorithm to employ and a 
</I>&gt;<i> result to compare it to; for example, somebody downloading the en-US 
</I>&gt;<i> version of FF 1.5 from the Mozilla.com homepage could click on a link 
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://foo.com/mozilla-i686.tgz&quot;">http://foo.com/mozilla-i686.tgz&quot;</A>
</I>&gt;<i>    validate=&quot;{md5}b63fcdf4863e59c93d2a29df853b6046&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and the client could verify as it comes in that it does at least have 
</I>&gt;<i> the md5sum that's advertised.  User notifications could include &quot;no 
</I>&gt;<i> validation&quot;, &quot;successfully validated&quot; and &quot;failed validation&quot;, and act 
</I>&gt;<i> according to the user's wishes in each case.
</I>
It's not entirely clear to me what problem this is solving; but wouldn't 
content-MD5 (RFC 1864) be a better solution?

</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't leave the attribute totally useless as it would catch the

</I>&gt;<i> I think that another one, probably more useful, attribute for &lt;a&gt; should

</I>&gt;<i> validation (for example, there's no need to even start the download 
</I>&gt;<i> after seeing a mismatching Content-Length header) and provide indication 
</I>&gt;<i> about the file size for the user (the UA could even calculate the 
</I>&gt;<i> estimate download time).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fact, now that I look at it, FF 1.5 doesn't even tell you where that

</I>
I think James, Alexey, and Mike make good points here.

I'm not convinced there's a pressing need for such a feature, partially 
because it's not entirely clear to me what problem it is solving. For 
downloads, code signing seems like a better solution all-round.
