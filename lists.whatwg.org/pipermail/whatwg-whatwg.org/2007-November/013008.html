No, not really, IMHO. Sites already have a big area where they can see 
their site, yet they make sites that are ugly and slow and unusable. Why 
would a tree (or other navigation representation) be any different?


&gt;<i> They might well think &quot;Ah, I can do like that other site: make a contact 
</I>&gt;<i> and a help page and tag 'm with display:meta to put them in that 
</I>&gt;<i> navigation thingy. I can even make &quot;sections&quot; that way to different 
</I>&gt;<i> parts of my site. k3wl.&quot;
</I>
Why would they care? We haven't seen any evidence to suggest they would. 


&gt;<i> That's how it works with most things: some technique becomes available 
</I>&gt;<i> in a nice and obvious form and suddenly people start using it.
</I>
Usually, there's at least a rumbling of desire before it's made available. 
For navigation toolbars, there's been basically nothing. Browsers have 
implemented them, shipped them, then removed them because nobody cared.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; [display:meta] could be interesting if (and it's a big if!) you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; could convince browsers to implement it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I imagine it would be a logical step for Opera and Safari to take, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; given their activity in the hand-held/small screen market where 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; something like this would probably be very useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well go and convince them and when you have some implementations we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can add it to the spec. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My impression was that representatives of most browsers subscribe to 
</I>&gt;<i> this list. So I'm assuming they've already heard me. Maybe they're 
</I>&gt;<i> silently laughing at the nonsense I'm talking. Maybe they're already 
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiastically implementing it. I've no idea.
</I>
I'm guessing not the latter, since it's been more than 18 months and we 
haven't seen anything new in this space.


&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't think we want to go back to the days where a browser 
</I>&gt;<i> defines its own new standards which other browsers are then forced to 
</I>&gt;<i> copy, faults included because by then too many authors/users are relying 
</I>&gt;<i> on that specific implementation. Makes more sense to me to all of us try 
</I>&gt;<i> to agree on something we think could work, and only then start work on 
</I>&gt;<i> (experimental) implementations and a spec.
</I>
Experimental implementations and spec work should happen in parallel, 
otherwise we end up with standards that are theoretically perfect and 
practically useless.
