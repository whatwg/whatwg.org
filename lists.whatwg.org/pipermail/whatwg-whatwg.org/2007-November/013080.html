<PRE>
In conclusion, &lt;ol type=...&gt; hasn't been added to HTML. The suggestion for 
addressing the main use case (reference) is to use a hyperlink and CSS to 
do the cross-references; CSS is working on this kind of thing.

In coming to this conclusion, the big concern from my point of view was 
that there was not a huge demand for this feature, and that had the 
feature never existed in earlier versions of HTML, it is likely that in 
fact there would be basically no demand for it at all. I think we should 
keep the bar high for features we add to HTML5.

Here are (slightly) more detailed replies:

Indeed.


&gt;<i> This problem has been discussed many times before and there're cases

</I>
We could do that. I'm not sure it's really worth it though.

I agree there are cases where it is important. I'm not sure they're 
important enough to add type=&quot;&quot;, though.

The solution would have to also involve CSS cross-references, I agree.

You could argue that. I suppose it is an unordered list. I'm not sure it's 
really a good idea though.

For legal text I could imagine using &lt;section&gt; and &lt;p&gt; instead of &lt;ol&gt;, 
though.

   &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; 1. ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
     &lt;p&gt; 1.1. ...&lt;/p&gt;

...etc.

Right. I think the HTML element is simply &lt;a href&gt;, but the CSS needs 
work.

Well, Past Ian, I think that's an interesting idea, but I would be tempted

</I>
This argues for us not bothering to worry about any of this at all, 
frankly. Just use whatever numbering style you want, and people will work 
it out if the numbering style used doesn't match expectations.

True.

These are (or would be) both CSS problems.

Also a very good point.
