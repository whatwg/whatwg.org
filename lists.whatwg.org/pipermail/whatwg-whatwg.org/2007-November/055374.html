Actually, having the media transcript separate from the media itself is far
superior than &quot;embedded&quot; captioning from the perspective of indexing and
SEO.  Full text transcripts external to their media extends the shelf life
of videos beyond what simple meta-data alone can provide.  A number of
proof-of-concept examples have emerged that even go so far as to use the
caption/transcription file's time-stamping to 'surgically' arrive at a
specific point in a video (in the example I saw, a lecture), allowing for
precise search and retrieve capacity.  While support for both external and
embedded captioning might be of value, encouragement of the external method
should be encouraged.
