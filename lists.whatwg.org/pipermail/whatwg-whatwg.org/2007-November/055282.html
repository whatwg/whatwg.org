</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; merely about what authors want, but at least as much, and probably 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; more, about what users want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a user on a dual monitor 1600x1200 system, I certainly don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any issues with space for navigation...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> {shrug} You still have the same problem: namely that the author of the 
</I>&gt;<i> site cannot know that you have those 2 large screens.
</I>
Actually media queries make this information quite accessible.


&gt;<i> &gt; At the moment, sites can (and do!) provide a view of their site, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; customised to their site, on pages as appropriate for that page and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that site. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    <A HREF="http://www.google.com/support">http://www.google.com/support</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...has links to other major Google pages in a sidebar at the top left, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; links to related pages in the mid-left sidebar area, links to related 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features at the bottom of the left sidebar, links to major subsections 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the middle of the page, a search form at the top right, links to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; popular subpages in the sidebar to the right, alternative suggestions 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; below that, links to other related pages below _that_, and at the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bottom has links to links only loosely related to the main topic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How would that page look if authored with your proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The page wouldn't exist ;) It *is* entirely a navigation menu. There is 
</I>&gt;<i> no other content there. In 'my proposal', Google wouldn't have to do 
</I>&gt;<i> that anymore. It could offer all that navigational information on pages 
</I>&gt;<i> that do have 'actual' content and leave it up to the user-agent to 
</I>&gt;<i> present it in a useful manner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That aside, I imagine your point is that there are so many links on that 
</I>&gt;<i> page, and that they are grouped in sections. But I see no problem with 
</I>&gt;<i> that. All those links together (assuming they all have a rel attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> and are set to display meta) would in a simplest form be displayed 
</I>&gt;<i> through some meta presentational mechanism as a long 'flat' list of 
</I>&gt;<i> links to other sections. That list might be presented as a shorter list, 
</I>&gt;<i> each with sublists - thus keeping the sections, provided sections are 
</I>&gt;<i> marked up that way. But instead of a list it could be presented as 
</I>&gt;<i> objects (iconized and/or text perhaps) for the 'root' items, each 
</I>&gt;<i> offering their sub items through a contextual menu. Display the current 
</I>&gt;<i> page in the center of the screen, with everything else around it. Arrows 
</I>&gt;<i> pointing from the &quot;current page&quot; in the center could make the &quot;rel&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> concept quite visual. Whatever. All up to the browser vendor's 
</I>&gt;<i> imagination. (I imagine objects with contextual menus pointing to sub 
</I>&gt;<i> items could work well on a small screen, like with a hand-held device. 
</I>&gt;<i> But it might work well with large-screen desktops too.) For extra 
</I>&gt;<i> coolness it could be implemented like Mac OS X's Expose feature: hit 
</I>&gt;<i> some F key and have the entire screen filled with floating objects 
</I>&gt;<i> representing the pages the site's menu points to ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could even turn it around. Imagine a Web page that offers both 
</I>&gt;<i> actual content and such a complex navigation menu as your Google example 
</I>&gt;<i> contains. A user-agent could present those navigational links as a Web 
</I>&gt;<i> page in a separate browser window, maybe looking exactly like this 
</I>&gt;<i> Google page. After all, display:meta would not require a Toolbar. It 
</I>&gt;<i> would merely require *some* 'meta-mechanism' for presentating content. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Consider lynx' LINK implementation for example - no toolbar, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> works fine. Or consider iCab's &quot;Link Manager&quot;, which brings up a browser 
</I>&gt;<i> window with a list of all links found in the currrent page.)
</I>
It would help to see an actual implementation of all this, to show that it 
would in fact be better than Web pages having their own stuff.


&gt;<i> &gt; Or take this page:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzz_log/entry/2006/01/07/2100/?fr=fp-buzz-img">http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzz_log/entry/2006/01/07/2100/?fr=fp-buzz-img</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...] How would that page look if authored with your proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Same as that Google page. (Except of course the links within the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> text would remain there.)
</I>
These pages are very different from each other. Saying they should be 
authored &quot;the same&quot; (especially when you've said one shouldn't exist) 
seems very vague, and not at all concrete enough for me to spec something.
