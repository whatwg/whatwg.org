Good idea, but I don't think it solves the same problem.  The &quot;Display  
Name&quot; user readable description is per database.  Specific web page/ 
apps can have an arbitrary number of databases, in addition to the  
possible collisions introduced by databases being per origin.

&gt;<i> I also think the estimated bytes thing is not that useful. It's going

I agree for many apps it will be hard to estimate this, but not all.
Whereas some apps will store arbitrary amounts of user data, others  
will just want a small amount of persistent storage client side for  
prefs/settings. and others still will know they are going to store  
50mb of app data client side.

&gt;<i> I think it should be up to the UA to make sure that the database does
</I>&gt;<i> not grow &quot;too large&quot; and to prompt the user for access to more storage
</I>&gt;<i> when necessary on behalf of the application.
</I>
Obviously all UA's should do this.  The expected size is more of a UI  
hint than a contract.  UA's should still do what they need to do.

The value of these arguments might end up being somewhat dubious, but  
I requested they be added based on implementation experience -  
noticing some holes left but the info available in the previous  
iterations of the spec.

I would not be against making the &quot;expected size&quot; optional, but I am a  
firm believer in the display name.
