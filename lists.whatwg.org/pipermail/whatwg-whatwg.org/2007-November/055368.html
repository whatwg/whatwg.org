<PRE>Sorry to be getting back to this thread this late, but I am trying to
catch up on email.

I'd like to contribute some thoughts on Ogg, CMML and Captions and
will cite selectively from emails in this thread.

</I>
Ogg indeed currently has no preferred means of specifying captions.
Usually it happens through a separate srt or ssa or similar file and
the player makes sure to display the captions correctly.

I just had a look at the W3C DFXP format
(<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/</A>). It looks rather
similar to CMML, lacks the hyperlinking functionality, but has
stylesheet and formatting support in it and more
subtitle/karaoke-specific functionality. I believe it would be
straightforward to define a media mapping for DFXP into Ogg should we
decide that DFXP is the way forward. Similarly, it would be rather
simple to define a media mapping for any of the anime subtitle formats
mentioned above.

Somewhat orthogonal to the discussion about subtitles is the use of
CMML. Yes, it is possible to use CMML in its current specification as
a superset of a srt-type sutitle format. However, the &quot;description&quot;
element would then need be interpreted as the caption, which is
somewhat of a misuse. I actually see captions and CMML as orthogonal
concepts - CMML provides hyperlinks and machine-readable textual
annotations in a timed manner, while captions provide formatted text
for users to read.

In the above described cases of DFXP, srt, ssa or CMML, each one of
these are text documents that can potentially live independent of the
video file n a server (&quot;externally stored&quot;). In fact, apart from CMML,
there is no defined mapping for Ogg of the others as yet.

&gt;<i> As a side note I like the idea of captions which are more than just the
</I>&gt;<i> usual stream text. Imagine a newsreel with timed &quot;Would you like to know
</I>&gt;<i> more?&quot; links. Given that HTML5 is usually viewed in browsers that

</I>&gt;<i> media elements supporting captioning and pipe the HTML captions into it
</I>&gt;<i> (with caution, imagine a caption itself recursively embedding a video).
</I>
That is exactly what CMML provides to Ogg: timed textual annotations,
hyperlinks out of a video, and hyperlink into a video (URI addressable
offsets and sections in the file).

I am wondering whether it might be a good idea to include some of the
DFXP specifications into CMML to enable it better for captiosn and
thus not have to deal with multiple timed text formats. I haven't
thought this through yet.

</I>&gt;<i> as a separate resource.
</I>
Think it through: when you currently download a video from bittorrent,
you download the subtitle file with it - mostly inside a zip file for
simplicity even. Downloading a separate caption file  is similar to
how you currently have to download the images separately for a Web
page. It's no big deal really as long as there is a connection that
can be automatically identified (e.g. through a link to the other
inside the one, or through a zip-file, or through a description file).

Actually for the authoring, I completely disagree. Authoring a
captioning file inside a text editor is much simpler than needing a
special application to author the captions directly inside a video
file.

In any case: I don't think it's a matter of one or the other. I
believe firmly that it should be both, no matter what caption format
and video format is being used.

</I>
Yes and no. Even if WHATWG decides that you should use Ogg with DFXP
inside it for captioning - as long as the Ogg community does not
provide a media mapping (i.e. a prescrption on how to do the embedding
into the Ogg container), there is no standard means for doing so.
Thus, if there is a need for such a mapping, the Ogg community would
indeed need to create such a specification, unless there is no need
for encapsulating the caption files directly inside the Ogg container.
I believe howere, that such a specification is necessary to enable
ubiquitous usabilty and uptake.

Silvia.
