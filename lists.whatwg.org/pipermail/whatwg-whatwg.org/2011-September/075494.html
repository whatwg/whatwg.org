Apparently I need a faster CPU:

By way of comparison, in Firefox 8.0a2:

Annoyingly, it looks like Opera is failing some tests solely due to
not following the HTML5 serialization algorithm.  I rely on innerHTML
heavily for the tests.  I could try to work around these failures, but
hopefully IE and Opera will migrate to HTML5 serialization soon enough
that it won't be worth the effort.

It's very likely that some of the tests are wrong, or that they match
the spec but the spec is wrong.  With that kept in mind, yes, it
should be suitable for integration into browser test suites.  It uses
James Graham's testharness.js, so I should think you'd want to make
some bridge that lets that integrate into your test suites, then plug
these in.  testharness.js is designed for this use-case, but as far as
I know, only Opera uses it that way at this point.  You might want to
speak to James about it if you want to work on integrating it.  There
are lots more tests that use testharness.js, such as these:

And more are being written regularly.  This is now the preferred test
format for the HTML and WebApps WGs, so it would be great if browsers
supported it.
