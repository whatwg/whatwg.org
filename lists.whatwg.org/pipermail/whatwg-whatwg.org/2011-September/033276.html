I've clarified the spec so that hopefully it is now defined, if maybe 
still not really clear.

The spec now says that solid colours aren't affect by the transformation 
matrix, gradients are (this was already defined), and patterns are 
affected _after_ the repetition is applied.

Thus solid colours should fill fine, but canvases and patterns would do 
fill nothing (though while still applying globalCompositeOperator), 
because they are scaled to an image with one dimension having zero width.


&gt;<i> For CanvasPatterns, I can't see any reasonable way to define any 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering, so I suggest they should just paint nothing when the current 
</I>&gt;<i> transform is singular. This needs a spec update I think.
</I>
That's effectively what I specced (though by saying that the pattern is 
scaled after being repeated, so there's no question of how you repeat a 
zero-width image).


&gt;<i> For linear CanvasGradients, I think we can follow the spec and simply 
</I>&gt;<i> transform the gradient points. That would mean drawing the horizontal 
</I>&gt;<i> gradient normally and drawing nothing for the vertical gradient. This 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't need a spec change.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure what to do about radial CanvasGradients. We can transform 
</I>&gt;<i> the center points but the effect on the radii can't be described by 
</I>&gt;<i> simply transforming points. Perhaps the most logical approach would be 
</I>&gt;<i> to fill with the &quot;outside&quot; color (black in my testcase). This needs a 
</I>&gt;<i> spec update.
</I>
Would it make more sense to define that what is transformed is the 
resulting radial gradient, rather than the points while the gradient is 
drawn? (I'm not really sure what the latter really means.) I've changed 
the spec to do this.


&gt;<i> For solid colors I think it's logical to just fill with the color. This 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't need a spec change.
</I>
It needed a change to indicate that the transformation matrix doesn't 
apply.

I've also added some text to define that the color of a fill or stroke 
where the pattern or radial gradient has been collapsed to a point is 
transparent black.

That makes sense. It's not how the spec is written.


&gt;<i> It seems like a useful invariant if the different styles behave the same

</I>&gt;<i> learn about patterns first (which is very concrete -- &quot;give it an

</I>&gt;<i> behavior in this particular case, but it's a fairly pathological case 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, and it doesn't seem worthwhile to trade away consistency to get 
</I>&gt;<i> more intuitive behavior in this special case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess one big problem with this approach is you have a singularity at 
</I>&gt;<i> determinant zero, and that's really awkward because you can't rely on 
</I>&gt;<i> floating-point equality comparisons unless you allow some tolerance for

</I>&gt;<i> should result in the color being painted.  This is obviously bad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So this is probably my pure math background showing through rather than

</I>
I could see an argument either way.

That's an interesting point. Legacy reasons? I haven't changed this, but 
it is inconsistent.

I've gotten around this by defining that the scaling happens after the 
repeating.
