Yes, but it's important to know that the browser still percent-decodes  
everything after the &quot;,&quot;. It's just that in this case, there are no %HH to  
decode. You have to be careful here and know that the data/markup is still  
not literal. For example, if you want a literal &quot;%5E&quot;, you have to use  
%255E. If you include a URI with a bunch of %HH, you have to escape all  
those &quot;%&quot;. So, while typing, if you have no problem typing %25, you should  
have no problem typing %23.

Are you saying that data URI authors know that they have to escape &quot;%&quot;,  
but don't know that they have to escape &quot;#&quot;? Or, are you saying that the  
problem is more serious and data URI authors think the data is  
*completely* literal? If the latter, we definitely shouldn't be  
encouraging anything but properly-encoded data.

FWIW, I asked for advice on &quot;#&quot; in mailto URIs (since mailto URI handlers  
don't make use of frag ids for mailto and frag ids are not specified for  
mailto) at  
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-iri/2009Oct/0030.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-iri/2009Oct/0030.html</A>&gt; and  
wanted to propose that '#' be allowed as-is when authoring without having  
to percent-encode it. But, that didn't go over too well.

&gt;<i>    data:text/html,&lt;i&gt;here is some italic text&lt;i&gt;
</I>
I don't really like that though as it's not portable. If I wanted to copy  
that from the address field and paste it into a plain-text document, it'd  
look funny like this:

&lt;data:text/html,&lt;i&gt;here is some italic text&lt;i&gt;&gt;

And, for mail clients that linkify links in plain-text messages, I can see  
that going wrong with the link (the clickable, underlined part and href)  
ending up as only &quot;data:text/html,&lt;i&quot;.

&gt;<i> So we can proactively check for &gt;/&lt; characters anywhere after the &quot;#&quot;,  
</I>&gt;<i> and if we find them, then we can pretty safely assume that the author  
</I>&gt;<i> intended for the &quot;#&quot; to be part of the document, rather than a  
</I>&gt;<i> fragment-ID delimiter.
</I>
I still don't like it personally as it further encourages authors to not  
encode their data and is not portable. But, if this is to happen, it  
should definitely be limited to mime types that contain markup. It  
wouldn't be useful for data:text/plain (how would you differentiate in  
that case?). And, for text/javascript and text/css etc., some other type  
of lookahead characters(s) would have to be used.
