<PRE>I have a fear for start throwing exceptions at places where we didn't used
to because that'll end up stopping the script.  I guess we can start logging
some console message first but given the market share of IE and WebKit and
how they're both used in native frameworks (.net / WebKit), I'm not
convinced this is the best option from compatibility perspective.

Regardless, it appears to me that we need more usage data we before we make
a call.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking pragmatically, I've never seen a bug report in Mozilla where
