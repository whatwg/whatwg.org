I was surprised at first by the fact that # was always treated as a
fragment delimiter in data: URLs by some browsers, but after reading
this thread, I agree it's the only sane choice.  It's not what I'd
initially expected, but if that's how all browsers behaved, I'd have
figured it out pretty quickly.

I find Michael's point about % particularly convincing.  Authors have
to encode % anyway for their data URL handling to be robust, and once
they're doing that, encoding # is not much extra effort.  Making #
work without encoding encourages authors to forget about %.  Trying to
key off &lt;/&gt; for text/html only is just a really scary and evil hack.
If browsers agreed on treating # in data URLs like in any other URL,
authors would quickly figure it out and remember to encode.  I think
this is the best solution by far.

This is assuming that the compat issues aren't bad enough to rule it
out, of course . . .
