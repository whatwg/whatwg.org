Yep.

He explicitly mentioned that we're getting bug reports of &quot;this works in 
Chrome but not in Firefox&quot; variety, no?  Possibly further down the 
thread, not in the initial post.

</I>
That's possible.  If we had UA compat on the correct behavior now, I 
would be rather opposed to changing anything.

&gt;<i> If the argument is &quot;but this breaks too many sites&quot; or &quot;we think
</I>&gt;<i> that some vendor or other will not implement the correct behavior due to
</I>&gt;<i> convenience issues&quot; or whatever other reason
</I>
The &quot;argument&quot; is that other vendors have not implemented correct 
behavior even though they've known for years that theirs is incorrect. 
Gecko was just as guilty as anyone else in this matter until recently, 
because getting to correct behavior involved breaking compatibility 
promises we'd made.

So I think the proposal is being offered as a possible middle ground 
that people who don't want to converge on the correct behavior might be 
willing to converge on.  If people are willing to converge on the 
correct behavior, I think that would be pretty good too.  Given Adam's 
response earlier in this thread, I'm not holding my hopes up.
