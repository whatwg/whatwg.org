Note that I recently checked in some changes to &lt;script&gt; to expose a 
readyState IDL attribute and to fire 'readystatechange' events, based on 
what IE has implemented here.

I'd say &quot;need not block&quot;, rather than &quot;should not block&quot;. The latter is 
more a judgement call.

Yup, that should work pretty well in the current model.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         -&gt; it could prevent the requirement of handling asynchronous 
</I>&gt;<i> code via callback lists, but I'm not sure how much it is acceptable
</I>
Yeah, I could see how that would be an intuitive way of thinking it would 
work. It doesn't (as you discovered). Since it would mean the browser just 
locking up while the download finished, or at least showing its own 
progress bar UI rather than something that feels like part of the app, I'm 
not sure how desireable it really would be anyway.

</I>&gt;<i> running animations very noticeably (a common complaint we had while 
</I>&gt;<i> testing some of the preload strategies).
</I>
Fixing this latency can be done entirely in the browsers today, by moving 
compilation off the main thread. We don't have to change the language to 
support this feature.


&gt;<i> Moving parsing and compilation to a background thread solves part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, the problem where doing so freezes the UI currently. It doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> solve what I consider to be the important part of the problem, and that 
</I>&gt;<i> is the inability to have a JavaScript resource downloaded but not 
</I>&gt;<i> applied to the page. The best next experience can only be achieved when 
</I>&gt;<i> the resources are ready and then applied at the right moment.
</I>
Since the download and compilation can all be done in the background, 
then, *once browsers do this*, scripts can be structured to do nothing but 
provide a single callback that &quot;applies&quot; the script, before which the 
script does nothing. That would do exactly what you describe, as far as I 
can tell.


&gt;<i> To be clear: this is not a problem that is unique to JavaScript. The 
</I>&gt;<i> same problem exists with all external resources, such as images and CSS. 
</I>&gt;<i> The difference is that both images and CSS allow you to download the 
</I>&gt;<i> resource and then apply to the page later when you want (images via new 
</I>&gt;<i> Image(), CSS via dynamic &lt;link&gt; element that is only applied when added 
</I>&gt;<i> to the page).
</I>
Script allows this too, just by having the script do nothing except define 
a callback. Defining a callback is trivially fast to do (the cost is in 
the download and compilation stages, which can be done in the background).


I recommend approaching the browser vendors directly to convince them that 
moving compilation to a secondary thread is a worthwhile optimisation.

If the script does nothing but define a callback, executing it will take 
roughly zero time. Certainly far less time than is perceivable or than 
could interfere with animations.

I think it's pretty clear that if browsers started moving as much JS 
processing as possible off the main thread, that libraries would start 
taking advantage of this, so I don't think we need to worry about this 
case. It's an issue only during transition.


&gt;<i> For this use case I think it would be handy to have a way to express

</I>&gt;<i> Browsers that ignored this behavior would evaluate the script sooner 
</I>&gt;<i> than the author might expect, but it's usually every easy to detect when 
</I>&gt;<i> this is happening and react appropriately.
</I>
If all you want to do is download it (not preprocess it) then you can just 
use XHR and then stick the script contents into an inline &lt;script&gt;.

zewt's test case is interesting:

<A HREF="https://zewt.org/~glenn/test-top-level-context-execution/">https://zewt.org/~glenn/test-top-level-context-execution/</A>

On my machine, Gecko takes about 150ms to compile the code (time from 
download finishing to script starting), about 0ms to run the top-level 
code, and about 10ms to run the initialisation function. Chrome, on the 
other hand, takes about 10ms to compile the code, about 0ms to run the 
top-level code, and about 150ms to run the initialisation function.

Gecko demonstrates that it is possible to move the vast bulk of the 
execution time here off the main thread (though it hasn't yet been done), 
indicating that we don't need a new feature to make preparing this kind of 
script fast. Chrome, similarly, shows that today for this kind of code 
there is no need for a feature to explicitly make the code prepare faster, 
though in Chrome's case actually applying the code would be slow.

If the problem is power consumption, then we really have to consider the 
problem at a higher level. Will delaying the user by 100ms where the user 
is just waiting looking at a &quot;please wait&quot; sign on the screen use more or 
less power than downloading and running the script in the background so 
that the user spends less total time with the screen on? Given the battery 
cost of a big LCD screen vs the battery cost of the radio and CPU, this 
might not be a clear-cut decision.

To consider the battery cost here I'd really need to look at a concrete 
example and do some measurements.

The majority of your comments are essentially disagreeing with the basic 
premise that if authors want to optimise their code, they need to be able 
to control that code.

Fundamentally, I disagree with the idea that the only code that a site can 
update is the script loading code. Sites need to be able to handle 
security problems in any of the code they rely on, and the same techniques 
that can be used to resolve security problems can be used to solve loading 
problem. Also, we need to design for the future, not the past. There will 
be more sites made in the future than have been made to date. While it's 
important that we not break past sites, it's more important to make future 
sites faster than it is to make today's sites faster, especially in the 
case of sites that simply can't (or won't) change their scripts.


&gt;<i> There's a whole bunch of comments in this thread which allude to the 
</I>&gt;<i> idea that the problems being expressed are simple to fix if authors just 
</I>&gt;<i> change how they write their code. While that may (or may not) be true, 
</I>&gt;<i> it's irrelevant to the real-world web we're trying to fix *right now*, 
</I>&gt;<i> because the vast majority of JavaScript is not written this way (such 
</I>&gt;<i> that it's entirely modular and causes no side-effects on &quot;execution&quot;).
</I>
Nothing discussed in this forum will help &quot;right now&quot;. Any changes to the 
spec will take months if not years to deploy to a majority of browsers.


&gt;<i> Continuing to suggest in this thread that the solution is to modify the 
</I>&gt;<i> script is both aggravating and unhelpful, as it completely misses the 
</I>&gt;<i> most important majority use-case: loading (almost) all the current 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript on the web.
</I>
Since pages using those scripts are going to need to be adapted to use any 
new feature we come up with, why would such adaptations be limited to the 
script loading library and not other libraries?

It's not like these adaptations are complicated. All we're talking about 
here is moving things into a function that can be run later, instead of 
running everything immediately. It's maybe a half-dozen lines of 
boilerplate code in the most complicated case, as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> &gt; But really, it seems better to structure your scripts so that they 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't do anything when they are run except expose a callback that you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can run when you want the code to run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, it's better. But it's also unrealistic to expect all the millions 
</I>&gt;<i> of scripts on the web to change simply because I want my pages to load 
</I>&gt;<i> faster.
</I>
Any changes to the spec are going to have to result in changes to pages 
for those pages to take advantage of the spec changes.

In practice, sites are improved individually, and it is not at all 
unrealistic to expect a site to improve its scripts.


&gt;<i> And as I said, it's untenable to suggest that my ONLY remedy is to 
</I>&gt;<i> self-host and modify such scripts.
</I>
No need to self-host them. Just like the scripts in question can be 
patched to fix security bugs, they can be patched to have different setup 
behaviour, and those patches can be hosted in the same place.


&gt;<i> &gt; What problems do these solutions solve?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, they solve this problem:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to load two or more scripts that I don't control, from locations 
</I>&gt;<i> that aren't my own, in parallel (for performance), and I want them to 
</I>&gt;<i> execute in order..... BUT I want to control when that execution starts.
</I>
I think the better solution to this problem is to get control over those 
scripts and locations. Without a concrete example of the problem (i.e. an 
actual site, an actual explanation of why you can't control scripts that 
you are trusting to run on your site!), it is hard to evaluate the 
situation.


&gt;<i> This thread seems to be so easily side-tracked into the minutia of 
</I>&gt;<i> conjecturing about background thread parsing and different 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation details. I wish we could just take as a given that 
</I>&gt;<i> parsing/execution of a script are not zero-cost (though they may be 
</I>&gt;<i> smaller cost, depending on various things), and that ANY control that a 
</I>&gt;<i> web performance optimization expert can get in terms of when non-zero 
</I>&gt;<i> cost items happen is, in general, a good thing.
</I>
I don't think that's a given at all. For example, it doesn't seem to be a 
given that giving authors control over whether GC happens before or after 
printing (say) is a good thing.

There is a huge risk in giving authors control: many authors are not 
experts, and will make poor choices.


&gt;<i> The thread also makes a lot of references to &lt;script async&gt; and how that 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be the silver-bullet solution. The problem is two-fold:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. &lt;script async&gt; only effectively tells a user-agent to make the 
</I>&gt;<i> loading of that script resource happen in parallel with other tasks, and 
</I>&gt;<i> that it can choose to execute that script at any point whenever it feels 
</I>&gt;<i> is good. This means that the script in fact can be executed still before 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM-ready, or between DOM-ready and window.onload, or after 
</I>&gt;<i> window.onload. Thus, the script's execution effects the page's rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> in an intermittent way, depending on network speeds, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script defer&gt; on the other hand specifically tells the script to wait 
</I>&gt;<i> on its execution until after onload.
</I>
Actually both async and defer scripts in a page will run before the 
'onload' handler for the page.
