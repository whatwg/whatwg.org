<PRE>Hi Mike, I've got some concerns with that:

&gt;<i> HTML5 does not provide a means of submitting form content that is
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise rendered as normal text
</I>&#160;
I believe this is the job of CSS rather than HTML - I would say that anything
due to be submitted to the server is semantically an &lt;input&gt; even if it's styled
as plain text. &#160;

&gt;<i> Currently, the only way to implement this is to maintain two copies
</I>&gt;<i> of the value
</I>
I disagree that it's the only way - you could easily use a javascript event
handler on the submit of the form which would go through all &lt;output&gt; elements
and create &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;&#160; elements within the form - this way you're
capturing the 'real output value' at the point of submitting which seems like
it's exactly what you're after.&#160; It's worth noting that I'm not much of a fan of
JS workarounds, but I don't see this as a concern because the &lt;output&gt; value
sounds like it would be created by JS, so a non-JS user would (presumably) not
have any &lt;output&gt; elems which need converting (in your specific use-case) so
they'd hit your normal server-side fallback for non-JS users.

&gt;<i> This can be remedied by allowing the value of &lt;output&gt; elements to be
</I>&gt;<i> submitted.
</I>&#160;
I would say that this is not helpful - the spec at
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-button-element.html#the-output-element">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-button-element.html#the-output-element</A>
states &quot;The output element represents the result of a calculation&quot; and the
example provided is a calculation between two text fields.&#160; The use-case in the
documentation would work fine without JS because the two numbers which are added
together are &lt;inputs&gt; and would be submitted even though the answer wouldn't be
- this way you can calculate on the server-side directly based on the user's
input (proper semantic usage of &lt;input&gt;) and the output (semantically &lt;output&gt;)
is not important to the server.
&#160;
I would also say that it's specifically unhelpful to send back additional fields
as this will cause cross-browser inconsistencies while it's rolled out (and in
legacy browsers) and cause extra data bloating POST bodies or Query Strings for
what seems to me to be a feature which is not required in what I would see as
the majority of uses of the &lt;output&gt; element.
&#160;
To meet your use-case I would recommend one of the following:
&#160;
a) Using CSS to style the &lt;input&gt; in an environment where it's semantically
correct to use &lt;input&gt; (if this plain text rendering is truly an input to be
changed by the user) e.g.
&#160;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
&#160;&#160;&#160; input, p{
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; background: transparent;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; border: 0 none;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; font-family: sans-serif;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; color: #333;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; font-size: 14px;
&#160;&#160;&#160; }
&#160;&#160;&#160; input.smallNumber{
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; width: 1.5em;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; display: inline-block;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; text-align: center;
&#160;&#160;&#160; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;form action=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
&#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;input name=&quot;textInput&quot; class=&quot;smallNumber&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;
value=&quot;5&quot;/&gt; people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&#160;
(note: @class smallNumber is a 'small number' (not too large) rather than a
'small field containing a number')&#160;

b) Using JS to replace/replicate specific &lt;output&gt; elems with &lt;input
type=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; on the form submit.
c) Assuming you're accepting user input, then displaying the calculated summary
in an &lt;ouptut&gt; tag, then you can re-calculate the summary on the server-side
based on the user's &lt;input&gt; - NOTE: this would be dangerous if the example is
much more complicated than the documented example.

</I>&gt;<i> This can be remedied by allowing the value of &lt;output&gt; elements to be

</I>&gt;<i> I initially thought that this was precisely what the &lt;output&gt; element
