&gt;<i> One reasonable alternative is *&lt;cmnt&gt;*

This certainly has a better legacy compatibility story than &lt;comment&gt;. :)

&gt;<i> Back to the main point of marking up comments, I offer youtube as an
</I>&gt;<i> example.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRG5VNNUq_E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRG5VNNUq_E</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here we have the item being commented on (the video) in a full-width block,
</I>&gt;<i> with the lower half of the page divided into two sections, comments on the
</I>&gt;<i> left. If user-submitted comments must be &lt;article&gt; tags inside &lt;article&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tags, then virtually the whole page would have to be inside an &lt;article&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tag, or, of course, the user-submitted comments are marked up as now, using
</I>&gt;<i> class=&quot;comment&quot;.
</I>
Can you express this in terms of the problems it causes to end-users?
As far as I can tell, it's not a problem.

&gt;<i> The problem I am trying to solve is a perceived error in the HTML5 spec,
</I>&gt;<i> which specifies that comments should be marked up as articles inside
</I>&gt;<i> articles. I believe this to be an error for several reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Articles and comments are different, and should therefore use different
</I>&gt;<i> elements (otherwise the reference to marking up user-submitted comments as
</I>&gt;<i> articles within articles should be removed).
</I>
&quot;[S]elf-contained composition in a document, page, application, or
site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or
reusable, e.g. in syndication&quot; is a concept that includes comments,
blog posts, and news stories. So there's no contradiction in the spec
here.

I grant &quot;article&quot; is a potentially confusing name for this concept.
One could bikeshed about the name; I suspect if you consult the
archives such bikeshedding has already happened.

&gt;<i> 2. Comments are a unique type of content, since they are submitted by users,
</I>&gt;<i> not site developers or content managers.
</I>
This is not unique to comments. For example, some sites feature
user-submitted stories, blog posts, etc. Even if it were unique to
comments, I don't see how it creates a user problem we'd need markup
to solve.

&gt;<i> 3. Robots and plugins can extract comments from web pages more easily if
</I>&gt;<i> they have their own element. Comments can then be more easily syndicated,
</I>&gt;<i> displayed, hidden, styled, etc.
</I>
What user problems do the existing solutions to these tasks cause?

e.g. RSS/Atom feeds, hAtom, old-fashioned scraping for extraction,
syndication of comments.

e.g. class for styling.

Why do you think we could get enough systems to use the &lt;comment&gt;
element correctly enough to support the creation of new solutions
using the &lt;comment&gt; tag instead?

&gt;<i> 4. Comments often apply to things other than articles, such as blog posts,
</I>&gt;<i> forum topics, social network status updates, images, videos, links, and
</I>&gt;<i> other comments, which should not have to be marked up as articles just so
</I>&gt;<i> the comments can be marked up as articles within articles.
</I>
a) A lot of those things are appropriately marked up with &lt;article&gt; as
&quot;self-contained composition[s]&quot;. In particular, blog posts, forum
topics, social network updates, and comments should all be marked up
with &lt;article&gt; per HTML5. In some contexts, that would also be
appropriate for images and videos. Nothing in the definition of the
element implies it's restricted to text content.

b) Since a comment is just a &quot;self-contained composition&quot;, it can be
marked up with &lt;article&gt; whether nested inside another &lt;article&gt; or
not.

So there isn't a problem here.

&gt;<i> 5. Comments sometimes appear in a different region of the page than the item
</I>&gt;<i> that they are referencing, hence the markup for comments should not have to
</I>&gt;<i> be contained within the markup of the item.
</I>
a) No user problems have been identified that would be created by not
having the comment &lt;article&gt;'s nested. That would just be the most
common pattern.

b) Do you have an example of what you're talking about? It sounds like
the comments could still be nested under the &lt;article&gt;, with
intervening matter placed there by CSS - including future features
that allow rearrangement of the order of block content, for example:

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/</A>

We generally don't want to introduce markup features for problems that
can be solved through better styling features.
