</I>
Implementing it in JavaScript will be somewhat challenging because
managed/automatic transactions need to keep track of all changes made by a
function it's calling.  It'll require a heavy use of mutation events (and
they're going away!)

     myEditor.undoManager.transact({apply: function () {
&gt;<i> insert(document.createTextNode('o')) }, label: 'First transaction'});
</I>&gt;<i>      myEditor.undoManager.transact({apply: function () {
</I>&gt;<i> insert(document.createTextNode('k')) }, label: 'Merging transaction'},
</I>&gt;<i> true);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      - User calls myEditor.undoManager.item(0).label.  Which label does he
</I>&gt;<i>      get back?  For that matter, which transaction does he get back, and
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i>      transaction is forever hidden from him?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You get an array (should make it immutable) that contains both transactions.
So you get undefined.  But this behavior is stated in my working draft:
<A HREF="http://rniwa.com/editing/undomanager.html#transaction-group">http://rniwa.com/editing/undomanager.html#transaction-group</A>

I agree I need to refine the definition of item.

     4. Did we talk about a maxlength for the UndoManager?  If we allow an
&gt;<i>   infinite number of transactions in an UndoManager, a lot of memory could
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i>   eaten up.  I'd say the page author should be able to limit the number of
</I>&gt;<i>   transactions kept in memory at his or her discretion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was thinking that we should just put a fixed limit on how many
transactions can be stored, and give no guarantee beyond that point.  I
don't think authors should be able to control that limit because that'll
hinder user agent's ability to do so.

  5. Section 2.1 is Definitions, but several of the definitions are
&gt;<i>   scattered around the specification (Transaction, for example), and do not
</I>&gt;<i>   start with basic definitions.  I think this section needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten,
</I>&gt;<i>   starting with the most basic definitions.  (Define a transaction. Define
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i>   transaction group based on the definition of a transaction.  Define an
</I>&gt;<i> undo
</I>&gt;<i>   stack based on the definitions of a transaction group and a transaction,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>   so on.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That might be a good idea.  Will try.

  6. I'm wondering a bit about localization of the Transaction object's
&gt;<i>   label.  It's probably an unnecessary concern (this specification
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i>   go too deep), but I'm just wondering how both scripted and native
</I>&gt;<i>   transactions will detect the language of the webpage and generate
</I>&gt;<i>   locale-specific labels.
</I>

I think that's fine.  As far as I know, there are no major user agents that
let can change the current locate in the middle of a session.  And labels
should be localized to user agent's locate since it'll be shown as a part of
its native UI.
