 &gt;&gt; Browsers handle the &quot;#&quot; character in data URIs very differently, and
 &gt;&gt; the arguably &quot;correct&quot; behavior is probably not what authors actually
 &gt;&gt; want in many cases.
 &gt; Do you have any evidence for that assertion, e.g. author surveys,
 &gt; occurance in sites, number of duplicates in mozilla bugzilla (relative
 &gt; to other common bugs)?

No large-scale data like that, just a few anecdotal reports in IRC of 
Firefox purportedly being &quot;broken&quot; on particular content (that contained 
a &quot;#&quot;), whereas Chromium was &quot;working&quot;.  (one instance about a week ago, 
which prompted this proposal)

Plus, a concern that people can *almost* just stick pure HTML/SVG into a 
data URI (see examples below) except for &quot;#&quot; characters which break things.

 &gt; This change would probably have to be communicated to other software
 &gt; working with data URIs (Python's urlparse module comes to mind).

Sure, ultimately. One step at a time.

 &gt; Do you
 &gt; intend to update the RFC on the point or leave that usage
 &gt; non-conforming?

I'm not sure. Right now this is just a proposal for better 
interoperability, but ultimately, yeah, it'd be great to have this 
specified.

 &gt;&gt; Note that in cases where an author *accidentally* includes &quot;#&quot; inside
 &gt;&gt; their data URI (e.g.&lt;body background=&quot;#f00&quot;&gt;),
 &gt;
 &gt; What's with the unencoded bracket (should be %3C) and space (should be
 &gt; %20) beforehand? Why wouldn't parsing stop at those points?

Those are fine, actually -- but I should have included an actual URI 
that loads in browsers, like the following (this is what I meant):
   data:text/html,&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background: #f00'&gt;

So to answer your question -- that does render just fine (giant red 
page) in Chromium, without any need to encode the space or the brackets. 
  It also renders fine in Opera if you point an &lt;iframe&gt; at it.  (but 
not if you type it directly into the URLbar -- that's the inconsistency 
on their part that I mentioned in my post)

And in Firefox, it renders fine if you just encode the # character:
   data:text/html,&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style=&quot;background:%23f00&quot;&gt;
(that makes it load fine from Opera's URLbar, too.)

So no -- practically at least, there's no need to encode the &gt;/&lt; or the 
space character.
