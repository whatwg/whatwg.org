</I>&gt;<i> I concur with your points:

</I>&gt;<i> - somehow backgrounding a process while keeping processing on the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both points seem to indicate that the API should not be of the
</I>&gt;<i> fire-and-forget style but would rather require fine control by the
</I>&gt;<i> developer, to ensure that it does not eat on performances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hypothetically, this could be solved by an API with primitives to:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. enqueue data to be sent;
</I>&gt;<i> 2. allocate x milliseconds to processing/sending the data;
</I>&gt;<i> 3. cancel sending some of the data;
</I>&gt;<i> 4. cancel complete communication.
</I>Could you expand on how you came to these 4 primitives, please?
It feels like a lot of reflection came from the current discussion to 
this conclusion, but I fail to understand it. Maybe one way to explain 
these 4 primitives would be to show how you want to solve the &quot;save 
browser state&quot; problem using them without freezing the browser.

In any case, ECMAScript 7 will very likely &quot;steal&quot; the event loop [1] 
from HTML5 and it seems that the primitive you're describing and the 
reflection that came to them would be worthwhile in the event loop 
reflection.
Maybe some part of this discussion should be moved to es-discuss or 
public-script-coord at some point.

&gt;<i> The idea being that all operations have (soft) time bound guarantees so
</I>&gt;<i> can be interleaved by the user as part of a |requestAnimationFrame|
</I>&gt;<i> loop. Also, data is never copied, so if this data changes before
</I>&gt;<i> communication is complete, API clients need to handle invalidation on
</I>&gt;<i> their own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this sounds very much like something that can be implemented as a
</I>&gt;<i> pure JS library.
</I>I'm particularly puzzled about that especially on the &quot;allocate x 
milliseconds to processing/sending the data&quot;, but I'm waiting for your 
explanations above to better understand what you mean.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      FirefoxOS [1, 2] is a mobile operating system in which all applications

</I>&gt;<i> If you do not mind, I will not continue on this part of the
