</I>
Is that implemented by some vendors?

&gt;<i> but it it is unfortunate that controlling IME from web apps is so

</I>&gt;<i> DOM lv3 compositionevent and IME API).
</I>
As I see it @inputmode isn't here to be a feature like this but maybe
Hixie had a different vision when he wrote the specs for it.

&gt;<i> That said, even though authors of web apps may want to force the IME
</I>mode or
&gt;<i> its script mode for user's sake, it may cause user's confusion as they are
</I>&gt;<i> so accustomed to change mode manually where such mode is required.
</I>&gt;<i> So if a web app sets some mode, the user may toggle it back to unintended
</I>&gt;<i> mode
</I>&gt;<i> and get frustrated.
</I>
I tend to agree. In one hand, I believe that users might get irritated
if they can't control the inputmode but in another hand, forcing it
might fulfil use cases where authors use Javascript to force a user to
type in uppercase for example (that happens in a few forms).

Maybe if it was named @inputhint and the user was allowed to change the
input mode, it would be clearer?

'auto' would be the default value.

There is a confusion here. Firefox OS v1 isn't going to implement the
list mentioned above. It is going to be some kind of subsets of what the
WHATWG specification has. But I do not think we should take into account
what Firefox OS implements in that discussion.

&gt;<i> Using semantic names might give us the warm fuzzies, but is there
</I>&gt;<i> really any semantic use we will get out of these that we wouldn't by
</I>&gt;<i> using &quot;lowercase&quot;, &quot;titlecase&quot; or &quot;autocapitalized&quot;?
</I>
I think 'titlecase' can be added later. It's not in opposition with
'name' because 'name' is not really title case (think of &quot;Anne van K.&quot;)
and it will do autocompletion from the contact book ideally.
'lowercase' could also be added later. I just don't see much use cases
for it.
Regarding 'autocapitalized', I do not think the name is great. Apple has
&quot;autocapitalized={on,off,word,sentence,character}&quot; if I recall
correctly. It's probably clearer but &quot;inputmode=autocapitalized&quot; is
probably not that much self explanatory.

&gt;<i> I take it verbatim and name would disable any spelling corrections,
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> and name would also titlecase?
</I>
'name' would try to get the casing correct and auto-complete from the
contact book.

&gt;<i> But the difference between text and
</I>&gt;<i> prose seems really hard to understand. I can't even understand the
</I>&gt;<i> actual behavioral difference (which is what authors actually care
</I>&gt;<i> about) reading the spec, much less guessing by the name.
</I>
I think the difference between 'verbatim' and 'text' is good to have.
Should we fix the spec and the naming?

I tend to prefer &lt;input type='text' inputmode='name'&gt; over &lt;input
type='name'&gt; because &lt;input type='name'&gt;, for the moment would be
nothing else but a text field with an address book autocompletion. I
would prefer to have 'tel' that way instead of having it a type FWIW.
