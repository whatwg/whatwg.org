Anne,

I feel like you've misunderstood my comments/observations.  Let me clarify
and see:

1) I think this API is more sensible - I had the same problem with mutation
observers api.

2) we should not be forever stuck with an unintuitive API

3) we have interop now and a mature spec, that sucks in retrospect that we
didn't see this earlier, but it is what it is.

4) this adds nothing in the way of features, it is merely sugar/better API
so it should be easily prollyfillable.  As such, I am suggesting that we
draft a proposal to do so, explain in detail how it would work (I gave a
high-level suggestion), provide test cases, etc... That's what prollyfills
are all about - a way to evolve outside the browser impl itself based on
competition and data which makes that part easier and makes sure we don't
take turns that users have problems with

... and ...

5)  should we reach that point (it is entirely possible we dont) the actual
implementation should be *comparatively *low cost.

Does it make sense?  Do you feel like I am hand-waving away any of your
concerns?  I hope not because the idea there is precisely to help address
concerns like these (as well as many others).


-Brian
