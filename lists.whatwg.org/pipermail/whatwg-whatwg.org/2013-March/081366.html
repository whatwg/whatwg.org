<PRE>I fully agree that any asynchronous JSON [de]serialization should be
stream-based, not string-based.

Now, if the main heavy duty work is dealing with the large object, this
can certainly be kept on a worker thread. I suspect, however, that this
is not always feasible.

Consider, for instance, a browser implemented as a web application,
FirefoxOS-style. The data that needs to be collected to save its current
state is held in the DOM. For performance and consistency, it is not
practical to keep the DOM synchronized at all times with a worker
thread. Consequently, data needs to be collected on the main thread and
then sent to a worker thread.

Similarly, for a 3d game, until workers can perform some off-screen
WebGL, I suspect that a considerable amount of complex game data needs
to reside on the main thread, because sending the appropriate subsets
from a worker to the main thread on demand might not be reactive enough
for 60 fps. I have no experience with such complex games, though, so my
intuition could be wrong.

Best regards,
 David
