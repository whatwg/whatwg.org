Then you focus there, and the placeholder text should vanish. Why? because I've lost count of the number of users I see trying to select the placeholder text so they can delete it, and then start typing.

I believe this issue&#8212;in the limited situations it presents itself&#8212;is more a factor of the treatment of the placeholder itself than the existence of a placeholder.

One of the key benefits of the HTML5 placeholder attribute is the standardisation of its presentation and behaviour, so it can eventually become more predictable to users. Right now, Safari uses an input with a placeholder string for its URL bar (&quot;Search Google or enter an address&quot;), Chrome uses one in its settings interface (&quot;Search settings&quot;), Firefox uses one for its awesomebar (&quot;Go to a Web Site&quot;) and for its search field (&quot;Google&quot;). Opera uses one for its search field too (&quot;Search with Google&quot;). Internet Explorer seems to be the only browser left that _doesn't_ do this (although it used to in IE8, when its search field said, e.g. &quot;Live Search&quot;).

Facebook uses a placeholder for pretty much every form they have (including their search form and wall submission form). Wikipedia uses it for its search form too.

In almost every case the placeholder remains visible until the user has begun typing, as I strongly believe it ought to be remain in the specification, since it provides the contextual hint for as long as possible.

That it has historically been implemented in a way that implies selectable content is, I believe, chiefly due to the lack of support for a &quot;right&quot; way to do this (which has led many developers to implement the placeholder text simply by setting the field's value to the placeholder text as the simplest implementation).
