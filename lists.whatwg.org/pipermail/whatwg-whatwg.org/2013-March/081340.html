The encapsulation advantages are identical for @font-face and the rest of
@scoped.  Redefining &quot;font-family: serif&quot; to a different serif font using
@font-face is just like redefining &lt;b&gt; to use a brighter color instead of a
bold font.  In both cases, you could argue that you don't need @scoped, but
those arguments are against all of @scoped, not specific to font-family.

One of the big problems with @font-face is that it's not obvious
&gt;<i> whether the @font-face rules should be scoped to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1. font-family declarations in the scoped style sheet, or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2. elements in the style sheet's scope, whether the declarations
</I>&gt;<i>      came from the scoped style sheet or not
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think #2 should be obvious to anybody who understands CSS.  In any case,
if a couple people expect #1, that's fine--they'll try it, immediately see
what actually happens and learn that it's #2.  That's the same level of
education that every feature requires.

Option (2) is more reasonably implementable, but I'm not sure it's
&gt;<i> what authors expect.  In particular, it implies changes to fonts
</I>&gt;<i> that are inherited in from outside the scoped style sheet.  It's not
</I>&gt;<i> clear to me that this behavior is useful enough to authors to be
</I>&gt;<i> worth the (still not insubstantial) work of implementing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's natural that I'd be able to make changes to inherited fonts, just like
I can make changes to anything else inherited from other stylesheets.  You
can already change fonts that are already defined (eg. you can redefine
&quot;serif&quot;), that isn't new to @scoped.

This just seems like an arbitrary exception, disabling one random piece of
CSS that's just as useful and natural to use with @scoped as everything
else.
