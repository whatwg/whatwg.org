To be specific, testing WebKit (in Chrome 24) and Firefox 19 (
<A HREF="https://zewt.org/~glenn/test-drawimage-exception.html">https://zewt.org/~glenn/test-drawimage-exception.html</A>):

- In Chrome, drawImage(img, dx, dy) before the image is downloaded does
nothing.
- In Chrome, drawImage(img, dx, dy, dw, dh) before the image is downloaded
does nothing.
- In Chrome, drawImage(img, dx, dy) after the image fails to download does
nothing.
- In Chrome, drawImage(img, dx, dy, dw, dh) after the image fails to
download throws an exception.

- In Firefox, drawImage(img, dx, dy) before the image is downloaded does
nothing.
- In Firefox, drawImage(img, dx, dy, dw, dh) before the image is downloaded
does nothing.
- In Firefox, drawImage(img, dx, dy) after the image fails to download
throws an exception.
- In Firefox, drawImage(img, dx, dy, dw, dh) after the image fails to
download throws an exception.

IE9 matches Firefox.

It looks like the pattern is to not throw an exception for drawing before
the image finishes loading, but to throw an exception if the image fetch
did complete, but failed.  Chrome in the 3rd case above seems like the
exception.

I imagine one of the Chrome cases is a bug, since it doesn't make sense
that the three-argument and five-argument versions have different behavior.
 (I really hope that's just a bug, and not weird web-compat.)  I think the
spec should also reflect what browsers are converging on: throw an
exception if the image is in the &quot;broken&quot; state, but not in &quot;unavailable&quot;
or &quot;partially available&quot;.

  # Moreover, Opera has lazy loading of images (only loading images
&gt;<i>   # that are rendered or have some event handlers or were created with
</I>&gt;<i>   # new Image() etc), so we'd probably want to just load the image when
</I>&gt;<i>   # the script tries  to draw it instead of throwing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
By then it's too late to load the image in time to draw it, since drawImage
needs to be able to be completed synchronously.  Also, even if you happen
to be able to safely get the image synchronously (eg. if it's in memory
cache or something), the draw is would still be required to not happen,
since img.complete was false.
