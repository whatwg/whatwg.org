As Rafa&#322; noted, I was referring to the behaviour of the application chrome itself (e.g. its built-in address bar), not its implementation of the HTML5 placeholder attribute.

&gt;<i> So maybe a placeholder opacity of 0.5 on hover, and opacity of 0.0 on focus would be a suitable browser default. (web authors should still be able to style the behavior like I just did)
</I>

This behaviour still makes it effectively impossible to use placeholders in combination with autofocus, which I think is unnecessary.

I can say I've never observed this issue myself in usability testing, but I'm not willing to outright discount the possibility that it's a real issue. Does anyone have any empirical evidence/test results that show the issue of users trying to select text is more prevalent than the issue of users forgetting what the placeholder said once it's been hidden, especially while using the HTML5 placeholder attribute?

As I said previously, I predict that these issues would be sorted out simply by the widespread adoption of the placeholder attribute (and therefore the standardisation of its behaviour). Simulating placeholders has been variously done by dynamically setting the input to have the placeholder as its value&#8212;with or without dynamically styling the content differently&#8212;or by positioning an actual label element over the field. In both cases, the implementation effort required to make the field retain its placeholder but not be selectable in Javascript is higher than to simply blank the value on focus and restore it on blur if the field is left empty. As people transition to the placeholder attribute, the variation in the implementations by different page authors will be removed and UAs should be able to standardise the behaviour to match their own application UI.

Here's a discussion on the usability of each option, with a few different references: <A HREF="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/21299/removing-placeholder-text-on-focus">http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/21299/removing-placeholder-text-on-focus</A>

I'm skeptical that this is genuinely a significant issue with users, chiefly because I've never really seen any page authors feel the need to implement anything like this, and because as stated earlier Safari, Firefox and Chrome all use non-hiding placeholders in various places in their browser chrome without any sort of special treatment on focus.

Surprisingly, the only example I could find of a developer doing something both on focus *and* once the user starts typing is Opera in its address bar and search field, which behaves as you describe; the placeholder text goes lighter on focus.

Nevertheless, the _only_ browser I can find which actively removes its placeholder text on focus is IE 8 (in its search field). I can't believe that there needs to be a different implementation for fields in the browser's own chrome as for in-page form fields.
