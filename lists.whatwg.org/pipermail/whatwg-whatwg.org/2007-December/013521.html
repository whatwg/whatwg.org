<PRE>&gt;<i> As a web author I have *never* relied on the HTML, ECMAScript or CSS
</I>&gt;<i> specs. What I do is look on 'A List Apart', 'htmlhelp.com' and tutorials
</I>&gt;<i> spread around the web to see the current state of browser support. This
</I>&gt;<i> is my reality as a designer and I do not expect HTML5, in any form, will
</I>&gt;<i> change that.
</I>
I have to say that, in my case, I've always relied on the specs, read them 
fully and then tried to implement them.  You usually get a pretty good idea 
of what works and what doesn't.  Not to diminish the value of alistapart -- 
they carry pretty good techniques.

&gt;<i> We can't use not following a standard as an argument not
</I>&gt;<i> to make one, especially when that standard is optional anyway. Can
</I>&gt;<i> anyone guarantee that Microsoft, Apple or Nokia will fully comply with
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 if we don't recommend a video codec as some have requested?
</I>
This is understandably true.

&gt;<i> Since there is some serious inconsistencies in the arguments being
</I>&gt;<i> presented it is hard not to assume this is all just a stalling tactic in
</I>&gt;<i> support of commercial ends (defacto adoption of h.264).
</I>
De-facto adoption of unfree codecs will, sadly, happen if the recommendation 
doesn't mention free codecs.  We free software users will continue to be 
second-class citizens on the Web (most free software people able to use a 
smidgen of the multimedia content on the Web are able to do so only because 
we've made a proprietary compromise, which should not have been needed).

Intentions matter.  Special interests should give way to the general public's 
interest.

&gt;<i> The argument that we are stuck on is: should we make *recommendations*
</I>&gt;<i> in a standard that won't be followed by all vendors? I believe we should
</I>&gt;<i> and apparently there are precedents for doing so.
</I>
If we cannot move to either a MUST or a SHOULD for Ogg in the recommendation, 
then at least a mention in the same vein of JPEG and GIF in the earlier 
recommendations should be included.  Since that kind of mention is not 
an &quot;order to implement&quot; or anything akin to that, I don't see a reason why 
all interested parties wouldn't approve.

&gt;<i> Having said all that I don't want this thread to continue the video
</I>&gt;<i> codec discussion. What I want is a clearer position statement  from
</I>&gt;<i> WHATWG on the publics role in defining this specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shannon
