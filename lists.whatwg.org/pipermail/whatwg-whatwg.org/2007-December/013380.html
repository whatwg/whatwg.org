</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most people don't mark up abbreviations or acronyms at all, they

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this purpose, it doesn't really matter which is which (not to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mention that different people disagree on which is which -- I say
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;ess quere ell&quot; and &quot;ewe are ell&quot;, others say &quot;sequel&quot; and &quot;earl&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... I hardly see any valid disagreement.
</I>
Your saying &quot;valid&quot; suggests you do see significant disagreement that
you consider to be &quot;invalid&quot;.  While it's invalid in your eyes, it's
presumably valid to the person making it -- which proves Ian's point
that people differ on these definitions.

&gt;<i> A rule of thumb is that abbreviations are usually written with a dot.
</I>
Possibly for some house styles in some languages, but that is far from
universal.  For example you wrote &quot;Mr.&quot; with a dot, which is common in
American English, whereas in UK English it would typically be &quot;Mr&quot;
without a dot.  I don't see how this matters in the slightest to HTML5.

In another message Krzysztof ??elechowski writes:

&gt;<i> The term &quot;initialism&quot; is stranger to HTML so this distinction is
</I>&gt;<i> essential for academic linguistic papers only;
</I>
Yes, but it demonstrates that even in attempting to make the distinction
between acronyms and abbreviations, HTML4 is failing to follow
real-world definitions that people do make.  That's a plausible argument
for lumping them all together and deciding it isn't worth trying to
support these nuances.

I agree that distinction between initialisms and acronyms isn't worth
making in mark-up -- but why do you believe that distinguishing
initialisms-and-acronyms (both labelled as &quot;acronyms&quot;) from
abbreviations is actually useful?

&gt;<i> However, the distinction between an acronym and an abbreviation is
</I>&gt;<i> clear and intuitive.
</I>
The fact that in this thread there are people you're disagreeing with
suggests that however clear it is in your mind, others struggle with it.
