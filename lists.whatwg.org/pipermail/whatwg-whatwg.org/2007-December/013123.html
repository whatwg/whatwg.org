<PRE>Hello,

This is probably going to cause some emotional responses, but I feel like I
need to say this now.

&gt;&gt;<i> I also feel the choice here of the Ogg container format is a bad one, and
</I>that Matroska would be a much better choice.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree about this. Matroska is built upon EBML...
</I>
I do development with web standards, but my career is built on digital media
creation, delivery and consumption on PC, and now on mobile.  In other
words, I'm an HTML/CSS/JavaScript dilettante compared to everyone else here,
but I am a digital media expert.

In the real world, both Ogg and Matroska are of academic interest only.
Even then, almost nobody knows are cares what they are.

Both of these psuedo-&quot;l33t&quot; format choices appear to be used primarily for
packagers of a tiny percentage of illegally-distributed media.  But even
there, their use seems to be declining.

My point:  If someone were paying me lots of money to guide how they spent
resources related to digital media, the only responsible recommendation
would be that the time spent on accommodating these formats should be zero,
or as close to zero as possible.
