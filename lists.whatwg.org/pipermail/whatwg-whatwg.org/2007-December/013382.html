Oh, I misunderstood what you meant in that part... but I did go on to
directly address your point.

&gt;<i> I've also seen people claim that before the design of Theora, an
</I>&gt;<i> exhaustive patent search was done and it was deliberately coded to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid existing patents, or that it is completely free of known
</I>&gt;<i> patents. I think both of these things are true of Vorbis, but I do not
</I>&gt;<i> believe they are true of Theora.

Here's where we need to get the lawyers all in the same room to even
begin talking about it in any detail-- and I think we absolutely
should get all those lawyers in the room.

&gt;<i> I think the press release may increase confusion on these sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> points.
</I>
I don't think it *is* possible to increase confusion but we're [Xiph]
not going to sink because we can't be bothered to keep bailing.  We
[the larger group] are at an impasse because no one is willing to talk
details for fear of liability.  We [the larger group] need to find a
way past that.

&gt;<i> (The press release also talks about MPEG as if it were a monolithic
</I>&gt;<i> thing and not several families of codecs and container formats, but I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't complain about that because it's less likely to confuse the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion in a material way.)
</I>
Yes, the statement suffers and benefits from brevity.  Bevity is the
best starting point for a conversation.  Now we have to find a way to
get all the players willing to discuss details.

&gt;<i> Darn, I was all ready to pull on my wrestling singlet. :-)
</I>
I'm not *nearly* drunk enough to be hearing those words.
