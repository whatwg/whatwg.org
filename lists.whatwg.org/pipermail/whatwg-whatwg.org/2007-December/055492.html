First, let me welcome all our new members. For those of you not familiar 
with how things work in the WHATWG, a quick recap: basically, I promise to 
(eventually) reply to all substantive e-mails sent to this list, and 
update the spec apropriately. Your part in this is to make sure you read 
the replies I send before responding, to make sure you are not recovering 
old ground -- we don't benefit from going around in circles.

If your e-mail hasn't yet received a reply, you can look at the list of 
outstanding e-mails (updated daily) on this page:

With that said:

</I>&gt;<i> reason things are looking cheerless for the web indeed.
</I>
Actually those are pretty much the only reasons being taken into account 
here. Sadly, Ogg doesn't keep the Web free of IP licensing horrors, due to 
the submarine patent issue -- as Microsoft experienced with MP3 and 
with the Eolas patent over the past few years, for instance, even things 
that seem to have well-understood patent landscapes can be unexpectedly 
attacked by patent trolls.

This does suggest we need patent reform, but in practice this is out of 
scope for HTML5's development. We can't design our spec on the assumption 
that the patent system will be reformed.


&gt;<i> I don't exactly see why the web should embrace non-free standards just 
</I>&gt;<i> because the big players made the &quot;mistake&quot; of licensing 
</I>&gt;<i> definitely-encumbered formats and are unwilling to &quot;take further risks&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> (I am aware this is a pretty hard wording and that things aren't quite 
</I>&gt;<i> that easy.)
</I>
In the absence of IP constraints, there are strong technical reasons to 
prefer H.264 over Ogg. For a company like Apple, where the MPEG-LA 
licensing fee cap for H.264 is easily reached, the technical reasons are 
very compelling.


&gt;<i> The old wording was a SHOULD requirement. No MUST. If the big players 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to take the perceived risk (their decision) they'd still be 
</I>&gt;<i> 100% within the spec. Thus I fail to see why there was need for action.
</I>
The problem is that if the big players don't follow the spec, even the 
SHOULD requirements, then the spec is basically pointless. What we want 
isn't that some people support Ogg, what we fundamentally want is that 
_everyone_ support the same codec, whatever that may be.


&gt;<i> &gt; One way to get a company like Apple to want to take the risk of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementing Theora would be to cause there to be a large pool of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing Theora content out there. Obviously, this presents a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bootstrapping problem (aka a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a world where content is served on a per-user basis (streaming, DRM 
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted media files) I don't think this is much of an argument. HTML5 
</I>&gt;<i> is a future standard which will serve future content.
</I>
I don't see how this affects Apple's stance here. Today they can get 
significant traction with just H.264 (for example, Google is also moving 
to H.264 and Apple can therefore implement YouTube applications on iPhone 
without using anything but H.264). With Ogg, they get very little 
traction, yet significant financial risk.


&gt;<i> &gt; I think the current wording in the spec is actually biased towards the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small players more than the big ones, but if you think it's the other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way around then I probably have struck the right balance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was specifically thinking of the &quot;additional submarine patent risk for 
</I>&gt;<i> large companies&quot; part. Nobody wants to get struck by a submarine, so 
</I>&gt;<i> either this requirement should be extended to all sort of entities or 
</I>&gt;<i> dropped completely (as its hard by definition to make an informed 
</I>&gt;<i> statement about submarine patents).
</I>
Small companies aren't targetted by patent trolls. Only big (really big) 
companies are. It's a big-company concern, just like &quot;no per-user 
licensing&quot; is a small-company concern. That's just the reality of the 
situation, it's not intended to be a bias.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - The Xiph developers were extremely zealous and almost fiduciarily

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; submarine patents.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While this is very true, and admirable, and impressive, it is sadly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not a guarantee. Certain companies (Nokia and Apple among them) have

</I>
No, but you presumably would avoid living in a house that had matchstick 
walls and a large concrete ceiling. It's a matter of risk management.


&gt;<i> In other words, here we go.  FEAR.
</I>
But it is fear felt by the companies themselves, not fear that they are 
attempting to pass onto the userbase.


&gt;<i> &gt; as they might exist for other formats like MPEG4/H.264.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> UNCERTAINTY.
</I>
Indeed, the entire issue here is one of uncertainty.


&gt;<i> &gt; The difference is that while Apple (for example) have already assumed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the risk of submarine patents with H.264, they currently have taken no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; risks with respect to the aforementioned codecs, and they do not wish 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to take on that risk. Given the extremely large sums of money that are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awarded for patent violations (cf. Microsoft's recent settlements), it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is understandable that companies with the high profile of Apple and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nokia would not wish to take on such risks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DOUBT.
</I>
Yes, the big players here are fearful and doubtful of the uncertain patent 
situation surrounding Ogg. That is in fact the entire problem.


&gt;<i> It's all unsubstantiated terror-mongering. How curious that the very 
</I>&gt;<i> same companies who are rallying against free multimedia and throwing 
</I>&gt;<i> hissy fits because of the &quot;patent monster&quot; are the ones most deeply 
</I>&gt;<i> supportive of software patents.  They have huge patent portfolios to 
</I>&gt;<i> wage a war against any patent troll, so why are they trolling now?
</I>
Unfortunately patent portfolios don't help against trolling patent holding 
companies. It's also not clear to me that the companies to which you refer 
are in fact the most supportive of software patents; indeed, as far as I 
can tell most companies involved here have extensive lobbying efforts 
ongoing to encourage patent reform. However, that is quite out of scope 
for the matter at hand, namely the HTML5 specification. As noted above, we 
can't base what we do in the spec on ongoing lobbying efforts whose 
success is as yet highly unpredictable.


&gt;<i> &gt; MP3 is and old codec as well, yet the threat of submarine patents 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covering MP3 surfaced recently, much to Microsoft's chagrin. Unless 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the codecs are older than the patent lifetime, there is unfortunately 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no guarentee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course there is no guarantee.  There is *never* any guarantee.
</I>
There can be a guarentee, e.g. with technologies that have outlasted the 
patent lifetime (Motion JPEG, e.g., or, as I understand it, H.261). There 
is also a matter of risk vs reward; with 


&gt;<i> &gt; Patent trolling companies are patient and will wait for bigger 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; targets, as has been seen time and time again. (As an example of this, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Eolas patent case is still fresh on everyone's minds, I'm sure.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wow, sounds like something's wrong with software patents around the 
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>
Hear hear.


&gt;<i> Watch out, someone may be holding a submarine patent on encoding 
</I>&gt;<i> hypertext.
</I>
Luckily, patents on hypertext have long expired.


&gt;<i> Fact: Vorbis is the *only* codec whose patent status has been widely 
</I>&gt;<i> researched, nearly to exhaustion.
</I>
Sadly there's really no such thing as an exhaustive patent search.


&gt;<i> Repeating the same FUD over and over again (which you just did) may lead 
</I>&gt;<i> the world to believe this to be false, but it's TRUE.  You should at 
</I>&gt;<i> least have talked to Monty @ Xiph before jumping to rash conclusions.
</I>
The first person I spoke to upon making the change to the spec was in fact 
from Xiph. They understand the concern, and, as I understand it, agree 
that the current text in the spec is an accurate summary of the issue.


&gt;<i> &gt; Ogg is not necessarily the only solution that avoids patent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encumbrence. There are codecs that have been in existence for longer 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than the patent lifetime, for instance. Dave Singer posted a quite 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thorough analysis of this issue recently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but Vorbis is the only one offering competitive performance, which 
</I>&gt;<i> you explicitly laid out as a requirement (and, frankly, I coulnd't agree 
</I>&gt;<i> more with you).
</I>
Vorbis isn't really the problem. The real issue is video codecs (Theora).


&gt;<i> &gt; Apple, Nokia, Microsoft and other large companies have stated that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they will not support Theora purely based on the requirement in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec. Having or not having this requirement in the spec thus makes no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference to independent authors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it does.
</I>
How?


&gt;<i> Let me rephrase your statement to be worded in a more *honest* way.  
</I>&gt;<i> Vorbis provides the perfect escape for proprietary audio prisons.  
</I>&gt;<i> Apple and Nokia are having problems with consumers and authors actually 
</I>&gt;<i> waking up and using free, non-patent-encumbered, widely available, 
</I>&gt;<i> unrestricted, non-proprietary technology.  Since Vorbis directly 
</I>&gt;<i> threatens their ability to sell traps, they are extorting your 
</I>&gt;<i> compliance with threats of not supporting the HTML5 spec.
</I>
I don't know what you base your conclusions on, but I assure you that to 
the best of my knowledge, that's not the current situation. I have been in 
this business a long time, and I've been played for a fool many times 
before. This particular issue does not have the tell-tale signs of players 
acting in bad faith. Indeed, Apple employees have probably done more to 
resolve this issue than anyone else so far.


&gt;<i> It doesn't.  The effort that would most effectively address these issues 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a &quot;patch -r&quot; on the related spec revision, combined with a 
</I>&gt;<i> polite mail: &quot;no, Nokia, no, Apple, we're very sorry but you are wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> and we're not going to let you break the spec's legs before it's even 
</I>&gt;<i> born&quot;.
</I>
The spec is pointless if we don't have interoperability. The goal here 
isn't to support Ogg, or H.264, or anything else. The goal is to get a 
baseline video codec that everyone can use and implement, and that will 
work in all browsers. For that, we need a codec that is known to not 
require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the 
open source development model, that is of sufficient quality as to be 
usable, and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large 
companies.

Actually we'd be right where we are now, since the HTML specs never

</I>
The whole point of the change was to make the point that we need something 
that will not screw you. Ogg isn't a solution, as it won't be implemented 
by Apple and Microsoft. If we require Ogg, then what will happen is the 
big players will support something else, then that will become the 
de-facto standard, and you will get screwed. What we _want_ is for 
everyone to support the same codec. We don't get that by having a 
SHOULD-level requirement for Ogg.

As should be clear from the text in the spec, I entirely agree with your 
concerns, and whatever codec we eventually settle on will have to be a 
royalty-free codec.

I don't think the reason you cite is the actual reason for the deadlock, 
but you are right in saying that we are failing to get a de facto standard 
because not everyone is agreeing on what to implement.

We can't, by definition, have a de facto standard unless everyone agrees. 
That's what &quot;de facto&quot; means.


&gt;<i> I am not saying that ogg should be enforced onto anyone, if nokia wishes

</I>&gt;<i> who are opposed to vendor lock-in or monopoly positions.
</I>
We know that all standards-compatible browsers will support the standards, 
but what about all the other browsers? Surely what we want isn't just for 
a small set of browsers to support a codec but for _all_ the browsers to 
suppor the same codec.


&gt;<i> OGG is the choice of freedom, enabling that freedom for all

Ogg is _a_ choice, which provides freedom for some but not everyone. We 
need a codec that works for everyone.

This isn't the W3C, this is the WHATWG. :-) I don't think the W3C has made

Sadly today there are no codecs that address all the needs of everyone

I think that's what everyone wants. The problem is that Ogg is not such a 
codec -- Apple, for instance, can't implement Ogg without fear of being 
sued.

</I>
Well, they're browser vendors. At the end of the day, the browser vendors 
have a very effective absolute veto on anything in the browser specs, 
since they get to decide what they implement and what they don't. We can 
only specify things that they're willing to implement. This goes for all 
browser vendors, Mozilla, Opera, Apple, etc.

I assure you that the change was made in good faith; I (sadly) received no 
money for the change. I really wish I had.

The idea here is to have a big impact on the Web. Ogg, sadly, can't have a 
big impact in the current climate, because some of the biggest players 
refuse to implement it. We must find a solution that really can have a big 
impact.


I hope this addresses most of the concerns that are raised. I understand 
that some people will see a conspiracy here; naturally I can't really 
reassure you that there isn't one, that's the nature of conspiracies.
