</I>
Nor any of the minor ones, nor most open source ones.

Also, I assume through Konqueror relying on GStreamer that Konqueror  
doesn't support it itself (or through a required dependancy, which is  
needed to actually conform to such a clause that existed). WebKit  
trunk also supports Ogg in &lt;video&gt; if you have the needed QT component  
(which is supporting it as much as Konqueror supports it). Opera 9.5  
beta has built in support for Ogg/etc. and supports nothing else.

There are still large questions about when Fx will support (which I  
assume from your later post is what you were referring to) &lt;video&gt;  
natively, though it may well be in Fx 3.0 in early '08.

</I>
Oh, look, they are already losing custom through not supporting WMA.  
It doesn't look like they particularly care about that, does it?

&gt;&gt;<i> and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only standards that MPEG-LA collects money for that Apple receives  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> share of whatsoever is &quot;MPEG-4 Systems&quot; and IEEE 1394 (Firewire).

No, it is me trying to understand what you're meaning.

&gt;<i> I said Apple doesn't want Ogg Vorbis because they don't control the  
</I>&gt;<i> tech, and
</I>&gt;<i> because they would very much rather have consumers &quot;prefer&quot; (in the  
</I>&gt;<i> sense of
</I>&gt;<i> being screwed with no choice) DRM-encumbered AAC (note it's not the  
</I>&gt;<i> codec,
</I>&gt;<i> but the controlling of the consumer that matters here).
</I>
AAC doesn't support DRM natively. It's a proprietary extension. iTunes  
has always ripped CDs by default into non-DRM-encumbered AAC (i.e., an  
open standard, and compatible with numerous players). Apple has never,  
anywhere where it has a choice, favoured DRM-encumbered standards.
