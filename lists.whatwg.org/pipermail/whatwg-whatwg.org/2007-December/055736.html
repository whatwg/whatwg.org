Corrections to this:

1) Apple representatives have stated that we are ok with the SHOULD  
clause remaining. (We do think it is better to remove it for now but  
we can live with it either way).

2) At the same time we are driving work to find a codec that could  
meet the qualifications to be a MUST (which may or may not end up  
being Ogg Theora but will certainly be royalty-free).

3) Absence of a SHOULD clause doesn't force anyone to opt out of  
implementing Ogg Theora. Those vendors that wish to do so remain free  
to implement Theora or any other codec. I don't think Mozilla or Opera  
will back off of their plans to do so.

</I>
Apple's goals are:

1) We don't want to significantly increase our risk of being sued for  
possibly billions of dollars.
2) We want to find a codec that everyone can implement (including open  
source implementations) which does not create the risk in #1.

You could argue that #1 is self-serving, since it is a risk that  
largely does not affect smaller corporations or individuals. However,  
I think it is a reasonable concern. And we are doing something  
constructive about it by working towards #2. The W3C will be  
coordinating further work to review available codecs.

Maciej
