<PRE>I would just like to say:

Me too.

The quoted letter is a sensible address to the bigger problem underlying 
our &quot;difference of opinion&quot;.

El Mar 11 Dic 2007, Fernando escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> Please reconsider the decision to exclude the recommendation of the
</I>&gt;<i> Theora/OGG Vorbis codec in HTML 5 guidelines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect that in a sophisticated group such as this one:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * skepticism with how well the interests of powerful corporations match
</I>&gt;<i> those of individuals that are not their employees or shareholders;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * an understanding of the economic and civil rights damage being done to
</I>&gt;<i> the rights of individuals by proprietary formats; and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * an understanding of the wisdom behind the original wording of this
</I>&gt;<i> portion of the document;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will enable you to see the need to readmit common sense and wisdom into
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 5 by including OGG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having said that, I want to illustrate how open standards or the lack
</I>&gt;<i> thereof can affect someone with a disability such as myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While there have been large corporations that have adopted relatively
</I>&gt;<i> inclusive designs in their technology, i.e. designs that enable rather than
</I>&gt;<i> block persons who are blind or have other disabilities; this has often
</I>&gt;<i> taken place only after legal threats or actual litigation from government
</I>&gt;<i> agencies and other groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is however, that legislative tools are not always available to
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, are often outdated, too slow, or inadequate to do the work that
</I>&gt;<i> is truly the responsibility of groups such as this one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a large corporation ignores the needs of persons with disabilities in
</I>&gt;<i> realms where open standards prevail, we have options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It bothered me but it didn't stop me when in the 1990s, there were a number
</I>&gt;<i> of inaccessible e-mail clients for users of screen reading software such as
</I>&gt;<i> myself.  Blind users could always use alternative products such as Pine or
</I>&gt;<i> Emacs to handle e-mail because the e-mail protocol is open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not the case with proprietary formats.  In formats such as those
</I>&gt;<i> promoted by Microsoft, Apple, and, to my surprise, Nokia, any and all
</I>&gt;<i> groups, be those persons with disabilities, or those who in any other way
</I>&gt;<i> do not fit the user profile being targeted by those corporations are
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable to being left out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I should clarify that, they are not just vulnerable to being left out
</I>&gt;<i> but in fact, they are often left out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately this is not about the right to play video games, although
</I>&gt;<i> there is an entire other conversation there, but the right to access
</I>&gt;<i> information that is increasingly central to the educational options,
</I>&gt;<i> professional opportunities, and social avenues available to everyone. Allow
</I>&gt;<i> every human brain its rights to develop, contribute, and participate fully
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of its race, economic profile, the characteristics of its body,
</I>&gt;<i> or the computing platform it has access to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not to say that an open standard guarantees access, but it
</I>&gt;<i> facilitates it greatly; because from what I have observed and experienced,
</I>&gt;<i> there have always been and there will always be those who value inclusion
</I>&gt;<i> over control, competition over rent-seeking behavior, and courage over
</I>&gt;<i> moral laziness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for taking the above into account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fernando H. F. Botelho
