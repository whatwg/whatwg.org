This entire discussion is founded on a major misapprehension:  that 
there has been a decision, and that decision was to exclude.  This is 
simply not true;  there is no decision either to include or exclude. 
There is a recognition that work is needed.

I and others have spent a great deal of time on this problem already, 
working with a number of people, including the W3C staff.  Many of us 
-- maybe all of us -- agree we need to find a solution that enables 
broad interoperability and is in accord with w3c and web practices. 
We have not yet reached consensus on having found it.  That's all.
