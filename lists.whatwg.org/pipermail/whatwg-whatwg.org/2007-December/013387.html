<PRE>Marc,

 

[The &quot;anti-Ogg camp&quot;] are acting with their shareholders in mind. They have
everything to gain and nothing to loose as they all have their platforms,
i.e. Window, OS X, Itunes, cellular handset, that they control/use their
propiety formats.

 

I guess you're implying that AVC/H.264 is &quot;proprietary&quot;, which is false.

                          

AVC is a standard under both the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and
ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).

                                   

Also, AVC is a de-facto standard. Every iPod supports it. Every PSP supports
it. Every HD-DVD and Blu-Ray player supports it. The mobile ecosystem has
long since adopted MPEG-4, and most video services either use AVC now or are
on track to. Even Adobe, who's had lots of success to this point with
proprietary formats, has finally adopted it a replacement of VP6.

 

Comparing apples-to-apples, Ogg Theora isn't a standard. It was a
proprietary On2 video codec, and it didn't become a standard just because
On2 gave everyone a royalty-free license, so you can see how some people
might still think of it as proprietary. The fact that it's open-source isn't
relevant, since of course there are open-source implementations of AVC as
well. It was already old technology when On2 gave it away, so it's
MPEG-1-like inefficiency makes it retro (to put it kindly) on the PC, and
completely unsuitable for typicaly 3G mobile throughput.

 

I hope this has been helpful,

 

- Charles
