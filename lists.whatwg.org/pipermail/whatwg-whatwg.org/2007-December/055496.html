<PRE>First, I would like to thank you for the feedback, and I must admit it 
is a rather sensitive situation, more so then I imagined at first. But 
because of the nature of submarine patents, I don't quite see how you 
can actually find a codec that fits the requirements? You can't use an 
encumbered codec obviously, and the rest is up for grabs by people who 
misuse legislation for their own benefit? So what else is there 
(excepting codecs that are outdated in every way that is)? That said, my 
vote still lies with ogg.

&gt;<i> &gt; Ogg is not necessarily the only solution that avoids patent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encumbrence. There are codecs that have been in existence for longer 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than the patent lifetime, for instance. Dave Singer posted a quite 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thorough analysis of this issue recently.
</I>
I have seen this argument pop up now and again, but I have failed to 
actually find the URL to this, could someone post it please?



PS: it's stuff like this that could very well be used in the case 
against the patents, it's mad how much damage they inflict
