Yes, I agree that consensus will be hard.  I have 
spent quite some effort so far and I see quite a 
bit more to come.  I don't think there is much 
conflict of interest at play here (in the classic 
sense), just conflict of perception and preferred 
direction.

&gt;<i>  And all that we want is that Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora, being the
</I>&gt;<i>ideal balance between least-encumbered and technically sufficient options, be
</I>&gt;<i>mentioned in the document that will be read by millions -- even if it wasn't
</I>&gt;<i>a SHOULD but a MAY or an ITWOULDBENICE.  They more than deserve it.
</I>
That is still a possibility.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, here's a challenge.  Does Apple really *only* want to be able to claim
</I>&gt;<i>SHOULD conformance?
</I>
No, we went with the consensus opinion at the 
HTML meeting that MUST would be better, if it can 
be achieved.

&gt;<i>Reinstate the paragraph and put MAY instead of SHOULD,
</I>&gt;<i>then go crazy authoring H.264 content for the VIDEO tag.  That resolution
</I>&gt;<i>lets you have SHOULD conformance.  If you refuse, we know that it's a market
</I>&gt;<i>and monopoly thing.  If you accept, we know you were being straightforward
</I>&gt;<i>all along.
</I>
Most of us are less than satisfied with SHOULD, 
and MAY is in the opposite direction to that 
desired.
