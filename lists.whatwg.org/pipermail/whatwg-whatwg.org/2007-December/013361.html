&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That's no reason to NOT SUGGEST Ogg Vorbis / Theora.  No one here is saying 
</I>&gt;<i> that HTML5 should forbid proprietary codecs -- all we're claiming for is the 
</I>&gt;<i> judicious and well-deserved mention of two free technologies in a document 
</I>&gt;<i> that will be read by MILLIONS of people to come.  And you just killed that.
</I>
You're exaggerating, you are.  If Web developers read the specification
(or any specification, for that matter), the Web would not look like it
does.  But they do not; the prefer Dreamweaver, and whatever you have
got.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Small companies aren't targetted by patent trolls. Only big (really big)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; companies are. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And therefore they're deserving of more protection?  Sounds like a racket to 
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am sorry you perceive them this way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Be honest, don't tell me you're sorry because you are not.  You're sorry when 
</I>&gt;<i> something personally sad happens to someone you know, not when there's a 
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly valid disagreement on an action you took.
</I>
Clairvoyant?


&gt;<i> I don't care much for the content in my own computer, since I encode my things 
</I>&gt;<i> in free formats and using free technology, but I will care when I start 
</I>&gt;<i> playing videos on my computer and it says to me &quot;you need codec X, which 
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately is not available for your Linux computer&quot;.  If you keep the 
</I>&gt;<i> section you censored, the likelihood of that happening is much, much lower.
</I>
Not really.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, the big players here are fearful and doubtful of the uncertain patent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation surrounding Ogg. That is in fact the entire problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How curious that the Ogg Vorbis authors never felt that fear, uncertainty and 
</I>&gt;<i> doubt.  Perhaps they didn't because they actually did their homework and 
</I>&gt;<i> researched the patent minefield before stepping on one of those mines, 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of saying &quot;it can't be done, we're too afraid&quot;?
</I>
Irrelevant, dismissed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure.  We will just have to wait till we all have 50 megabits/s at home to 
</I>&gt;<i> watch 320x240 videos or something.  Maybe we can convince podcast authors to 
</I>&gt;<i> start casting in RIFF WAVE -- I hear it has awesome quality at 8000 Hz mono!
</I>
Then don't.  Read books, it will do you more good.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sadly there's really no such thing as an exhaustive patent search.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's also no such thing as a perfect prophylactic, yet people still use 
</I>&gt;<i> condoms because they're good enough.  
</I>
That does not mean you can force somebody to use them when he is afraid.

&gt;<i> It'd be fantastic if someone from Xiph pronounced himself on the matter in 
</I>&gt;<i> this forum.
</I>
But it would not change anything.

&gt;<i> Tactics change over time.  Anyway, it's not our duty to concern ourselves with 
</I>&gt;<i> the *intentions* of the players (though I did shine some light on the issue 
</I>&gt;<i> because it's good to know what the players want). But it is our duty to 
</I>&gt;<i> reflect over the lasting consequences of our actions.
</I>
This particular action, as already noted, is temporary and it is not
meant to have any.


&gt;<i> Stalling Ogg for a pie-in-the-sky nonexistent solution is not the answer.  Ogg 
</I>&gt;<i> is already working in many browsers (both Vorbis and Theora).  Despite 
</I>&gt;<i> continued and persistent assertions by bullies (backed on NOTHING but hot 
</I>&gt;<i> air), Ogg is still the best answer.
</I>
Nobody claimed it is the answer, it is just a workaround.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me be humorous for a moment.  This whole discussion (which is actually NOT 
</I>&gt;<i> representative of the interests of the anti-Ogg bullies) could be summarized 
</I>&gt;<i> as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Apple: the neighborhood punk is out to get us
</I>&gt;<i> - Nokia: yeah
</I>&gt;<i> - MS: indeed
</I>&gt;<i> - (WHATWG): OK let's just not go out of our house
</I>
Nobody said that, but &quot;You are free to stay at home until we come up
with a better solution&quot;.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For that, we need a codec that is known to not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open source development model, that is of sufficient quality as to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usable, and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; companies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BMP?  MJPEG?  WAV?
</I>
You are being told this question it will take some time to answer this
question.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The whole point of the change was to make the point that we need something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that will not screw you. Ogg isn't a solution, as it won't be implemented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by Apple and Microsoft.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, if Apple and Microsoft don't implement Ogg, it will *GUARANTEED* not 
</I>&gt;<i> screw me.  If you put it in the spec, they will have to implement it or -- 
</I>&gt;<i> failing that -- there are simple JS-based fallback solutions that are 
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly degradable.  So there is NO excuse.
</I>
It depends on Web authors, and authors rely on what they can see.
Otherwise everybody would be using Q for quotations by now.


&gt;<i> For the record: I don't see a conspiracy.  All I see is big interests clearly 
</I>&gt;<i> colluding in the open to further restrict choice for the rest of us.
</I>
For the record: 

col&#183;lude    
&#8211;verb (used without object), -lud&#183;ed, -lud&#183;ing. 
1.
to act together through a secret
understanding, esp. with evil or
harmful intent. 
2.
to conspire in a fraud.
