This makes it sound like you are just advocating Ogg, rather than  
advocating royalty-free as a requirement for a baseline codec. That  
doesn't seem like a principled position in favor of open source and  
open content, it just seems like Ogg fandom.

In particular:

1) Theora is a patented encumbered (with a royalty-free patent  
disclaimer), so that's not a basis to contrast it to other codecs that  
may have royalty-free patent availability.

2) I'm not aware of significant patent research having been done on  
Theora, unlike the case with Vorbis. If anyone knows otherwise, please  
cite a reference.

3) Pre-existing widespread use by large companies in practice  
mitigates submarine patent risk more than research. So actually a  
royalty-free license to a widely used codec would be better from a  
patent risk point of view.


I hope those who advocate Ogg for reasons of open source compatibility  
and freedom of content creation would agree that any royalty-free  
technically suitable codec would do. Otherwise, you are just making it  
harder to find a baseline that will work for everyone.

</I>
Incidentally, and for the record, no Apple employee has demanded that  
the Ogg SHOULD-level requirement be removed. We specifically said we  
can live with it, although having it in the spec seems unhelpful.  
We're also working to find a mutually workable solution by proposing  
alternatives and negotiating with the relevant parties. To those of  
you posting angry emails, consider whether you could find a way to  
contribute to resolving the situation.
