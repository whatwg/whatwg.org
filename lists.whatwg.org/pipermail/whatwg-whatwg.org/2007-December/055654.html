It matters in this case because the press release cites large company  
(i.e. potential patent troll magnet) deployment of Vorbis, but then  
the press release mostly talks about video.

It also matters because, as I've said, this is already a point of  
material confusion. For example, I've seen comment threads (not  
involving myself!) on news sites that go something like this:

Poster A: &quot;Theora is not very high quality compared to H.264.&quot;
Poster B: &quot;I disagree! My Vorbis audio player gives great sound  
quality!&quot;
(At this point I assume Poster A facepalms and quits the Internet  
forever.)

I've also seen people claim that before the design of Theora, an  
exhaustive patent search was done and it was deliberately coded to  
avoid existing patents, or that it is completely free of known  
patents. I think both of these things are true of Vorbis, but I do not  
believe they are true of Theora.

I think the press release may increase confusion on these sorts of  
points.

(The press release also talks about MPEG as if it were a monolithic  
thing and not several families of codecs and container formats, but I  
didn't complain about that because it's less likely to confuse the  
discussion in a material way.)

Darn, I was all ready to pull on my wrestling singlet. :-)

Cheers,
Maciej
