<PRE>&quot;Documents and document fragments / Structure&quot; says &quot;Authors must only
use elements in the HTML namespace in the contexts where they are
allowed, as defined for each element.&quot;

That phrase is unclear. It could be interpreted as:

&quot;Authors must { only use elements in the HTML namespace } in { the
contexts where [elements in the HTML namespace] are allowed }&quot;, i.e.
contexts expecting HTML namespaced elements mustn't contain foreign
content.

&quot;Authors must { [...] use elements in the HTML namespace } [only] { in
the contexts where they are allowed }&quot;, i.e. HTML elements must not be
used where they aren't allowed.

&quot;Authors must only { use elements in the HTML namespace in the
contexts where they are allowed }&quot;, i.e. pretty much every imaginable
action in the entire world is disallowed, except for using elements
where allowed.

A suggested replacement: &quot;Authors must not use elements in the HTML
namespace except where allowed by the context defined for the
element&quot;.


Similarly, &quot;Authors must only put elements inside an element if that
element allows them to be there according to its content model&quot; should
be fixed to say something like &quot;Authors must not put elements inside
an element unless that element allows them to be there according to
its content model&quot;.


More generally, all uses of &quot;must only&quot; and &quot;may only&quot; etc seem
dangerous. The spec says &quot;The key words [...] in the normative parts
of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119&quot;, but
instead they have to be interpreted as described by the standard
English grammar rules when they're used in complex phrases like &quot;must
only&quot;, which makes the spec harder to read when you're trying to read
the normative requirements, and can cause misunderstanding. (Does that
make things particularly harder for non-native-English-speaking
people?)

The conformance requirements would be clearer if all occurrences of &quot;x
must only y&quot; and &quot;x may only y&quot; were replaced by &quot;x must not { not y
}&quot; or by &quot;x may y, and x must not { not y }&quot;.

Similarly, &quot;x should only y if z&quot; (e.g. &quot;authors should only use these
elements if the absence of those elements would change the meaning of
the content&quot;) should be replaced by &quot;x should y if z, and should not
do so otherwise&quot; or &quot;x should not y if not z&quot; (depending on which
directions the 'should' applies in).
