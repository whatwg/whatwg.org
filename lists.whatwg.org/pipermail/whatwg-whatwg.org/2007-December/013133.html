I just checked in a change to make globalStorage far simpler -- I dropped 
all the domain manipulation stuff, and made it same-origin instead. I also 
dropped StorageItem and just made the Storage stuff return strings.

For more complex operations, we now have the SQL database APIs.

This makes a number of issues moot.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So, for example, you could have StorageItems which were only

</I>&gt;<i> Depends on your definition of &quot;ordinary&quot; - what about self-signed

</I>&gt;<i> available.
</I>
This is moot now as I have dropped StorageItem. You can only ever get 
access to a storage item if you are in the same origin that it was created 
in. (We could make the type of cert part of the definition of &quot;origin&quot;, if 
desired; this would address this problem for a number of other cases and 
not just make it work for storage.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is an implicit trust relationship here already. There is no

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I interpret this comment as: &quot;since there is already a hole in the hull

</I>&gt;<i> your justification make too many assumptions about the [site owner / 
</I>&gt;<i> server owner / DNS provider] relationships and/or security that are 
</I>&gt;<i> unverifiable. If I run a server at books.jump.to then I accept that they 
</I>&gt;<i> COULD redirect my domain or even insert code but I also expect that I 
</I>&gt;<i> could DETECT IT and possibly sue for breach of contract. That's the key 
</I>&gt;<i> flaw in your argument - all of the exploits above are easy to detect - 
</I>&gt;<i> but no hacking or tampering is required for an untrusted party to access 
</I>&gt;<i> shared global storage. All that's required is a single page anywhere on 
</I>&gt;<i> jump.to at any time to perform a simple walk over the storage array - 
</I>&gt;<i> something which could easily be disguised as a legitimate action. That 
</I>&gt;<i> is the crux of my concern - not that the proposal allows new forms of 
</I>&gt;<i> abuse - but that it makes existing abuses easier to implement and harder 
</I>&gt;<i> to detect and remove.
</I>
This is now moot since it's all based on origin instead of domain parts.


&gt;<i> Remove ALL trust assumptions based on the domain name and use 
</I>&gt;<i> public/private certificates to sign data in and out of storage. This 
</I>&gt;<i> would also allow IP based hosts to use storage.
</I>
This isn't what I did; instead I simply reduced the security model of the 
globalStorage stuff to the same-origin model used everywhere else in HTML.


&gt;<i> Remember, our objectives for persistent storage are simply:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To store an object on a client and retrieve it later, even if the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'session' has since been closed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allow trusted site(s) access to a previously stored client-side data 
</I>&gt;<i> object (such as a user document)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I absolutely insist that trust can never be inferred from DNS or IP 
</I>&gt;<i> information. In fact even the site authors own domain is somewhat 
</I>&gt;<i> suspect since it can change ownership if not renewed (it happened to me 
</I>&gt;<i> when a registrar screwed me over). Therefore we need a system of 
</I>&gt;<i> credentials based on the site owner. Fortunately this is similar to the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem that SSL site certificates solve. Since we already have a way of 
</I>&gt;<i> obtaining and verifying certificates it should not be a big stretch to 
</I>&gt;<i> extend this to private storage. It wouldn't even need to be as complex 
</I>&gt;<i> as an SSL cert since we are only trying to establish that the site 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to access the key possesses the same private or group certificate 
</I>&gt;<i> as the site setting it. Provided each site can have multiple certs then 
</I>&gt;<i> all the requirements of the spec can be met without bleeding out data to 
</I>&gt;<i> abitrary third-parties and dodgy ISPs. Sure your hosting service _could_ 
</I>&gt;<i> steal your private keys but that is unlikely to go undetected for long 
</I>&gt;<i> and would qualify as a crime in most countries (forgery,theft,fraud - 
</I>&gt;<i> take your pick).
</I>
It's not clear to me exactly how this would work. You mean you want to 
require some sort of out-of-band site authentication before doing any 
globalStorage access?

Could you elaborate on exactly how this would work?

This is now moot with the security model changes.


&gt;<i> My personal preference is for 1b -- use globalStorage[''] as the 
</I>&gt;<i> non-shared storage area.
</I>
I've removed all shared storage. We can use cross-domain communication for 
shared storage needs (using the postMessage() stuff on iframes).

</I>
With the removal of StorageItem, we dropped all the flags as well. I think 
if authors want to add metadata to their storage items, it would make 
sense to encourage them to use the more comprehensive database API.

Do the new changes address your concerns?

Sadly it's complicated to implement. It's now moot, anyway.

I don't think there is, but this is now moot in this context. Sharing 
across sites is now only possible with an active approach of running code 
from that site as a proxy.
