Thank you.  We have not yet actually promoted or suggested anything, 
as we are as yet unsure of what would meet all the needs, address 
risks, etc.

Also,  I should note that we are not the only company expressing 
caution.  We are not trying to be obstructive  but rather the 
reverse.  We want a solution which is effective and we are willing to 
work to that end, but some things are probably better done at arm's 
length or by a neutral party.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Is there anything truthful / false in this comment?

</I>&gt;<i>Apple has made the same patent uncertainty statements in the past
</I>&gt;<i>regarding both Vorbis and FLAC.  I see no evidence (as yet) that
</I>&gt;<i>Apple's objection is anything specific to Tremor.  I think they see
</I>&gt;<i>merely that MPEG, of which they are a part, has laid a huge patent
</I>&gt;<i>minefield designed to discourage competition and it's hard to believe
</I>&gt;<i>anyone has navigated through it.
</I>
To be fair, if anything, it's patent owners, not MPEG.  MPEG merely 
takes steps to try to ensure that IPR it is aware of and is needed 
for their specs is RAND licensable.  Anything else is out of scope.

We contribute to the standards, and we implement and license (some 
of) them.  AFAIK we are not members of the pools for either video or 
audio.
