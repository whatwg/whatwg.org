<PRE>Oh, yes, let's not forget what Jeff just said: NOKIA LIED when they called Ogg 
proprietary.  That's as absurd and tendentious as you get.

Smell test, guys.  Smell test.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reason things are looking cheerless for the web indeed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually those are pretty much the only reasons being taken into account
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here. Sadly, Ogg doesn't keep the Web free of IP licensing horrors, due
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the submarine patent issue -- as Microsoft experienced with MP3 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the Eolas patent over the past few years, for instance, even things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that seem to have well-understood patent landscapes can be unexpectedly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attacked by patent trolls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you need to stop work on a HTML5 spec right now because
</I>&gt;<i> *EVERYTHING* has a submarine patent risk to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theora was developed, by all accounts, after as exhaustive of a patent
</I>&gt;<i> search as is possible, and designed to not infringe on any patents.
</I>&gt;<i> That's as close to being sure that you're patent free as you can get.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the least risk option going forward.  Its also the only option
</I>&gt;<i> that I see that can hold true to the w3c's ideals of freedom (which I
</I>&gt;<i> strongly support).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple and Nokia's stated reasons for objecting to Theora are crap...they
</I>&gt;<i> don't pass the smell test.  Ian, you're being taken for a ride, here.
</I>&gt;<i> Just revert the text and go back to Theora as the codec of choice and
</I>&gt;<i> end this charade of trying to look like you're taking everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> concerns into account because its clear that you aren't.  Apple and
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia are, so far, getting their way, despite the huge public outcry
</I>&gt;<i> that you're seeing, and that should tell you something, and tell you
</I>&gt;<i> something loud and clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple and Nokia's reasons for objecting to Theora don't pass the smell
</I>&gt;<i> test.  Nokia even called Ogg &quot;proprietary&quot; in their white paper I've
</I>&gt;<i> sure you've read as well.  This is so badly wrong as to have become the
</I>&gt;<i> butt of jokes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are the real reasons that Nokia and Apple object to Theora?
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly the reasons that they have stated are a smoke-screen because
</I>&gt;<i> they don't even withstand the most basic of scrutiny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want a baseline codec that everyone supports, revert the text and
</I>&gt;<i> then s/SHOULD/MUST/ .  Apple and Nokia may not like it, but that's the
</I>&gt;<i> only real option if you want a codec that everyone can support.  And,
</I>&gt;<i> yes, Apple and Nokia *can* support it, the risk is negligible, and
</I>&gt;<i> technically is not hard to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't exactly see why the web should embrace non-free standards just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; because the big players made the &quot;mistake&quot; of licensing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; definitely-encumbered formats and are unwilling to &quot;take further risks&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (I am aware this is a pretty hard wording and that things aren't quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that easy.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the absence of IP constraints, there are strong technical reasons to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefer H.264 over Ogg. For a company like Apple, where the MPEG-LA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensing fee cap for H.264 is easily reached, the technical reasons are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very compelling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except that there are *KNOWN* IP (god how I hate that term) constraints
</I>&gt;<i> with H.264.  At least with Theora we can avoid any known ones.  All
</I>&gt;<i> codecs have a risk of submarine patents (though with extensive having
</I>&gt;<i> been done for Theora, at least that risk is lowered, if not eliminated
</I>&gt;<i> completely), so that argument is a wash, its on both sides of the
</I>&gt;<i> equation, so it cancels out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is H.264 a better codec technically, yeah, ok, and Nokia and Apple are
</I>&gt;<i> free to support it if they wish in addition to Theora, or even to
</I>&gt;<i> implement all of the HTML5 spec except for Theora support and risk being
</I>&gt;<i> called out as non-conformant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The old wording was a SHOULD requirement. No MUST. If the big players
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; don't want to take the perceived risk (their decision) they'd still be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 100% within the spec. Thus I fail to see why there was need for action.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that if the big players don't follow the spec, even the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SHOULD requirements, then the spec is basically pointless. What we want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't that some people support Ogg, what we fundamentally want is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _everyone_ support the same codec, whatever that may be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then revert the text and make it a MUST.  As far as I know, there are no
</I>&gt;<i> other codecs out there that are not encumbered.  This is the whole
</I>&gt;<i> reason for existence of Theora, at least at the time, and I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> that this has changed in the few years since it was designed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want a baseline that everyone can implement without being
</I>&gt;<i> encumbered, then the answer is Theora.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Small companies aren't targetted by patent trolls. Only big (really big)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; companies are. It's a big-company concern, just like &quot;no per-user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensing&quot; is a small-company concern. That's just the reality of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation, it's not intended to be a bias.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except that it very clearly is biasing the decision making process so
</I>&gt;<i> far.  The language was changed because the big companies weren't
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable with it, moving in the direction of screwing the little guy.
</I>&gt;<i>  That is bias.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Well, the intentions certainly didn't match the actions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am sorry you perceive them this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As witnessed by the large influx of people on the list that you

</I>&gt;<i> similar opinions, perhaps you should reconsider whether this is merely a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you really want this to be a baseline codec that everyone can

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Fact: Vorbis is the *only* codec whose patent status has been widely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; researched, nearly to exhaustion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sadly there's really no such thing as an exhaustive patent search.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, but that there was an extensive attempt made make Vorbis and Theora
</I>&gt;<i> much safer than the alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Let me rephrase your statement to be worded in a more *honest* way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Vorbis provides the perfect escape for proprietary audio prisons.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Apple and Nokia are having problems with consumers and authors actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; waking up and using free, non-patent-encumbered, widely available,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; unrestricted, non-proprietary technology.  Since Vorbis directly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; threatens their ability to sell traps, they are extorting your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; compliance with threats of not supporting the HTML5 spec.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what you base your conclusions on, but I assure you that to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the best of my knowledge, that's not the current situation. I have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in this business a long time, and I've been played for a fool many times
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before. This particular issue does not have the tell-tale signs of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; players acting in bad faith. Indeed, Apple employees have probably done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more to resolve this issue than anyone else so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really?  And Nokia calling Ogg &quot;proprietary&quot; doesn't raise any red
</I>&gt;<i> flags?  (merely an example)  Perhaps you should take a vacation from
</I>&gt;<i> this, Ian, clearly your bovine excrement meter is broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; companies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You've created the bias in the premise.  By including the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;additional&quot;, there, you have artificially limited the field to codecs
</I>&gt;<i> which are already implemented by the large companies.  That is not
</I>&gt;<i> progress, that is one great big, huge, gigantic step backward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is untenable, and is a large part of the basis for the outrage from
</I>&gt;<i> the public that you're currently on the receiving end of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The whole point of the change was to make the point that we need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that will not screw you. Ogg isn't a solution, as it won't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented by Apple and Microsoft. If we require Ogg, then what will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen is the big players will support something else, then that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become the de-facto standard, and you will get screwed. What we _want_ is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for everyone to support the same codec. We don't get that by having a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SHOULD-level requirement for Ogg.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then make it a MUST-level requirement.  There is no other solution.  If
</I>&gt;<i> we give in to the big companies trying to screw us during the spec
</I>&gt;<i> design, then we're surely screwed, by design.  At least, if we make the
</I>&gt;<i> spec MUST-level for Theora, we can bring pressure to bear on Microsoft,
</I>&gt;<i> Apple, Nokia, and whoever else by shining a spotlight on their
</I>&gt;<i> non-conformance to the spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we change the spec to acceed to their need to screw the end users,
</I>&gt;<i> then the end users will, shockingly, be screwed for sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am not saying that ogg should be enforced onto anyone, if nokia wishes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to keep using a different format, no problem, but by making it a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; standard, we at least know that ogg will be supported by all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (standards-compatible) browsers, and as such it can be deployed by those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; who are opposed to vendor lock-in or monopoly positions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We know that all standards-compatible browsers will support the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standards, but what about all the other browsers? Surely what we want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't just for a small set of browsers to support a codec but for _all_
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the browsers to suppor the same codec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But since we're in a standards setting venue, non-standards-compliant
</I>&gt;<i> browsers (now or future) and, by definition out of scope.  There will
</I>&gt;<i> always be non-conformant implementations, we can't avoid that.  The spec
</I>&gt;<i> should hold true to the goals that the spec sets out to bring about.
</I>&gt;<i> One of those goals, from the w3c, is freedom and openness.  Theora is
</I>&gt;<i> the only realistic choice for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theora *is* the baseline for free and open video, full stop.  Everything
</I>&gt;<i> else reasonable is encumbered (at least to my knowledge).  Assuming I'm
</I>&gt;<i> right, discussion over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; OGG is the choice of freedom, enabling that freedom for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; webdevelopers is a must in my opinion, although in the same spirit, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can not be enforced upon anyone, therefor the original text stating it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;should&quot; instead of it &quot;must&quot; is probably the best way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Freedom for those who choose, the alternative for the rest.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ogg is _a_ choice, which provides freedom for some but not everyone. We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need a codec that works for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you might as well give up on HTML5 right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Maybe Nokia would be as good as to point out which codec is better? wmv?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; divx? mov?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sadly today there are no codecs that address all the needs of everyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; involved; if there was, we wouldn't be having this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is true, and I don't believe it is, then the HTML5 spec can
</I>&gt;<i> never have what you're looking for, a codec that everyone can and will
</I>&gt;<i> support.  Theora is as close as you're gonna get.  Make it part of the
</I>&gt;<i> spec, and I would say make it a MUST and yell loud and long at Apple,
</I>&gt;<i> MS, Nokia and others when they claim conformance to HTML5 and don't
</I>&gt;<i> implement it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; My argument in favour of a &quot;free&quot; codec is that all browsers could ship
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with it, without fear of being sued, this would allow users to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; watch/listen to clips/movies/music out of the box without scouring the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Internet for codec XYZ for a once off use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that's what everyone wants. The problem is that Ogg is not such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; codec -- Apple, for instance, can't implement Ogg without fear of being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sued.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pardon me, but the sanitized version just isn't strong enough, here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, let's hear what the real reason Apple doesn't want to
</I>&gt;<i> support this, because this reason doesn't pass the smell test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I assure you that the change was made in good faith; I (sadly) received
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no money for the change. I really wish I had.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you got played.  Congratulations.
