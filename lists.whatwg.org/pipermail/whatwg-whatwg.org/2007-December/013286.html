What was the consensus on the &quot;what to do&quot; question? I would be quite
interested to get c) undertaken and see how real the submarine patent
threats are. Is that a real possibility for the W3C to do (I mean:
financially speaking)?

Also, if there is any potential that large patent owners could make
statements about the applicability of their patents to these open
specifications, the let's try it!

Silvia.
