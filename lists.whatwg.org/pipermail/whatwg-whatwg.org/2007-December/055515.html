<PRE>Well, consensus is going to be hard to find, with the conflicts of interest at 
play here.  And all that we want is that Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora, being the 
ideal balance between least-encumbered and technically sufficient options, be 
mentioned in the document that will be read by millions -- even if it wasn't 
a SHOULD but a MAY or an ITWOULDBENICE.  They more than deserve it.

So, here's a challenge.  Does Apple really *only* want to be able to claim 
SHOULD conformance?  Reinstate the paragraph and put MAY instead of SHOULD, 
then go crazy authoring H.264 content for the VIDEO tag.  That resolution 
lets you have SHOULD conformance.  If you refuse, we know that it's a market 
and monopoly thing.  If you accept, we know you were being straightforward 
all along.
