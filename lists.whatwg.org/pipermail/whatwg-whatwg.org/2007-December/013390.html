Right, but of course neither VCEG nor ISO/IEC have a monopoly on setting
standards.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, AVC is a de-facto standard. Every iPod supports it. Every PSP
</I>&gt;<i> supports it. Every HD-DVD and Blu-Ray player supports it. The mobile
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystem has long since adopted MPEG-4, and most video services either
</I>&gt;<i> use AVC now or are on track to. Even Adobe, who&#8217;s had lots of success to
</I>&gt;<i> this point with proprietary formats, has finally adopted it a
</I>&gt;<i> replacement of VP6.
</I>
AVC *is* successful in its field. The Ogg codecs are successful in their
field (royality free codecs). Both are pretty &quot;standard&quot; depending on
what point of view one has.

&gt;<i> Comparing apples-to-apples, Ogg Theora isn&#8217;t a standard. It /was/ a
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary On2 video codec, and it didn&#8217;t become a standard just
</I>&gt;<i> because On2 gave everyone a royalty-free license, so you can see how
</I>&gt;<i> some people might still think of it as proprietary. The fact that it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> open-source isn&#8217;t relevant, since of course there are open-source
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of AVC as well.
</I>
It's a standard because it has a public spec and because an organization
issues those spec. A neutral non-profit organization I should say, which
may not mean much to a corporate environment but is adding to the
acceptance level in other environments.


&gt;<i> It was already old technology when On2
</I>&gt;<i> gave it away, so it&#8217;s MPEG-1-like inefficiency makes it retro (to put it
</I>&gt;<i> kindly) on the PC, and completely unsuitable for typicaly 3G mobile
</I>&gt;<i> throughput.
</I>
Putting the Theora bitstream into the same efficiency class as MPEG-1 is
pretty questionable and I'm inclined to say your statement is wrong. I
also doubt the &quot;completely unsuitable&quot; for 3G throughput statement as
you don't even give specific requirements. Having said that even H.264
can be considered &quot;old technology&quot;, albeit it *is* more sophisticated
than Theora, albeit I'd assume that e.g. on profiles used on mobile
phones it wouldn't even be able to take advantage of all of its coding
schemes.
