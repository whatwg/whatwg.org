<PRE>Allow me to be the voice of the small Web developer -- which I consider to be 
the foundation of the World Wide Web.

In reference to:
<A HREF="http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=1142&amp;to=1143">http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=1142&amp;to=1143</A>

The recent removal of the mention of Ogg in HTML5 and the subsequent 
replacement of its paragraph with the weasel-worded paragraph that would make 
Minitrue bust their collective shirt buttons in pride:

&lt;p class=&quot;big-issue&quot;&gt;It would be helpful for interoperability if all+  
browsers could support the same codecs. However, there are no known+  codecs 
that satisfy all the current players: we need a codec that is+  known to not 
require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is+  compatible with the 
open source development model, that is of+  sufficient quality as to be 
usable, and that is not an additional+  submarine patent risk for large 
companies. This is an ongoing issue+  and this section will be updated once 
more information is+  available.&lt;/p&gt;

is a preposterous and gross mischaracterization of fact (dare I say lie).  At 
the very least, it's FUD.

It pains me to state what is and has always been public knowledge, and is 
being intentionally ignored just to &quot;get the spec published&quot;:

- The Xiph developers were extremely zealous and almost fiduciarily diligent 
in researching all possible patent threats to Vorbis technology, and for more 
than a year they found none -- they even did the research *before* beginning 
to code, explicitly to avoid submarine patents.  I know, because I was 
subscribed to their mailing list and read status updates of this research, 
practically at the start of the project.  I also know that big-name software 
houses and media players manufacture products with Vorbis technology, and 
none of them have been sued.  It's been what, seven years now?
- The Theora codec has had its patents practically relinquished by On3 with a 
perpetual royalty-free license.
- Ogg and its audio/video codec technologies are the ONLY free software media 
technologies with implementations widely available on all consumer computing 
platforms -- from WM codecs to Linux DLLs, passing through the entire range 
of hardware (floating-point and fixed-point) and OSes.
- Without guaranteed Ogg support (whose integration in user agents I think I 
already established to be sort of a weekend-level junior programmer project 
at NO COST, due to the ready availability of the technology in all 
platforms), authors *will be* forced to use patent-encumbered technology.  
Remember MP3? Well, with HTML5 it's 1997 all over again.

Ian, revert.  This compromise on basic values is unacceptable, *whatever* the 
practical reasons you have deemed to compromise for.  If you don't revert, 
you will be giving us independent authors the shaft.  And we will remember it 
forever.
