&gt;<i> Is H.264 a better codec technically, yeah, ok, and Nokia and Apple are
</I>&gt;<i> free to support it if they wish in addition to Theora, or even to
</I>&gt;<i> implement all of the HTML5 spec except for Theora support and risk being
</I>&gt;<i> called out as non-conformant.
</I>
I do not think the upper management would even consider avoiding this
risk.  It is all trifles to them.  I can also imagine their claiming
conformance while they actually are not, and there is nothing the
wizards can do to stop the upper management of the customers from buying
that.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The old wording was a SHOULD requirement. No MUST. If the big players 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; don't want to take the perceived risk (their decision) they'd still be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 100% within the spec. Thus I fail to see why there was need for action.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that if the big players don't follow the spec, even the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SHOULD requirements, then the spec is basically pointless. What we want 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't that some people support Ogg, what we fundamentally want is that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _everyone_ support the same codec, whatever that may be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then revert the text and make it a MUST.  As far as I know, there are no
</I>&gt;<i> other codecs out there that are not encumbered.  This is the whole
</I>&gt;<i> reason for existence of Theora, at least at the time, and I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> that this has changed in the few years since it was designed.
</I>
That would make the whole HTML5 thing drift off to the ocean of
self-worship.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want a baseline that everyone can implement without being
</I>&gt;<i> encumbered, then the answer is Theora.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Small companies aren't targetted by patent trolls. Only big (really big) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; companies are. It's a big-company concern, just like &quot;no per-user 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensing&quot; is a small-company concern. That's just the reality of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation, it's not intended to be a bias.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except that it very clearly is biasing the decision making process so
</I>&gt;<i> far.  The language was changed because the big companies weren't
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable with it, moving in the direction of screwing the little guy.
</I>&gt;<i>  That is bias.
</I>
And the standard really has no means to stop them, whatever it says.  Do
you want a standard that says Microsoft is nonconformant?  It already
is, has always been, and no standard is going to change that because
they do not give a damn.

As Ian already pointed out, truth values do not add up.

</I>
Are you a Wiccan or something?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Fact: Vorbis is the *only* codec whose patent status has been widely 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; researched, nearly to exhaustion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sadly there's really no such thing as an exhaustive patent search.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, but that there was an extensive attempt made make Vorbis and Theora
</I>&gt;<i> much safer than the alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Let me rephrase your statement to be worded in a more *honest* way.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Vorbis provides the perfect escape for proprietary audio prisons.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Apple and Nokia are having problems with consumers and authors actually 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; waking up and using free, non-patent-encumbered, widely available, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; unrestricted, non-proprietary technology.  Since Vorbis directly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; threatens their ability to sell traps, they are extorting your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; compliance with threats of not supporting the HTML5 spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what you base your conclusions on, but I assure you that to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the best of my knowledge, that's not the current situation. I have been in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this business a long time, and I've been played for a fool many times 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before. This particular issue does not have the tell-tale signs of players 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acting in bad faith. Indeed, Apple employees have probably done more to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resolve this issue than anyone else so far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Really?  And Nokia calling Ogg &quot;proprietary&quot; doesn't raise any red
</I>&gt;<i> flags?  (merely an example)  Perhaps you should take a vacation from
</I>&gt;<i> this, Ian, clearly your bovine excrement meter is broken.
</I>
It does not matter whether Nokia is wrong or right, the only relevant
question is what they are going to do.  Perceive that as Gromyko talk.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; companies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You've created the bias in the premise.  By including the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;additional&quot;, there, you have artificially limited the field to codecs
</I>&gt;<i> which are already implemented by the large companies.  That is not
</I>&gt;<i> progress, that is one great big, huge, gigantic step backward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is untenable, and is a large part of the basis for the outrage from
</I>&gt;<i> the public that you're currently on the receiving end of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The whole point of the change was to make the point that we need something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that will not screw you. Ogg isn't a solution, as it won't be implemented 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by Apple and Microsoft. If we require Ogg, then what will happen is the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; big players will support something else, then that will become the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; de-facto standard, and you will get screwed. What we _want_ is for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone to support the same codec. We don't get that by having a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SHOULD-level requirement for Ogg.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then make it a MUST-level requirement.  There is no other solution.  If
</I>&gt;<i> we give in to the big companies trying to screw us during the spec
</I>&gt;<i> design, then we're surely screwed, by design.  At least, if we make the
</I>&gt;<i> spec MUST-level for Theora, we can bring pressure to bear on Microsoft,
</I>&gt;<i> Apple, Nokia, and whoever else by shining a spotlight on their
</I>&gt;<i> non-conformance to the spec.
</I>
The only arguments they respect is law and money, and the standard is
not a law.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we change the spec to acceed to their need to screw the end users,
</I>&gt;<i> then the end users will, shockingly, be screwed for sure.
</I>
Well, certainly, and the only thing you can do about that is to join the
Salvation Army.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am not saying that ogg should be enforced onto anyone, if nokia wishes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to keep using a different format, no problem, but by making it a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; standard, we at least know that ogg will be supported by all 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (standards-compatible) browsers, and as such it can be deployed by those 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; who are opposed to vendor lock-in or monopoly positions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We know that all standards-compatible browsers will support the standards, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but what about all the other browsers? Surely what we want isn't just for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a small set of browsers to support a codec but for _all_ the browsers to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suppor the same codec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But since we're in a standards setting venue, non-standards-compliant
</I>&gt;<i> browsers (now or future) and, by definition out of scope.  
</I>
&quot;A good king gives wise orders&quot; --- King.

&gt;<i> There will
</I>&gt;<i> always be non-conformant implementations, we can't avoid that.  The spec
</I>&gt;<i> should hold true to the goals that the spec sets out to bring about.
</I>&gt;<i> One of those goals, from the w3c, is freedom and openness.  Theora is
</I>&gt;<i> the only realistic choice for that.
</I>
And another one is universal acceptance.  Theora happens to be an
obstacle to that goal.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Theora *is* the baseline for free and open video, full stop.  Everything
</I>&gt;<i> else reasonable is encumbered (at least to my knowledge).  Assuming I'm
</I>&gt;<i> right, discussion over.
</I>
Happy to hear that, given that my inbox has 150 messages today.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; OGG is the choice of freedom, enabling that freedom for all 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; webdevelopers is a must in my opinion, although in the same spirit, it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can not be enforced upon anyone, therefor the original text stating it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;should&quot; instead of it &quot;must&quot; is probably the best way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Freedom for those who choose, the alternative for the rest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ogg is _a_ choice, which provides freedom for some but not everyone. We 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need a codec that works for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then you might as well give up on HTML5 right now.
</I>
Please, there are other interesting aspects of HTML than embedding video
content.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Maybe Nokia would be as good as to point out which codec is better? wmv? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; divx? mov?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sadly today there are no codecs that address all the needs of everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; involved; if there was, we wouldn't be having this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is true, and I don't believe it is, then the HTML5 spec can
</I>&gt;<i> never have what you're looking for, a codec that everyone can and will
</I>&gt;<i> support.  Theora is as close as you're gonna get.  Make it part of the
</I>&gt;<i> spec, and I would say make it a MUST and yell loud and long at Apple,
</I>&gt;<i> MS, Nokia and others when they claim conformance to HTML5 and don't
</I>&gt;<i> implement it.
</I>
And make a fool of yourself.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; My argument in favour of a &quot;free&quot; codec is that all browsers could ship 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with it, without fear of being sued, this would allow users to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; watch/listen to clips/movies/music out of the box without scouring the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Internet for codec XYZ for a once off use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that's what everyone wants. The problem is that Ogg is not such a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; codec -- Apple, for instance, can't implement Ogg without fear of being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sued.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pardon me, but the sanitized version just isn't strong enough, here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
</I>
Shoot the bull, shoot the bull, shoot the bull.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, let's hear what the real reason Apple doesn't want to
</I>&gt;<i> support this, because this reason doesn't pass the smell test.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I assure you that the change was made in good faith; I (sadly) received no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money for the change. I really wish I had.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then you got played.  Congratulations.
</I>&gt;<i>
