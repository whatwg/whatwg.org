Yes.

</I>&gt;<i> (which might be Ogg, or something else).  That's all.
</I>
The text was changed from a SHOULD implement Ogg et all to a completely
non-descriptive text.

If things are up in the air, then why change it?  Just leave the text
and have the discussion.  If a better solution is arrived at, *then*
change the text of the spec.  What need is there to change the current
draft of the spec away from ogg et all?  That indicates a move away from
ogg et al by this body, and you're surprised why people get up in arms?

Sorry, again, doesn't pass the smell test.

&gt;&gt;<i> Listen to what the people are saying.

&gt;<i> Oh, I am listening.  It's by no means clear that the Ogg crowd is at

</I>&gt;<i> count lamenting &quot;I want my ogg&quot; on this list as spending efforts at all.
</I>
Maybe you should listen to the meta-argument, then.

I'm sick and tired of getting screwed by big companies (including
Apple), and I will *not* quietly accept it.

If the text is changed to move away from a free and open solution to
something that is going to be encumbered, you better believe I'm going
to be up in arms about it, and I will not apologize for it.  This change
is exactly that sort of change.

I would much rather Apple not implement HTML5 at all, so I can call
Apple out on it in the marketplace, than to let an encumbered technology
be ensconced in a standard like HTML5.  And, in the past, these exact
sorts of maneuvering is exactly the sort of behavior that has led to big
companies getting end-user-screwing technologies ensconced into specs
and standards.
