<PRE>Also as Maciej said earlier, we at Apple did not ask that the SHOULD  
wording be removed and had stated we could live with it.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Fear of submarine patents is only one reason Apple is not

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there would be no reason to pick Theora over H.264.  Everyone  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wants an open freely implementable codec, but it doesn't follow  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that Theora should automatically be that codec.  About the only  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> argument I've heard in favor of Theora is that &quot;it's open&quot;, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that is an argument based purely on IP and not on technical merits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Openness is a prerequisite. Technical adequacy is a prerequisite.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The technically best solution is not a prerequisite. In case it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't obvious yet, an open, adequate format is preferred over a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better proprietary one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that is obvious at all, especially when the &lt;video&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> tag's chief competition, Flash, is using the technically superior  
</I>&gt;<i> solution.  Why would authors switch away from Flash if &lt;video&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't offer any technically compelling reason to switch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you consider mobile devices that want to browse the Web, then  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> depending on the constraints of the device, a hardware solution  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> may be required to view video with any kind of reasonable  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> performance.  A mandate of Theora is effectively dictating to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those mobile vendors that they have to create custom hardware that  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can play back Theora video.  Given that such devices may already  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need a hardware solution for existing video like H.264, it seems  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unreasonable for HTML5 to mandate what hardware a vendor has to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> develop just to browse Web video on a mobile device.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks. I wasn't previously convinced we needed to mandate *any*  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular format, but you just convinced me. If hardware is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support is required for some devices, then it does indeed sound  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like a good idea to mandate some minimum level of conformance. It  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is far better that this minimum level of conformance be an open,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freely implementable standard such as Ogg/Theora than a known  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patent encumbered format such as H.264.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good.  I also believe there should be a mandated baseline.  That's  
</I>&gt;<i> why I think SHOULD is too weak, and that we should be working  
</I>&gt;<i> towards a MUST.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or put another way, imagine that GIF was an open format but PNG  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was IP-encumbered.  Would you really want to limit the Web to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> displaying only GIFs just because it was the only open image  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> format available?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please stop attacking straw men. No one has suggested that. Under  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those circumstances, I absolutely would support requiring all  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsers to display GIFs. This would not prohibit them from also  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displaying PNGs if they chose to license the relevant patents.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but, continuing the analogy, the issue you run into is if the  
</I>&gt;<i> Web at large considers PNG to be superior and just ends up using it  
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, then specifying &quot;SHOULD use GIF&quot; is rather irrelevant.  I do  
</I>&gt;<i> not think people will switch to &lt;video&gt; using Theora when a  
</I>&gt;<i> technically superior alternative exists that will also work in  
</I>&gt;<i> Internet Explorer (Flash).  We have to make sure that &lt;video&gt; is on  
</I>&gt;<i> par technically with what Flash can do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Technical arguments are relevant here, so take some time to  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consider them before accusing people of having shady ulterior  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> motives.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Technical arguments are relevant, but do not control. They are  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neither the only nor the most important consideration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly an inadequate open standard should not be proposed as the  
</I>&gt;<i> only way forward simply by virtue of its openness.  Wanting an open  
</I>&gt;<i> standard does not mean that Theora should just be automatically  
</I>&gt;<i> chosen to be that open standard.  It is also a logical error to  
</I>&gt;<i> assume that openness is not desired by a vendor merely because one  
</I>&gt;<i> potential open format is not approved by that vendor.
