<PRE>Silvia,

By definition submarine patents are patents nobody knows of, except its
owners, who might just wait until a deep pocket company has shipped a
considerable amount of products before requesting this company to
compensate them for their IP they are using in this product. W3C has no
possibility to detect or even prodect from these patents. Pls see our
position paper of the W3C Video on the Web workshop.

The other issue that might have gotten less attention in recent mailing
list and Slashdot discussion is the availability of chipsets that
support a considered codec for desktop and embedded environments.
Silicon support is essential for battery-powered devices. A pure SW
implementation of a codec will be slower and will drain the battery way
faster than a codec that relies on HW accelleration.

But lets examine the outcome of the W3C workshop.

Cheers
- Guido
