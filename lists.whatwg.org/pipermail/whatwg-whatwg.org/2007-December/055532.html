You are clearly completely unaware of the extensive analysis done of 
other codecs, including those that are licensed.

This is getting marginally offensive.  Are you present at the patent 
reform discussions in DC?  Can you state categorically that we were 
not there, or give a precis of our opinion if we were there?  Come 
on, people.  The WhatWG is not going to solve the world-wide patent 
issues.  At least recognize your own limitations.

Cool.  Bring them on.  We might even *buy* patent insurance from 
them, who knows?  Money for jam, right?

Thanks for telling us our own situation and motivation.  I really needed that.

Fact:  we ship standard codecs and container formats.  I took an iPod 
video to a standards meeting 10 days after its introduction and had 
*5* other companies using their own implementations of MP4 file 
format, AAC, and H.264, make files for it that played.  I was and 
remain proud of that;  it demonstrates more than any email how 
committed we are to a multi-vendor, open, world.

We (whatwg) don't need pressure, as we have general consensus on what 
we desire;  we need work done to find an acceptable solution.
