<PRE>I'm sure that many people would be happy to see a mandate if someone 
were willing to offer an indemnity against risk here.  You seem quite 
convinced there is no risk;  are you willing to offer the indemnity?

Large companies (Nokia, Microsoft, and Apple) have expressed anxiety, 
and are asking (among other things) that an independent analysis be 
done.  The W3C staff are, I believe, actively working on the issue. 
I'm sure that they would be pleased to consider whatever background 
material you can offer them.

I fail to see how asking for an analysis of the problem is giving 
anyone &quot;the shaft&quot;, since no decision has yet been even offered let 
alone reached.

Did you read the piece that I edited from the discussions at the HTML meeting?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>- The Xiph developers were extremely zealous and almost fiduciarily diligent
</I>&gt;<i>in researching all possible patent threats to Vorbis technology, and for more
</I>&gt;<i>than a year they found none -- they even did the research *before* beginning
</I>&gt;<i>to code, explicitly to avoid submarine patents.  I know, because I was
</I>&gt;<i>subscribed to their mailing list and read status updates of this research,
</I>&gt;<i>practically at the start of the project.  I also know that big-name software
</I>&gt;<i>houses and media players manufacture products with Vorbis technology, and
</I>&gt;<i>none of them have been sued.  It's been what, seven years now?
</I>&gt;<i>- The Theora codec has had its patents practically relinquished by On3 with a
</I>&gt;<i>perpetual royalty-free license.
</I>&gt;<i>- Ogg and its audio/video codec technologies are the ONLY free software media
</I>&gt;<i>technologies with implementations widely available on all consumer computing
</I>&gt;<i>platforms -- from WM codecs to Linux DLLs, passing through the entire range
</I>&gt;<i>of hardware (floating-point and fixed-point) and OSes.
</I>&gt;<i>- Without guaranteed Ogg support (whose integration in user agents I think I
</I>&gt;<i>already established to be sort of a weekend-level junior programmer project
</I>&gt;<i>at NO COST, due to the ready availability of the technology in all
</I>&gt;<i>platforms), authors *will be* forced to use patent-encumbered technology. 
</I>&gt;<i>Remember MP3? Well, with HTML5 it's 1997 all over again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ian, revert.  This compromise on basic values is unacceptable, *whatever* the
</I>&gt;<i>practical reasons you have deemed to compromise for.  If you don't revert,
</I>&gt;<i>you will be giving us independent authors the shaft.  And we will remember it
