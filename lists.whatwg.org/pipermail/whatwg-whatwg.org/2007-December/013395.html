Noted.

&gt;<i> In my experience, an organization (non-profit or not) can't simply publish their own specification and claim, &quot;hey, this is a standard&quot;.
</I>
MPEG essentially does just that ;)

Any group of individuals and/or organizations that is negotiating on one
common spec may be considered to be an organization issuing standards.

If every party on world shall be supposed to accept any spec as
&quot;standard&quot; just because some group says so is of course a completely
different matter.

I think it all depends on definition and interpretation. If MPEG is an
organization issuing &quot;real&quot; standards and Xiph is not... can e.g. WHATWG
be considered to be issuing a &quot;real&quot; standard? Can individual companies
issue standards? Is there a standard for creating standards?

Anyway, I think your point is that Xiph.org most likely isn't considered
to be an &quot;established&quot; standard-issuing group by all parties.


&gt;&gt;<i> Putting the Theora bitstream into the same efficiency class as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MPEG-1 is pretty questionable...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're right, that was based on my experience with VC3.  It's possible that Theora is a bit more efficient, although any significant efficiency improvements versus the VC3 base would also increase the &quot;surface area&quot; at risk to infringement.
</I>
It's extending on &quot;low hanging fruits&quot;. The most noticable change would
be that Theora streams carry parameters which were hard-coded in VP3,
which isn't a new concept.

Note that the VP3 encoder, which Theora did inherit, is/was pretty buggy
and isn't doing good decisions in a lot of cases. This is being worked
on and getting the encoder into a much better shape is what'll bring the
reference encoder to a 1.0 version level.

&gt;<i> This is getting uncomfortably off-topic, but a reasonable real-world target is 300 Kbps for both audio and video, maybe less if you want it increase the chances of it working around rush hour.
</I>
Okay, this is more or less what can be seen in action on e.g. Youtube
(256 kbit/s H.263 with 64 kbit/s MP3). Good encoders for pre-H.264
formats can provide a working solution (and to my knowledge Youtube
isn't even using the most sophisticated H.263 encoder available). Theora
can do this, no doubt.
