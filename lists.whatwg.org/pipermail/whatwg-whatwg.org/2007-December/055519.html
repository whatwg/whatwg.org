<PRE>&gt;<i> A decision was made to have the text reflect the facts that (a)
</I>&gt;<i> no-one is happy with a 'should' and (b) that work is ongoing to find
</I>&gt;<i> a solution (which might be Ogg, or something else).  That's all.
</I>
I may not be a W3C chair, but I'm pretty sure that if I disagree, then 
using &quot;no-one&quot; in your sentence is a lie.  And I'm not the only one.

&gt;<i> &gt;Listen to what the people are saying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I am listening.  It's by no means clear that the Ogg crowd is at
</I>&gt;<i> all.  I'm also spending efforts working on finding a solution.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't count lamenting &quot;I want my ogg&quot; on this list as spending
</I>&gt;<i> efforts at all.
</I>
That's because you already found your solution: H.264.  Except that it's not 
an option.  Face it, &quot;spending efforts on finding a solution&quot; is a red 
herring, because if any codec was both good and patent-unencumbered (besides 
the Ogg technology family, of course):

- you'd already heard about it
- you could still wave your hands and say &quot;nooooooo, it might be torpedoed by 
a submarine patent&quot;

It's just stalling.
