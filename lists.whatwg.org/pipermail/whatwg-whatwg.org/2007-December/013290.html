<PRE>&gt;<i> We have to take into accounts the needs of everyone. This includes large 
</I>&gt;<i> companies. If large companies will only accept codecs that they've already 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, then that may have to be one of the criteria.
</I>
This conflicts with:

&gt;<i> Whatever solution we find will be one that is royalty free and open. That 
</I>&gt;<i> is not in any doubt.
</I>
You can't have it both ways. 

&gt;<i> If the text moves to requiring a non-free codec, then you will have been 
</I>&gt;<i> screwed, and then you should raise almightly hell. However, no such 
</I>&gt;<i> decision has been made (and no such decision will ever be made, at least 
</I>&gt;<i> not while I'm involved).
</I>
Pfew, can we get a signed copy of that? :P

&gt;<i> * We could convince the MPEG-LA group to provide a royalty free license 
</I>&gt;<i>   for one of their codecs, e.g. H.264 Baseline.
</I>
Very unlikely.

&gt;<i> * We could wait for Ogg to be used by a large fraction of the Web 
</I>&gt;<i>   population, as that would provide the business reason for companies 
</I>&gt;<i>   like Apple to support Ogg.
</I>
Without the standard? Highly doubtful.

&gt;<i> * We could use an codec old enough that all patents claimed to 
</I>&gt;<i>   be essential to its implementation have expired.
</I>
Highly useless. Bandwidth &amp; quality are still end user concerns.

The way i see it there are 3 possibilities so far:
- use ogg, possible (but negligable) risk of submarine patents
- use extremely old technology
- use another free codec which has a 100% guarantee that there are no patentholders lurking
	this does not exist (afaik)

At the end of the day, I think little choice remains except ogg.
