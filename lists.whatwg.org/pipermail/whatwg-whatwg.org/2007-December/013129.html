I am copying Geoff's reply here, in its entirety, without added  
commentary*, to stress how much I agree with every point he makes.

To take this point and expand it...

We're calling this &quot;local storage&quot; when in reality it is &quot;client side  
storage&quot; - this means the data belongs to the client machine's  
environment and not the server's environment.  The form the storage  
takes client-side is entirely up to the user agent and the client.   
Making any assumptions beyond &quot;this data belongs to and is managed by  
the client machine's environment&quot; is beyond the privilege of the web  
developer or server administrator.

apologies :)
