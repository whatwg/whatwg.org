We could, if one of the codecs that was implemented by large companies 
(e.g. H.264 Baseline) was made available royalty-free.

It could also be the case that the aforementioned large companies will 
accept a compromise that doesn't involve a codec they already implement.

Currently there is no known solution. That's why we're in this mess. But, 
as they say, top people are working on this.


&gt;<i> &gt; If the text moves to requiring a non-free codec, then you will have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been screwed, and then you should raise almightly hell. However, no

It's already in the spec:

# [...] we need a codec that is known to not require per-unit or 
# per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the open source 
# development model [...]


&gt;<i> The way i see it there are 3 possibilities so far:
</I>&gt;<i> - use ogg, possible (but negligable) risk of submarine patents
</I>
This is basically as acceptable to companies like Apple as H.264 is to the 
free software community.


&gt;<i> - use extremely old technology
</I>
Unfortunately this is unlikely to give us the quality we desire, but it is 
possible that we will have to compromise on this option.


&gt;<i> - use another free codec which has a 100% guarantee that there are no
</I>&gt;<i> patentholders lurking
</I>&gt;<i> 	this does not exist (afaik)
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> At the end of the day, I think little choice remains except ogg.
</I>
Ogg isn't a choice, unfortunately. I agree that little choice remains, 
though. But this is an open issue, and experts in the field are actively 
trying to resolve it to everyone's satisfaction.
