This is a tired argument already debunked. The browsers that won't 
support OGG support plugins (and still remain HTML5 compliant). The 
recommendation will push other browsers (of which there are many) 
towards a common ground.

&gt;<i> As stated before, it did not advocate them, merely stated them as *examples*
</I>&gt;<i> of image formats. Your claim that HTML4 played a substantial role in
</I>&gt;<i> adoption of GIF and JPEG is interesting. Do you have any sources for that?

(<A HREF="http://www.houseofmabel.com/programs/html3/docs/img.html">http://www.houseofmabel.com/programs/html3/docs/img.html</A>). I quote:
--------
As &quot;progress&quot; increases the number of graphics types I've been asked to 
support in /HTML3/, many people are unsure as to exactly what formats 
are supported so perhaps a list is in order:

    * GIF (&amp;695, &quot;GIF&quot;)
    * PNG (&amp;B60, &quot;PNG&quot;)
    * JPEG (&amp;C85, &quot;JPEG&quot;)
    * Sprite (&amp;FF9, &quot;Sprite&quot;)
    * BMP (&amp;69C, &quot;BMP&quot;)
    * SWF (&amp;188, &quot;Flash&quot;)
    * WBMP (&amp;F8F, &quot;WBMP&quot;)

-----------
So which of the above became defacto web standards under HTML4? And 
there were a LOT more image formats out there. Not proof, but certainly 
evidence the spec helped narrow down the list. Even though it was 
neither a SHOULD or MUST specification they were mentioned and it seems 
to me that counts for something. So did the fact the formats in question 
were believed to be public-domain. However, I acknowledge the 
speculative nature of this as I acknowledge the speculative nature of 
your other claims (like browser manufactures not supporting OGG when the 
spec becomes final).
