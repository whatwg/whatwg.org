<PRE>Agreed.  Let's just return the text, put a MUST in place of the SHOULD, and 
continue the discussion.  If you find your solution within one year, great, 
s/Ogg/Yoursolution/g.  If not, bite the bullet and go ahead.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  This entire discussion is founded on a major misapprehension:  that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  there has been a decision, and that decision was to exclude.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  simply not true;  there is no decision either to include or exclude.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  There is a recognition that work is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  I and others have spent a great deal of time on this problem already,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  working with a number of people, including the W3C staff.  Many of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; us --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  maybe all of us -- agree we need to find a solution that enables broad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  interoperability and is in accord with w3c and web practices. We have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;  not yet reached consensus on having found it.  That's all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A decision was made to move away from using the ogg family of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; technologies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A decision was made to have the text reflect the facts that (a) no-one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is happy with a 'should' and (b) that work is ongoing to find a solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which might be Ogg, or something else).  That's all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The text was changed from a SHOULD implement Ogg et all to a completely
</I>&gt;<i> non-descriptive text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If things are up in the air, then why change it?  Just leave the text
</I>&gt;<i> and have the discussion.  If a better solution is arrived at, *then*
</I>&gt;<i> change the text of the spec.  What need is there to change the current
</I>&gt;<i> draft of the spec away from ogg et all?  That indicates a move away from
</I>&gt;<i> ogg et al by this body, and you're surprised why people get up in arms?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, again, doesn't pass the smell test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; While not a final decision, it is a threatening decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to those of us that value freedom and openness and don't appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; being screwed by big companies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Listen to what the people are saying.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, I am listening.  It's by no means clear that the Ogg crowd is at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all.  I'm also spending efforts working on finding a solution.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; count lamenting &quot;I want my ogg&quot; on this list as spending efforts at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you should listen to the meta-argument, then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sick and tired of getting screwed by big companies (including
</I>&gt;<i> Apple), and I will *not* quietly accept it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the text is changed to move away from a free and open solution to
</I>&gt;<i> something that is going to be encumbered, you better believe I'm going
</I>&gt;<i> to be up in arms about it, and I will not apologize for it.  This change
</I>&gt;<i> is exactly that sort of change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would much rather Apple not implement HTML5 at all, so I can call
</I>&gt;<i> Apple out on it in the marketplace, than to let an encumbered technology
</I>&gt;<i> be ensconced in a standard like HTML5.  And, in the past, these exact
</I>&gt;<i> sorts of maneuvering is exactly the sort of behavior that has led to big
</I>&gt;<i> companies getting end-user-screwing technologies ensconced into specs
</I>&gt;<i> and standards.
