<PRE>I actually think this Slashdot comment summarizes the sentiment perfectly:

&quot;Methinks you are being a bit myopic here. Where would we be today if the HTML 
spec didn't specify jpg, gif, and png as baseline standards for the image 
tag? Can you imagine a huge mishmash of competing proprietary image 
standards, many of which wouldn't even render in free software browsers like 
Firefox? That would be a nightmare, but unfortunately, that's what's 
currently happening with video. Much like the image standard in HTML means 
that any browser can display anything in an image tag, so too must the video 
standard in HTML guarantee that any browser can display anything in a video 
tag. That's what the proposed specification is about.&quot;

Exactly.  For audio, Ogg Vorbis should be the baseline standard.  Companies 
are free to implement their own technology and installable kits or 
redistribution agreements that allow people to use their tech on their 
computers.  And for video, likewise but replace Vorbis for Theora.

Otherwise, let's start preparing for 1995 and &quot;To view this page, you need to 
install this piece of crapware&quot; all over again.  I lived that (together with 
Windows 95, which in all fairness was rather good compared to the 
alternatives -- thank god for Linux).  I don't want to experience it all over 
again, especially since I know that even today, that crapware isn't even 
gonna be made for Linux, and I'm going to be screwed again.

Ian, revert.

I was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I didn't 
know.
