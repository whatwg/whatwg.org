<PRE>&gt;<i> It was intended as meaning &quot;recognized&quot; in the sense of browsers
</I>&gt;<i> recognising them. No currently shipping browser recognises either Ogg
</I>&gt;<i> Vorbis or FLAC.
</I>
If I use EMBED on Konqueror pointing to an Ogg Vorbis file, I get a nice 
player with streaming and everything.  Konqueror's shipping, isn't it?

There is at least *one* browser that already supports, through GStreamer, Ogg 
in &lt;video&gt; tags.  I'd give you the link but it apparently fell off the end of 
Planet GNOME so I can't find it...  Now hold on, it's not shipping, but that 
doesn't mean it won't be shipping tomorrow.

What you actually wanted to say (but couldn't/didn't/were unwilling to) is:

&quot;No currently shipping browser by any of the major proprietary software 
vendors support Ogg Vorbis or FLAC&quot;.

And the reason they don't support it is because they have colluded against Ogg 
Vorbis or FLAC because they free consumers from proprietary prisons -- a 
development that is bad news for monopoly rent-seekers.  It's not just that 
proprietary browser vendors don't give a rat's arse about Ogg technology -- 
on the contrary, they're actively undermining it, as evidenced by this 
outrageous act of seemingly-neutral (but in reality 
pro-proprietary) &quot;editing&quot; of the spec.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's just dollars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apple does not license Apple Lossless to anyone else AFAIK,
</I>
OK.  So they sell fewer iPods because iPods don't play Ogg Vorbis without 
Rockbox.  Same outcome.

&gt;<i> and the 
</I>&gt;<i> only standards that MPEG-LA collects money for that Apple receives any
</I>&gt;<i> share of whatsoever is &quot;MPEG-4 Systems&quot; and IEEE 1394 (Firewire).
</I>&gt;<i> Neither of these have anything to do with audio/video codecs. Saying
</I>&gt;<i> that Apple has a financial interest in wanting MPEG codecs mandated in
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 5 is totally untrue.
</I>
I didn't say Apple wanted MPEG codecs mandated in HTML 5, so don't put words 
in my mouth or attempt to smoke-and-mirrors us with straw men.  This is 
either a fumble on your part or an attempt to derail the discussion into 
wreckland.

I said Apple doesn't want Ogg Vorbis because they don't control the tech, and 
because they would very much rather have consumers &quot;prefer&quot; (in the sense of 
being screwed with no choice) DRM-encumbered AAC (note it's not the codec, 
but the controlling of the consumer that matters here).
