&gt;<i> Ian, thank you for your answers re: video codecs. I agree with you now 
</I>&gt;<i> that everything that needs to said has been said regarding the change 
</I>&gt;<i> itself and I think most parties have made it clear how they feel and 
</I>&gt;<i> what they hope will resolve it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's clear the opinions of all parties cannot be reconciled. The current 
</I>&gt;<i> text has not reconciled the views, nor did the previous, nor can a 
</I>&gt;<i> future one. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this will not 
</I>&gt;<i> end well. I am quite certain the issue at stake here cannot be solved at 
</I>&gt;<i> the technical or legal level at all. This is truly a political/financial 
</I>&gt;<i> matter. Which brings us to the hard questions at the crux of the matter:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) When a browser vendor acts clearly outside of the public interest in 
</I>&gt;<i> the making of a public standard should that vendors desires still be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered relevant to the specification?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> 2.) When an issue is divided between a vendor (or group of) and 'the 
</I>&gt;<i> public' (or part of), what relative weight can be assigned to each?
</I>
Zarro.  The decisions should be based on consideration, not on voting.

&gt;<i> 3.) When a vendor makes false or misleading statements to guide an 
</I>&gt;<i> outcome should there be a form of 'censure' that does not involve a 
</I>&gt;<i> public flame war?
</I>
False statements and misleading statements are subject to criminal
penalties and civil litigation.

&gt;<i> 4.) If the purpose of the group is to build interoperability should a 
</I>&gt;<i> vendor be 'censured' for holding interoperability to ransom without 
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient technical or legal grounds?
</I>
No.  The group should invent a way out.

&gt;<i> 5.) What methods exists to define a disruptive member and remove them 
</I>&gt;<i> from further consideration?
</I>
I assume that there should be some policy everyone has to accept before
joining the group.

&gt;<i> 6.) Should a standards body make a ruling even though some members claim 
</I>&gt;<i> they won't obey it?
</I>
It depends on the ruling.

&gt;<i> 7.) Should a standards body bow to entrenched interests to keep the peace?
</I>
No.  Thou shalt not bow except to thy Lawd.

&gt;<i> 8.) Does the WHATWG consider itself to be a formal standards body?
</I>
I am not in position to answer that question but I would be surprised if
it did.

&gt;<i> 9.) Should HTML5 be put back under direct control of the w3c now that 
</I>&gt;<i> they have expressed interest in developing it?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> 10.) Is is appropriate for members to have discussions outside of this 
</I>&gt;<i> list, via IM, IRC or physical means not available or practical to the 
</I>&gt;<i> public?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> 11.) Does the group consider HTML5 to be a 'public standard' or a 
</I>&gt;<i> 'gentlemen's agreement' between vendors?
</I>
Actually, a public specification.

&gt;<i> 12.) Is it even legal for the majority of commercial browsers to form 
</I>&gt;<i> any agreement that could (directly or indirectly) result in higher costs 
</I>&gt;<i> for end-users? How do you prevent a 'working group' from becoming a cartel?
</I>
Yes, it is.  Only a government can prevent a formation of a cartel and
only a court can dismantle one.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are not questions that anybody can easily answer. Some have 
</I>&gt;<i> probably been answered in this list but not, at least to my reading of 
</I>&gt;<i> it, in the charter, the wiki or the FAQ (none appear legally binding in 
</I>&gt;<i> any case). It is possible the lack of clear answers in an obvious place 
</I>&gt;<i> may threaten the impartiality and purpose of this group, damage your 
</I>&gt;<i> public image and inflame debate. I believe the reason for much of the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'heat' over the video codec is due to all parties (including 
</I>&gt;<i> non-members) coming up with their own answers in the absence of a formal 
</I>&gt;<i> position. That and a lot of mistrust regarding members corporate priorities.
</I>
It is very good that all parties try to present their answers.  That is
what the group is for.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've read the charter but it doesn't define many rules. The w3c has 
</I>&gt;<i> rules but my understanding is that WHATWG is not a formal part of w3c 
</I>&gt;<i> (even if some members are).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Public acceptance of the standard may not, in practical terms, be as 
</I>&gt;<i> important as vendor acceptance (to vendors at least) but since the 
</I>&gt;<i> public is, in many ways, doing much of the vendors work for them it 
</I>&gt;<i> would beneficial to have a clearer statement of how these contributions 
</I>&gt;<i> are weighed. To cite a theoretical example: if some altruistic 
</I>&gt;<i> billionaire was to write the 'missing codec' that exceeded h.264 in 
</I>&gt;<i> compression, used 64k of ram, ran on a 386 using 50 lines of code and he 
</I>
The number of lines of code is irrelevant here.

&gt;<i> or she paid off all the trolls and indemnified vendors - what actions, 
</I>&gt;<i> if any, would WHATWG members take to ensure it was accepted by members 
</I>&gt;<i> with vested interests?
</I>
That is, by themselves?  There is hardly any need to answer that, it is
their business, not ours.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If that last theoretical question cannot be answered then what hope have 
</I>&gt;<i> we for a baseline video format?
</I>
We hope that the issue will be resolved in due course.

Chris
