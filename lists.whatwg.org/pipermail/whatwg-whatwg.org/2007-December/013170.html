Please, anybody, tell me it's not true.Ogg Vorbis/Theora is perfect for web applications. We need to suport those. Is there anybody else than me that realise it cost 0.75$ US to of patents licensing LEGALLY have an MP3 decoder? I devellop for embedded applications, and it cost 15000$ Just to ship around 100 Units with a MP3 software Encoder. Ogg and Theora does a comparable cost but are free. I still can't imagine why anybody would retract those two great standarts from HTML5, unless they have codecs they what royalties from!)-Jerome Marchand========================From: Manuel Amador

Subject: Removal off Ogg technology: *preposterous*

Allow me to be the voice of the small Web developer -- which I consider to be
the foundation of the World Wide Web.

In reference to:
<A HREF="http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=1142&amp;to=1143">http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=1142&amp;to=1143</A>

The recent removal of the mention of Ogg in HTML5 and the subsequent
replacement of its paragraph with the weasel-worded paragraph that would make
Minitrue bust their collective shirt buttons in pride:

&lt;p class=&#8221;big-issue&#8221;&gt;It would be helpful for interoperability if all+
browsers could support the same codecs. However, there are no known+  codecs
that satisfy all the current players: we need a codec that is+  known to not
require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is+  compatible with the
open source development model, that is of+  sufficient quality as to be
usable, and that is not an additional+  submarine patent risk for large
companies. This is an ongoing issue+  and this section will be updated once
more information is+  available.&lt;/p&gt;

is a preposterous and gross mischaracterization of fact (dare I say lie).
At the very least, it&#8217;s FUD.

It pains me to state what is and has always been public knowledge, and is
being intentionally ignored just to &#8220;get the spec published&#8221;:

- The Xiph developers were extremely zealous and almost fiduciarily diligent
in researching all possible patent threats to Vorbis technology, and for more
than a year they found none &#8212; they even did the research *before* beginning
to code, explicitly to avoid submarine patents.  I know, because I was
subscribed to their mailing list and read status updates of this research,
practically at the start of the project.  I also know that big-name software
houses and media players manufacture products with Vorbis technology,
and none of them have been sued.  It&#8217;s been what, seven years now?
- The Theora codec has had its patents practically relinquished by On3 with a
perpetual royalty-free license.
- Ogg and its audio/video codec technologies are the ONLY free software media
technologies with implementations widely available on all consumer computing
platforms &#8212; from WM codecs to Linux DLLs, passing through the entire range
of hardware (floating-point and fixed-point) and OSes.
- Without guaranteed Ogg support (whose integration in user agents I think I
already established to be sort of a weekend-level junior programmer project
at NO COST, due to the ready availability of the technology in all
platforms), authors *will be* forced to use patent-encumbered technology.
Remember MP3? Well, with HTML5 it&#8217;s 1997 all over again.

Ian, revert.  This compromise on basic values is unacceptable, *whatever* the
practical reasons you have deemed to compromise for.  If you don&#8217;t revert,
you will be giving us independent authors the shaft.  And we will remember it
forever.
