<PRE>Hi Guido,

The point of a patent research is to reduce the risk. Since companies
seem to be afraid there may be submarine patents and thus Theora
expresses a large risk for companies to support it, the way to reduce
the perceived risk is to do an independent analysis of the technology
incorporated in Theora about patents that it may be infringing. This
could be funded through all the interested parties together, including
open source/standards organisations like Mozilla or Xiph, but must be
undertaken by an independent organisation. The W3C is the right
organisation IMHO.

As for the mobile argument - Theora has been demonstrated to work on
chips using HW acceleration, so I cannot really see a problem with
that.

Regards,
Silvia.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Possible action:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The members of the WG are engineers, not IPR experts. There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; consensus that a solution is desirable, but also that engineers are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not well placed to find it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a) they are not experts in the IPR and licensing field;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; b) many of them are discouraged by their employers from reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; patents or discussing IPR.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's clear that the December workshop cannot be silent on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; subject.  There must be recognition of the issue and evidence of at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; least efforts to solve it, and preferably signs of progress.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It is probable that this is best handled in parallel with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; technical work, and headed by someone 'technically neutral' and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; qualified, such as W3C technical and legal staff.  A good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;start would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a) examine the declaration, licensing, and patent expiry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;situation for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; various codecs;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; b) contact the licensing authorities for various codecs to determine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their level of interest and flexibility, and possibly invite them to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the December workshop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; c) analyze the open-source codecs for their risk level, and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; seek statements from patent owners if that is deemed prudent;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What was the consensus on the &quot;what to do&quot; question? I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;be quite interested to get c) undertaken and see how real the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;submarine patent threats are. Is that a real possibility for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the W3C to do (I mean:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;financially speaking)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Also, if there is any potential that large patent owners could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;make statements about the applicability of their patents to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;these open specifications, the let's try it!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Silvia.
