No.

A decision was made to have the text reflect the facts that (a) 
no-one is happy with a 'should' and (b) that work is ongoing to find 
a solution (which might be Ogg, or something else).  That's all.

&gt;<i>While not a final decision, it is a threatening decision

&gt;<i>

</I>
Oh, I am listening.  It's by no means clear that the Ogg crowd is at 
all.  I'm also spending efforts working on finding a solution.  I 
don't count lamenting &quot;I want my ogg&quot; on this list as spending 
efforts at all.
