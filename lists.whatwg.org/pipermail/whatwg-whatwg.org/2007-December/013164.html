If keeping the web free of IP licensing horrors and being interoperable 
with as many players as possible (commercial and non-commercial 
entities, open source or not, free software or not) isn't much of a 
reason things are looking cheerless for the web indeed.

I don't exactly see why the web should embrace non-free standards just 
because the big players made the &quot;mistake&quot; of licensing 
definitely-encumbered formats and are unwilling to &quot;take further risks&quot;. 
(I am aware this is a pretty hard wording and that things aren't quite 
that easy.)

The old wording was a SHOULD requirement. No MUST. If the big players 
don't want to take the perceived risk (their decision) they'd still be 
100% within the spec. Thus I fail to see why there was need for action.

&gt;<i> One way to get a company like Apple to want to take the risk of 
</I>&gt;<i> implementing Theora would be to cause there to be a large pool of existing 
</I>&gt;<i> Theora content out there. Obviously, this presents a bootstrapping problem 
</I>&gt;<i> (aka a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem).
</I>
In a world where content is served on a per-user basis (streaming, DRM 
encrypted media files) I don't think this is much of an argument. HTML5 
is a future standard which will serve future content.

&gt;<i> I think the current wording in the spec is actually biased towards the 
</I>&gt;<i> small players more than the big ones, but if you think it's the other way 
</I>&gt;<i> around then I probably have struck the right balance.
</I>
I was specifically thinking of the &quot;additional submarine patent risk for 
large companies&quot; part. Nobody wants to get struck by a submarine, so 
either this requirement should be extended to all sort of entities or 
dropped completely (as its hard by definition to make an informed 
statement about submarine patents).
