Fine, let's leave it at that. We've both made our point.

&gt;<i> &gt; As stated before, it did not advocate them, merely stated them as
</I>*examples*
&gt;<i> &gt; of image formats. Your claim that HTML4 played a substantial role in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adoption of GIF and JPEG is interesting. Do you have any sources for
</I>that?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.houseofmabel.com/programs/html3/docs/img.html">http://www.houseofmabel.com/programs/html3/docs/img.html</A>). I quote:
</I>&gt;<i>    [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> So which of the above became defacto web standards under HTML4? And there
</I>were 
&gt;<i> a LOT more image formats out there. Not proof, but certainly evidence the
</I>spec 
&gt;<i> helped narrow down the list. 
</I>&gt;<i> Even though it was neither a SHOULD or MUST 
</I>&gt;<i> specification they were mentioned and it seems to me that counts for
</I>something. 
&gt;<i> So did the fact the formats in question were believed to be public-domain.
</I>
I don't really understand this. The page you are linking to seems to be
about a
relatively obscure HTML tool called HTML&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (forgive me), what does
the
list of image formats it supports show about the influence of the HTML4 spec
regarding this? 

&gt;<i> However, I acknowledge the speculative nature of this as I acknowledge the
</I>
&gt;<i> speculative nature of your other claims (like browser manufactures not
</I>supporting 
&gt;<i> OGG when the spec becomes final).
</I>
...Aren't those &quot;claims&quot; what the whole debate started with? 

Regards,

Stijn
