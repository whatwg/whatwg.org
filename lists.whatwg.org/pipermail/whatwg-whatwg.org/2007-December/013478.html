It's not a logical paradox.

You're assuming that the /only/ reason why vendors would implement a 
free codec is because the HTML5 specification says they SHOULD.

You're ignoring the possibility that before 2012, the same vendors 
implement a free codec anyway. They might have various reasons for doing 
so, for example:

a) Someone might invent free codecs that outperform other codecs.

b) Management might decide that adopting free codecs would be good for 
the web and their business, and take on the legal risk anyhow.

c) They might need to implement free codecs to prevent users start 
switching to other vendors' offerings because they support free codecs. 
This, I think, is what Ian means by &quot;compelling content&quot;: not content he 
(or we) find interesting or significant (like Wikipedia videos), but 
content that drives users en masse to rival browsers (and, in Apple's 
and Nokia's case, rival phones).

If vendors vulnerable to patent trolls did implement free codecs, then 
following WHATWG's recommendation would not involve additional submarine 
patent risks and both requirements would be met.

NB I call this a &quot;possibility&quot; not a &quot;probability&quot;.
