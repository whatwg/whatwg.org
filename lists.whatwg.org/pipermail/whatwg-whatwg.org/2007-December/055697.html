Your suggestions are impractical and you are smart enough to know that. 
You claim neutrality but YOU removed the Ogg recommendation and you 
haven't answered the IMPORTANT questions. I'll re-state:

1.) Does not implementing a SHOULD recommendation make a browser 
non-complaint (as far as validation goes)?
2.) What companies (if any) would abandon HTML5 based on a SHOULD 
recommendation?
3.) What is Google/Youtubes' official position (as the largest internet 
video provider)? I assume they are reading this list and I'm guessing 
you still work for them.
4.) What prevents a third party plugin open-source from providing Ogg 
support on Safari and Nokia browsers?
5.) Why are we waiting for ALL parties to agree when we all know they 
won't? Why can't the majority have their way in the absence of 100% 
agreement?
6.) How much compelling content is required before the draft is 
reverted. Does Wikipeadia count as compelling?


Answering these questions is the way forward, not back-and-forthing over 
legal issues.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Nokia certainly seem to be suggesting this, and they helped start this 
debate.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The ONLY issue here is about the inclusion of Ogg as a SUGGESTION (not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirement) and the ONLY argument against the format is that it *might* 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be subject to submarine patents - however since this applies to EVERY 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> video codec and even HTML5 itself it is also irrelevant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the issue is about finding a codec that everyone will implement. To 
</I>&gt;<i> that end, Theora is not an option, since we have clear statements from 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple vendors that they will not implement Theora.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, as I noted in this e-mail:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would please like to ask everyone participating in this discussion to 
</I>&gt;<i> focus on the future and on how we can move forward.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I am focusing on the future. I do not want Flash to become the defacto 
video standard. Inaction is still an action in this case.
