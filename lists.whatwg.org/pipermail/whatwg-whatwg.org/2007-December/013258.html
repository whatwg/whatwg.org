<PRE>&gt;<i> That's not unreasonable, but you have yet to give a solid technical
</I>&gt;<i> reason for reverting to the old text,
</I>
Reasons to put the Ogg tech suite back on the spec:

- it's Free (who here hates beer or freedom?)
- it's patent-unencumbered (this is a FACT)
- it's technically very good (Theora) or even superb (Vorbis and FLAC)
- it's widely available and readily installable
- it's being integrated in popular Web browsers RIGHT NOW
- it enables little guys to produce content at minimal cost

COME ON, what other reasons do you need?

&gt;<i> so far your only argument is that ogg should be kept because it is
</I>&gt;<i> FOSS, which on its own is insufficient.
</I>
I just gave you N more reasons.

&gt;<i> As far as wording goes using the word &quot;SHOULD support&quot; is far too
</I>&gt;<i> weak for HTML5, as SHOULD is relatively
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless, a much better requirement is that the wording be &quot;MUST
</I>&gt;<i> support ...&quot;; this is a sensible as
</I>&gt;<i> having a spec that says &quot;SHOULD support ogg/vorbis and ogg/theora&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> fairly useless -- all that will happen
</I>&gt;<i> is that browser vendors (Apple, Mozilla, Opera, etc) will once again
</I>&gt;<i> be in a position where the spec's wording
</I>&gt;<i> means nothing and we end up with yet another standard which is not
</I>&gt;<i> tied to whatever becomes the actual
</I>&gt;<i> de facto standard, as implemented by the majority browser.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> much worse for site compatibility for every
</I>&gt;<i> other browser as it then becomes necessary to determine what the de
</I>&gt;<i> facto standard actually *is*.
</I>
This is not the year 2000. Mozilla and Opera are embedding Theora video.  
That's a user base large enough to force the rest of the players to get with 
the program.

Solid technical, philosophical and practical reasons to move Ogg to MUST.
