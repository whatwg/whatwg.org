Wait...Apple and Nokia posit an potential patent threat as justification
to remove the text, but patent and other &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; reasons
aren't justification for putting it back?

Great double standard there.

&gt;<i> My understanding based on the numerous comments from Ian is that a goal

</I>
&gt;<i> As far as wording goes using the word &quot;SHOULD support&quot; is far too weak

</I>&gt;<i> meaningless, a much better requirement is that the wording be &quot;MUST

</I>&gt;<i> having a spec that says &quot;SHOULD support ogg/vorbis and ogg/theora&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> fairly useless -- all that will happen
</I>&gt;<i> is that browser vendors (Apple, Mozilla, Opera, etc) will once again be

</I>&gt;<i> means nothing and we end up with yet another standard which is not tied

</I>&gt;<i> worse for site compatibility for every
</I>&gt;<i> other browser as it then becomes necessary to determine what the de
</I>&gt;<i> facto standard actually *is*.
</I>
I agree...it should be a MUST rather than a SHOULD.  But that is an
independent question of what codecs are involved.

&gt;<i> For this reason the old text was insufficient and Ian changed the text
</I>&gt;<i> to indicate that the final wording had
</I>&gt;<i> not yet been decided.  This is not an indication that ogg transport or
</I>&gt;<i> that the vorbis or theora codecs are
</I>&gt;<i> being ignored, it is merely an indication that a decision has not yet
</I>&gt;<i> been made as to the final wording.
</I>
Then why change the text at all?  Just leave what was there why the
discussion happens.  Again, doesn't pass the smell test.

Yeah, I'm probably just assuming the worst from the big companies here,
but assuming the worst from big companies in past standards setting
efforts has *NEVER* resulted in me being surprised, so you'll just have
to deal with me taking a bit of an extreme position, here.

So if the discussion is really still up in the air, let me suggest this.

As a show of good faith, revert the text, then have the discussion.  If
a better solution is found that meets everyone's criteria, hey great.
But reverting the text to what it was can be considered a show of good
faith since, clearly, the text that was put in its place can't stand for
the spec to go to fruition.
