And all those other analyses have yielded us this stalemate?

I disagree on the discussion getting offensive.  We aren't calling each other 
names (for the record, calling a company names isn't calling each other 
names, and so far not even that has happened much).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And even if Apple gets sued for patent infringement, that doesn't mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the suit has merits -- experts already looked at the evidence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; surrounding Vorbis and patentability, and unanimously said &quot;it's clear&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cool.  Bring them on.  We might even *buy* patent insurance from
</I>&gt;<i> them, who knows?  Money for jam, right?
</I>
Buy your patent insurance from a third party that is not involved with the 
research done by the Xiph foundation.  Just as we ALSO want a codec that is 
not involved in the machinations of the proprietary companies.

That is a testament to the value of standards.  No one ever said you didn't 
make standards.  I claimed you made *proprietary* standards.  Playpens where 
only the big boys get to play and the rest get to pay.  But in all fairness, 
I should bring up that you also made Zeroconf possible, and that's awesome.
