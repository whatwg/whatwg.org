What does &quot;turn this off&quot; mean, exactly? What are you turning off? If you 
just &quot;turn off&quot; the current algorithms for drawing lines, you don't get 
different lines, you get no lines. What is it you want instead? Consider 
in particular lines drawn on high-res displays, lines drawn from 0,0.5 to 
100,0.5, animations, etc.

It is defined:

&quot;The CanvasRenderingContext2D 2D rendering context represents a flat 
linear Cartesian surface whose origin (0,0) is at the top left corner, 
with the coordinate space having x values increasing when going right, and 
y values increasing when going down. The x-coordinate of the right-most 
edge is equal to the width of the rendering context's scratch bitmap in 
CSS pixels; similarly, the y-coordinate of the bottom-most edge is equal 
to the height of the rendering context's scratch bitmap in CSS pixels.&quot;

The answer is the intersection.

It is indeed the idea that led to this part of the thread. :-)

The problem is, it's not clear what that would mean exactly:

</I>
That's one way to design the API, but it doesn't seem to be the only way. 
Another way is the way the API is currently written: you have paths, and 
when you fill them, you get pixels. No need for the intermediate &quot;region&quot; 
concept. I don't understand why you don't like that approach. You can do 
unions and so forth with just paths, no need for regions.


&gt;<i> The same is true for text. (Your recent addition that describes a stroke 
</I>&gt;<i> as sweeping a line following the path, is starting to align with that.)
</I>
I don't understand why the new description would be in any way different 
than the previous one. It's clearer, hopefully, and maybe less ambiguous 
in some cases, but it's still just describing converting one path into 
another path.


&gt;<i> The path object should represent the path in the graphics state. You 
</I>&gt;<i> can't add a stroked path or text outline to the graphics state and then 
</I>&gt;<i> fill/stroke it.

Why not?


&gt;<i> currentPath which was added by WebKit and Blink, makes that clear.
</I>
I don't see how currentPath impacts this one way or the other.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, for that you need a new API function, e.g. union, which as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I've mentioned before, I think would be a logical addition to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; API in due course. But I don't think we should add features too 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly, lest we get too far ahead of browsers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So please remove the APIs such as AddPathByStrokingPath that rely on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; these difficult algorithms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those APIs have to know how to turn strokes and text into paths (which 
</I>&gt;<i> is not trivial and no UA does by default). In addition if you want to

</I>&gt;<i> a description of the issue.
</I>
We seem to be going around in circles. We're in agreement that eventually 
we should add APIs for combining paths such that we get the equivalent of 
the union of their fill regions. I agree that converting text into paths 
is non-trivial (lots of stuff browsers do is non-trivial, that's kind of 
the point -- if it was trivial, we could leave it for authors). But I 
don't see how we get from there to you wanting the existing APIs removed.

Personally I think the name is fine, and it's shipped. However, if other 
vendors want to use another name, then I'll follow whatever the majority 
of implementors use, and I hope the other vendors will adopt it too.

We're moving towards using constructors more because that's the JavaScript 
language idiom for creating new objects. Old DOM APIs didn't use 
constructors because they were designed to be used outside browsers as 
well, but we've since given up with that design goal for Web APIs.

It's still bound to a context. The constructors are properties of the 
global object.

I don't think that's a problem in practice, though. It's not like you'd

Why wouldn't we use Path for 2D and 3D? (It's hard to know without a

The thread concluded with several people agreeing that we should rename 
Path to Path2D. As noted above, if this is what browsers implement, I will 
make sure to update the spec accordingly. Right now I'm only aware of one 
implementation, which calls it Path, so I've not yet updated the spec.

The only methods for which the spec currently requires user agents to

addText(), addPathByStrokingText(), and addPathByStrokingPath().


&gt;<i> Also it may be helpful to provide an accurate/formal description of what

The spec doesn't use that term (I don't know that it's actually possible 
to create a winding agnostic path in the general case -- consider a figure 
of eight inside an ellipse, for instance). The only places where it 
currently has a requirement of this nature is where the paths are 
generated entirely by the UA in a manner that they can be guaranteed to 
not cross themselves.

Why? With Path objects, you don't have to set them at all -- just paint

Being able to get a Path from the context if it exists seems reasonable, 
though it's non-trivial to define what that is given the way that 
transforms affect the context implied path.

(The right question is &quot;does anyone want these methods&quot;. The bar is 
higher than just no objections.)

What's the use case for setCurrentPath()?

The functionality of a getCurrentPath() method seems reasonable for the 
reasons J&#252;rg gave above.

Another way to do it would be to have the Path constructor take a 
rendering context object. That would be more consistent with how Path 
objects work so far.

The scale() call here has no effect. The default path is affected by 
transforms when you add the path segments, not when you paint. It would be 
consistent to do the same when converting it to a Path object.

This would, of course, mean that this wouldn't have the expected effect 
with transforms, since they'd be amplified:

   c.beginPath();
   c.scale(2,2);
   c.moveTo(0,0);
   c.lineTo(1,1);
   var p = new Path(c);
   c.stroke(); // strokes the current default path from 0,0 to 2,2
   c.stroke(p); // strokes p from 0,0 to 4,4 !

   c.resetTransform();
   c.stroke(p); // strokes the current default path from 0,0 to 2,2

You'd get a point.

&gt;<i> - how do patterns operate? the same for gradient fills.
</I>
This is defined:

&quot;If a radial gradient or repeated pattern is used when the transformation 
matrix is singular, the resulting style must be transparent black 
(otherwise the gradient or pattern would be collapsed to a point or line, 
leaving the other pixels undefined). Linear gradients and solid colors 
always define all points even with singular tranformation matrices.&quot;

&gt;<i> - how would you pass this to the underlying graphics library?
</I>
That's an implementation detail.

&gt;<i> - certain operators such as 'arc' rely on doing the transform in reverse.
</I>
If the transform is scale(0,0), an arc will always just result in a point.

I don't understand why the current text in the spec is not sufficient.

As far as I can tell, the spec is clear. Several of the browsers are 
clearly wrong.

I'm not sure what you mean there. Changing the transformation matrix 
shouldn't affect the current default path, per spec. stroke() and fill(), 
with no arguments, are only affected by the current transformation matrix 
insofar as it affects the actual stroke style or fill style.

As far as I can tell, you should get a black triangle with coordinates 
100,100, 200,100, and 0,0, with no stroke. (The line width gets scaled to 
zero, but the fill is defined across all space as black, by default.)
