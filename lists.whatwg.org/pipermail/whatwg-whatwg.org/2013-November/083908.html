Or when set to display:inline, for that matter.

</I>
By that argument, as &lt;select size=&quot;10&quot;&gt; is a non-replaced if the 
&lt;option&gt;s are rendered by the rules of CSS (which in Gecko they are, by 
the way).  But I don't see anyone making that argument...  I don't think 
it's any more valid for a button.

Basically, the concept of &quot;replaced element&quot; as you interpret it is not 
quite flexible enough to describe all the things that &quot;don't behave like 
normal CSS boxes&quot; that we have around.  But as I understand, the purpose 
of the concept was precisely to describe all such things.

&gt;<i> It does respond to 'display'
</I>
So does &lt;img&gt;.

&gt;<i> just not as you'd expect. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> setting it to display:table doesn't make it a table on the inside:
</I>
Yes....

&gt;<i> Setting it to 'table-row' doesn't make it a row on the outside:
</I>
Just like &lt;img&gt;, odd.

&gt;<i> Setting it to 'display:block' does seem to make a difference, though:

Hey, like &lt;img&gt;.  ;)

&gt;<i> Browsers (I mainly tested Gecko and WebKit) are remarkably interoperable
</I>&gt;<i> around this.
</I>
Yes, they've basically reverse-engineered each other, I expect.  Even a 
few years ago there was less interop here.

&gt;<i> If anyone has any suggestions on how to spec this, I'm eager to here
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>
I could probably describe how Gecko implements &lt;button&gt; if you would 
like.  Either here or in 
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=23893">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=23893</A>&gt;.  Just let me 
know.  In rough terms it acts like a replaced element with some custom 
sizing behavior for display-outside purposes and more or less like a 
block for display-inside purposes.  Much like 
&lt;svg&gt;&lt;foreignObject&gt;content&lt;/foreignObject&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; except without 
establishing a new absolute containing block (unless positioned) or CSS 
viewport... There's a lot of details, obviously.
