The attributes I have presented are not necessarily set in stone. They
can be inlined or improved. I am only introducing a new early logic of
implementation.

I am normal web developer myself. It so much easier to me than having to
repeat a path again and again in a very long endless 'value', that keeps
repeating the same logic over and over for every image,especially in the
case of a gallery of images.

I think the way it segments concerns into separate parts actually makes it
much legible.

You can discern right way how many set of images you have. Say a plugin
which introduce its new image definition within the platform, is
identifiable right way.

The css breakpoints themselves could be tokenized, but I didn't get to
that part.

</I>
Regex is already part of the HTML5 form validation syntax. It's not any
more unusable or slow than the 'pattern' attribute for the input element.

I very much dislike the use of regex in an interpreted language, but the
argument 
that regex done by the browser would be slow, is not even a slight remote
concern.
The amount of bytes that srcset or src-N will bear onto the download of a
page is
worth way more milliseconds in waiting time, that it is for a couple regex
to 
execute in c++...

Any normal web developer who suck at regex rules (myself included) does
not really need to understand regex either. Good examples on stackoverflow
would be sufficient for that.
