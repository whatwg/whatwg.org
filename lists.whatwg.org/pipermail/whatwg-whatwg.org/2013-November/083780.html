</I>

To be clear, I really like the idea of a style-based responsive image solution, as it involves significantly less additional syntax and may avoid some repetition. I just want to make sure whatever we come up with does not have any undesirable side effects.

I can't get this particular example to work in Safari, Chrome or Firefox. Is it meant to? It seems to always show foo.jpg. Here's a worked version with distinct images for each filename:

-------------- next part --------------


The reason I tried is because I want to see what side effects this approach might have without having to guess that from the specs.

It seems like the blockers to this syntax working as-is are:
- For Safari and Chrome, url(attr()) doesn't work.
- For Safari and Chrome, content: replaced url() doesn't work. I couldn't find a spec for the 'content' property that includes the 'replaced' token so I am not sure what it is even supposed to do.
- For Firefox, the 'content' property doesn't work on an element (as opposed to :before and :after)..

I did not get a chance to test IE.

I was able to get Safari and Chrome to work by getting rid of 'replaced' and specifying the images in CSS instead of using url(attr). With those changes, I noted the following possibly undesirable effects:

(1) Saving the image from the context menu (or opening in a new tab or window, or other context menu operations like copy) always uses the &quot;src&quot; image instead of the selected image. Dragging it uses the correct image.
(2) Preloading will always preload the src (and I suspect the normal loader would do it to so that both the image src and the content: replaced source will be loaded).

#1 would likely be fixed by a more thorough 'content' implementation. #2 could presumably be fixed by a CSS-aware preload scanner and by tweaking the img implementation, but the scanner would have to know how to apply CSS selectors as it scans, since resolution of a CSS selector is what determines the right attribute to load. The problem though is when attempting to implement a polyfill of some kind. The polyfill would not be able to prevent 'src' from loading as an additional resource. This could possibly be addressed by not specifying a regular 'src' at all when using a polyfill.

Other than these two details, it seems like a good solution to the problem. Implementing url(attr()) and these quality-of-implementation improvements would possibly be simpler than src-n as currently specified, and it exposes a lot less new syntax.

Regards,
Maciej
