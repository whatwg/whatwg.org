You are taking it personally on a misread, and my admittedly exaggerated
verbose to criticize your counter-argument. By 'current practices', I was
solely referring to the average length of image paths, which you gave me
no factual argument other than &quot;I&#185;d say the likelihood&quot; is &#179;very slim.&#178;
with non practical examples.

I was partly aware of your background, but that's besides the point of
this argument.

Please just don't qualify my example as 'exaggeration' with a fictitious
'more common representation of usage' in term of average char length.
The average src path of an img on the web is between 50 to 70 chars.

That's the sole point of my argument here, as per my examples.

And I don't know why you seem to talk about 'hotlinked' images as a
special category... I just hope that your argument is not that
Hotlinked/Cloud/CDN images don't apply to src-N or srcset, which is what I
first read.

Yoav, I didn't feel the need to point to non-existing studies to prove
a fairly obvious point, other that citing something a dozen examples
mentioning with wordpress + drupal which roughly cover 50% of cms usage
stats, or over 30% of the web.

But if you must have those particular facts, here they are:

Neither do I. I am talking about the resulting size of an HTML page, and
readability of src-N code in the broad context of debugging.
Not code editing per say. I don't recall saying that the code had to be
editing friendly.

&gt;<i>A more accurate example in terms of actual authoring with any of things
</I>&gt;<i>you&#185;ve cited above&#139;specific variable syntax notwithstanding&#139;would be
</I>&gt;<i>something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;img 
</I>&gt;<i>src=&quot;{img1}&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>src-1=&quot;100% (30em) 50% (50em) calc(33% - 100px);
</I>&gt;<i>          {img1} 100,
</I>&gt;<i>          {img2} 200,
</I>&gt;<i>          {img3} 400,
</I>&gt;<i>          {img4} 800,
</I>&gt;<i>          {img5} 1600,
</I>&gt;<i>          {img6} 3200&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>alt=&quot;[&#138;]&quot;&gt;
</I>
I am not concerned about the authoring of it. Not sure why you are
referring to authoring with that example? I am actually not sure you are
getting my point about 'bloat' and whether your couter-argument actually
talk about the same thing...

&gt;<i>But for the sake of discussion, I&#185;m fine with inflating any syntax
</I>&gt;<i>pattern up for discussion equally with hotlinked Flickr URLs, since
</I>&gt;<i>there&#185;s really no point in arguing either way. &#179;Six of one, sixty
