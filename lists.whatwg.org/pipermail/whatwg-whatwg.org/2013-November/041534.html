I agree that &lt;source&gt; as specified for &lt;video&gt; and initially for &lt;picture&gt;  
was a mess, but that doesn't have to be the case. The complexity was  
mainly caused by stateful algorithm exposed to JS, which is not necessary  
for &lt;picture&gt;.


It's *is* possible to have use N elements atomically.


I've specified a simplified &lt;source&gt; selection algorithm[1] that achieves  
this. It is atomic from JS perspective.

Atomicity is achieved by always scheduling the selection algorithm to run  
on next tick (event loop spin) after mutation. This way JS can perform  
several mutations in a row without worrying about race conditions.

The algorithm I've specified is also stateless and works correctly with  
incomplete data (e.g. if packet boundary happens to be inside &lt;picture&gt;).

AFAIK it makes it as easy to implement and as safe to use as src-N.

Simon, who initially raised concerns about use of &lt;source&gt; in &lt;picture&gt;  
found that solution acceptable[2].

I'd love to hear feedback about simplified, atomic &lt;source&gt; from other  
vendors.
