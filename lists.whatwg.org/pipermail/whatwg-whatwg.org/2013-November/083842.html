I think you're overthinking this. A checkbox represents an input with
binary state. As I understand it, whether the input is immediate or
takes effect only on some kind of submission is defined by context -
specifically, whether the checkbox is associated with a form with a
submit button. This does not affect the fact that the input is
fundamentally binary.

In contrast, a button represents a single action, atomic from the
user's point of view. Pressing the button again should (it seems to
me) logically perform the same action again; if the action performed
every time the button is pressed can only be described as something
like &quot;toggle the X&quot;, you've done something wrong in your design. You
should be able to make a checkbox look like a button (albeit, one
presumes, one that remains &quot;pushed&quot; in order to represent its state),
and *could* even make a button look like a checkbox (although I can't
imagine why you would want to), but they represent different things
underneath.

A toggle or switch is an input with binary state. Therefore, it is a
checkbox, with a different shape from usual. Incidentally, in the case
of text to the sides of a styled switch, as mentioned above, it seems
clear to me that the actual switch part in the middle is the input,
and the text parts are labels, all inside an outer frame block.
