This will never work; for legacy compat reasons, url() is not a
function, but a syntax construct specially recognized and handled by
the parser.  (Don't nest incompatible microsyntaxes, kids!)
url(attr()) is compatibly a bad-url token right now.

However, &quot;attr(foo url)&quot; does work, at least per spec.  I don't think
it's been implemented yet.

&gt;<i> - For Safari and Chrome, content: replaced url() doesn't work. I couldn't find a spec for the 'content' property that includes the 'replaced' token so I am not sure what it is even supposed to do.
</I>
Yes, this has been a longstanding suggestion to make a 'content' image
actually make the image replaced, as opposed to its current behavior
which inserts an anonymous replaced-element child into it.  As
fantasai and I haven't significantly picked up the Content spec
lately, we haven't added it yet.

&gt;<i> - For Firefox, the 'content' property doesn't work on an element (as opposed to :before and :after)..
</I>
This is just a lack of implementation.

&gt;<i> I was able to get Safari and Chrome to work by getting rid of 'replaced' and specifying the images in CSS instead of using url(attr). With those changes, I noted the following possibly undesirable effects:
</I>
It didn't actually work - if you try to size the element, you'll note
that the images don't care.

&gt;<i> (1) Saving the image from the context menu (or opening in a new tab or window, or other context menu operations like copy) always uses the &quot;src&quot; image instead of the selected image. Dragging it uses the correct image.
</I>
Sounds like something that could potentially be fixed.

&gt;<i> (2) Preloading will always preload the src (and I suspect the normal loader would do it to so that both the image src and the content: replaced source will be loaded).
</I>
This is because the preloader doesn't understand CSS yet.
