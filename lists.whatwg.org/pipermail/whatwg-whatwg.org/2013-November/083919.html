Putting it that way makes it sound like what the spec says here is 
controversial, but really, it's not. HTML has never supported other 
elements in &lt;option&gt;s either at the conformance level or the parser level 
(it's one of the few elements with dedicated rules in the parser), the 
backwards-compatible rendering requires blatently non-CSS behaviour like 
hiding text nodes, making &lt;select&gt;s match platform conventions is 
incompatible with making it stylable at this level given how varied the 
platforms are, etc.

If we wanted to make &lt;option&gt; stylable, we'd have to define how it worked, 
and that would be non-trivial.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Some do not. How are they not replaced elements in the latter?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what it would mean for them to be replaced elements. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;select&gt; is a replaced element, but its contents have no bearing on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the CSS spec at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, how is this different from &lt;svg&gt; being a replaced element

</I>&gt;<i> should be different?
</I>
It's more like &lt;svg:g&gt;. The CSS model just doesn't apply. Even in Firefox, 
it's not really CSS that's working there. It's some weird proprietary 
variant. I mean, as you've pointed out, child nodes of the &lt;select&gt; that 
aren't &lt;option&gt; or &lt;optgroup&gt; are mysteriously hidden, but also, the 
&lt;option&gt; elements obey some values of 'display' but don't obey e.g. 
'position' or 'float'; 'white-space' doesn't seem to work right in a 
&lt;select&gt; or &lt;option&gt;; the height of the &lt;select&gt; seems to be based in some 
weird way on the height of some of the &lt;option&gt;s... in the drop-down mode, 
it's even worse, with the text not lining up with the widget, and so on. 

(By the way, in testing this, I discovered &lt;option label&gt; isn't supported 
in Firefox. Also, the default styles for &lt;select&gt; drop-downs on Mac don't 
seem to match platform convensiots. Also, I don't know what's going on in 
this mess of a test, but clicking the drop-down widget causes Firefox to 
peg the CPU on my machine on Firefox 26:

HTH. Also ::first-line on a display:table-row doesn't seem to be work, 
though I couldn't tell if that was per-spec or not. It doesn't seem to 
work for regular &lt;div&gt;s either.)
