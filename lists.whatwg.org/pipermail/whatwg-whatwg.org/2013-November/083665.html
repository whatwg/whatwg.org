</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; It's easy to look at something more complex than what you're used to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; in this case.  The things I'm addressing are the things that RICG

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Big +1 to that -- src-N addresses all the RICG use cases in a
</I>consistent and
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; coherent way..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think that's a valuable goal.  My preference would be to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address only the device-pixel-ratio use case in this iteration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you explain why?
</I>
It's for the reason in the second paragraph of my previous email: I don't
think we'll get agreement about how to address the other use cases in the
near term and I view the device-pixel-ratio use case as important to
address in the near term.

&gt;<i> I believe the RICG's identified use-cases are
</I>&gt;<i> both reasonable and minimal.  If we address *only* the density case
</I>&gt;<i> right now, significant fractions of *existing* responsive images code
</I>&gt;<i> won't be able to migrate to the standardized solution, and will be
</I>&gt;<i> stuck with hacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll obviously never be able to satisfy 100% of use-cases, nor is
</I>&gt;<i> anyone trying to.  But just density isn't enough, based on the
</I>&gt;<i> observed patterns in the wild.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and is the only option that does so. Serving images in our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; new multi-device / responsive design world *is* a much harder problem
</I>and
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the &quot;complexity&quot; of src-N is simply a reflection of that.. Sticking our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; heads in the sand and pretending that this is not the case, or punting
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; problem down the road (as we've already done for the past few years),
</I>is not
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a sound strategy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we wait for agreement about how to address the other use cases, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't ship anything for a long time.  I'd rather ship something that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful today and iterate to improve it in the future than not ship
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything for a long time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The RICG and related community has agreed on src-N, and the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> Blink and FF devs have as well.  The only holdout is WebKit,
</I>
That's exactly the problem.  The WebKit community has been clear they don't
want to ship src-N.

&gt;<i> but they
</I>&gt;<i> haven't expressed any technical objections, just aesthetic ones.
</I>&gt;<i> (And, not to be rude, but I don't trust the aesthetic judgement of C++
</I>&gt;<i> hackers when applied to the web platform; at least, not over the
</I>&gt;<i> judgement of actual JS and HTML hackers, who are generally fine with
</I>&gt;<i> the look of src-N.  People who write the web rather than write *in*
</I>&gt;<i> the web have a long history of liking terribly-shaped APIs because
</I>&gt;<i> they're more familiar to C++ coders.)  (IE hasn't expressed an opinion
</I>&gt;<i> one way or the other, as usual.)
</I>
You might not find their reasons compelling, but that's largely beside the
point.  What's relevant is that they aren't willing to ship src-N.  Maybe
through additional discussion we could find a mutually agreeable approach
for addressing the remaining use cases, but that appears unlikely to happen
in the near term.

&gt;<i> I believe you're applying an inappropriately high standard of required
</I>&gt;<i> agreement to this proposal, compared to what the usual required level
</I>&gt;<i> is for something to be accepted.
</I>
If Blink ships src-N and WebKit ships srcset, we'll have a mess on our
hands.  Authors will end up using both.  If they do, they're likely to have
different behavior in different browsers, which is an interoperability
problem.

The best solution I see to the above constraints is to ship
device-pixel-ratio switching via srcset today and to continue to discuss
how to address the remaining use cases in the future.
