Remember that we only *have* two use-cases that require different
results - resolution choosing and art direction based on viewport
breakpoints.  These are well-supported as common and necessary
operations, done commonly on existing websites using the various
responsive image hacks.

The final clause that a few people keep hating on is, as I explain in
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.xanthir.com/b4Su0">http://www.xanthir.com/b4Su0</A>&gt; solely a mechanism for reducing the
*enormous* verbosity that can arise from the existing solutions in
fairly simple, reasonable cases.  (It's also automatically robust
against gains in resolution, whereas the existing solution requires
increasing the verbosity *even further* to make it robust.)

It's easy to look at something more complex than what you're used to
and dismiss all the excess as unneeded, but it's really, seriously not
in this case.  The things I'm addressing are the things that RICG
research found were common and necessary, no more and no less.
