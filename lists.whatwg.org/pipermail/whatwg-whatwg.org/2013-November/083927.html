It's really not, once you have a DOM and are inside &lt;option&gt;.

&gt;<i> I mean, as you've pointed out, child nodes of the &lt;select&gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> aren't &lt;option&gt; or &lt;optgroup&gt; are mysteriously hidden
</I>
That's &lt;select&gt;, not &lt;option&gt;.

&gt;<i> but also, the &lt;option&gt; elements obey some values of 'display' but don't obey e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 'position' or 'float';
</I>
That's pure CSS: it's a !important rule in a UA stylesheet.  I guess you 
could claim that supporting !important in a UA stylesheet is a 
proprietary extension, albeit one that's in the process of being specified.

&gt;<i> 'white-space' doesn't seem to work right in a &lt;select&gt; or &lt;option&gt;;
</I>
   option { white-space: nowrap !important; }

in UA stylesheet.

&gt;<i> the height of the &lt;select&gt; seems to be based in some
</I>&gt;<i> weird way on the height of some of the &lt;option&gt;s...
</I>
That's about &lt;select&gt;, not &lt;option&gt;.

&gt;<i> in the drop-down mode, it's even worse
</I>
My comments were specifically about &lt;option&gt; in a listbox.  A combobox 
is a different and more complicated story (though even there the layout 
of the &lt;option&gt; itself is pure CSS in Gecko).

Put another way, there is no custom layout code for &lt;option&gt; in Gecko. 
It's all done entirely by the CSS renderer, based on the computed values 
of CSS properties for the element.  Some of those computed values come 
from !important rules in a UA stylesheet, but that's it.

&gt;<i> (By the way, in testing this, I discovered &lt;option label&gt; isn't supported
</I>&gt;<i> in Firefox.
</I>
That's correct.  <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40545">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40545</A>

&gt;<i> HTH. Also ::first-line on a display:table-row doesn't seem to be work,
</I>&gt;<i> though I couldn't tell if that was per-spec or not. It doesn't seem to
</I>&gt;<i> work for regular &lt;div&gt;s either.)
</I>
::<i>first-line on a display:table-row shouldn't work in Gecko right now, 
</I>yes.  Whether it's per-spec depends on which spec you're reading and the 
phase of the moon.  ;)

It should work on a block, of course, and does in my testing.
