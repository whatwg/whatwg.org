</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If Blink ships src-N and WebKit ships srcset, we'll have a mess on our

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The best solution I see to the above constraints is to ship
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> device-pixel-ratio switching via srcset today and to continue to discuss how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to address the remaining use cases in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> srcset is a cul de sac with respect to these goals. Let's look at our
</I>&gt;<i> options:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) + srcset addresses resolution-switching.
</I>&gt;<i> (2) + in theory, srcset provides basic facilities for viewport-switching -
</I>&gt;<i> although none of the current implementations support it.
</I>&gt;<i> (3) - srcset viewport-switching syntax is a disaster for real-world
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios [1]
</I>
Agreed.  I recommend removing viewport switching from srcset and
addressing only the device-pixel-ratio use case.

&gt;<i> (4) - srcset does not provide any easy way to extend itself for art
</I>&gt;<i> direction
</I>
That's ok.  We'll just need to add another mechanism in the future to
address art direction.

&gt;<i> By contrast, src-N is a superset: it covers (1) and (2), with same syntax
</I>&gt;<i> even; it addresses (3); it enables (4).
</I>
Unfortunately, src-N is no-go because WebKit refuses to implement it.
Now, it's possible you'll convince them that it's not &quot;a grotesque
perversion of the HTML language&quot; (which does seems a bit hyperbolic),
but that seems unlikely to happen in the near term.  Given the tenor
of that discussion, I'd expect we'll need to come up with a new
approach and involve stakeholders from the WebKit community earlier in
the design process.

&gt;<i> We have Mozilla and RICG behind src-N, and I hope Blink can put its weight
</I>&gt;<i> behind it also..
</I>
There's certainly interest in src-N from the Blink community, but
we're unlikely to ship something here that WebKit refuses to
implement.

&gt;<i> I hope we can all work with Webkit team to address their
</I>&gt;<i> concerns and solve this problem once and for all.
</I>
Me too.  However, I don't want to wait for that to happen.  I want to
ship something that addresses the device-pixel-ratio use case in the
near term and continue discussing how to address the remaining use
cases.

&gt;<i> So far, as Tab has pointed
</I>&gt;<i> out, the src-N concerns we've heard are all cosmetic, and I think those
</I>&gt;<i> discussions are distracting us from the real conversation we should be
</I>&gt;<i> having, which is... how is srcset planning to address its shortcomings in a
</I>&gt;<i> better way than src-N?
</I>
It's not.  The only use case srcset will address is the
device-pixel-ratio use case.
