</I>
You can s/src-1/srcset/ this example; the two are identical for this use-case.

&gt;&gt;<i> The simplest one isn't much worse, granted.  It suffers from the &quot;put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an id on it&quot; that makes working with &lt;label&gt;/&lt;input&gt; a minor chore,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but otherwise is mostly just shifting things around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure you can use ids. But the idea behind the CSS proposal was to allow
</I>&gt;<i> better sharing of the breakpoint media queries.
</I>
Not really.  PreloaderCSS gives you two choices, both bad:

1. Put the image sources in a &lt;style&gt; next to each &lt;img&gt;, thus
repeating your layout breakpoints in the MQs multiple times. (This
weakness is shared by src-N.)
2. Or put all your image sources in a single &lt;style&gt; block somewhere
in the page, requiring people to look in two places for image sources
and virtually guaranteeing that the fallback url in &lt;img src&gt; will be
ignored and fall out of sync.  You still have your breakpoints in at
least *two* places though - once in your in-page &lt;style&gt; block, and
once in your external CSS.

I think #1 is better, as we can solve it with Custom MQs/MQ
Variables/whatever, which the CSSWG is already kosher with (and I'll
be writing up soon).  Once that's solved, much of the problems of this
approach disappear for both src-N and PreloaderCSS.

&gt;<i> Using ids doesn't share,
</I>&gt;<i> using a class would. Src-N you have no choice but to repeat everything
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere.
</I>
Why would you be using classes?  Most images that you need to make
responsive are one-off content images, like the big picture in
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/11/10">http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/11/10</A>&gt; (and maybe the
picture in the sidebar).

The only reason to use a class is if:

1. You're displaying the exact same image multiple times on the same page.
2. *And* it's for some reason appropriate/important as a content
image, rather than just using a standard (and totally okay) CSS
image-replacement method.
3. *And* it's large enough that you actually care about the increased
weight from higher densities.  (Gimme an 8x retweet arrow; who cares?)

I respectfully submit that images matching all three of these criteria
are so low-occurrence as to be mistaken for noise.

Even on a site that uses a *lot* of images that could benefit from
responsiveness, like Vogue &lt;<A HREF="http://www.vogue.com/">http://www.vogue.com/</A>&gt;, all of them are
one-offs.

So, let's be honest here - using classes in PreloaderCSS was *never*
something people were actually going to do.  It's all about IDs and
just shifting all the src-N stuff from attributes to an adjacent style
block.

&gt;&gt;<i> These examples... do not look good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They look better in an editor. CSS is syntax highlighted. Src-N's format
</I>&gt;<i> isn't and likely would never be &#8212; as most HTML attributes aren't.
</I>
While &quot;the tools will save us&quot; is not generally a useful argument,
syntax highlighting is easy peasy.  I could add this to Sublime's HTML
highlighter in half an hour max, and it would only take that long
because I'm still not super-comfortable with the authoring format.
&quot;There's no syntax highlighting *yet*.&quot; isn't a very useful argument
here.
