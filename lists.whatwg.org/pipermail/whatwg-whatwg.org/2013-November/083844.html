I think there's a qualitative difference between &quot;this particular
thing is more complex than necessary in a way that virtually
guarantees it will be misused&quot; and &quot;no even slightly complicated
things should ever be allowed anywhere ever&quot;. *Not* worrying too much
about &quot;stupid&quot; doesn't mean that we have to do everything the hard
way, either.

&gt;<i> Perhaps, a reason I come to this conclusion, is that: An advantage with

</I>&gt;<i> any tokens at all.  As long as the With and Height are declared inline,

</I>&gt;<i> widths to get the right image.
</I>
Sure, but, like I said, that only works as far as you stick to the
rigid pattern for image names. As soon as you want to break the
pattern, or - heaven forfend! - *extend* it, it becomes a serious
liability, to say the least.

&gt;<i> Which makes src-N or srcset ever more so unnecessary for that particular
</I>&gt;<i> naming convention, that I'd rather almost have a few lines of inline
</I>&gt;<i> javascript do it in the head, for the Wordpress platform.
</I>

That's great, for the Wordpress platform. Everyone else might still
want responsive images that don't require them to emulate Wordpress.
