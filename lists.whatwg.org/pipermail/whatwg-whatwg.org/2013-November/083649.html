What Maciej said.  &quot;Just use scripts&quot; is, duh, the obvious answer (and
one that people KEEP GIVING OVER AND OVER).  The problem is that this
gates the picture loading behind a script-loading time barrier, while
we *want* pictures to start loading as soon as the preload scanner
sees them, as they do today.  This is a significant issue on mobile
networks especially, where time-to-request-start is very important for
the responsiveness of the page.

This sucks, because we can't program the preloader, and no one's got a
serious proposal for doing so.  So, you have to solve as much as
possible in the browser itself, rather than delegating to script.
