Exposing GC _in general_ is a big problem. In general, exposing GC makes 
it possible for a popular Web site to accidentally rely on the specific GC 
behaviour of a popular browser, leading to all browsers being forced to 
implement the same GC, so that they can be compatible with the popular 
site and thus gain market share.

Exposing GC in this specific case, though, seems like a way less serious 
concern. In order for a site to rely on the exposure of GC in this 
situation, it first has to _rely_, for proper operation, on the popular 
browsing in question reliably _crashing_. Subsequently, for other browsers 
to be cooerced into also _crashing_ (and having a specific GC behaviour), 
first the popular browser's implementors have to decide to not fix their 
crash, and the popular site has to decide to not fix their reliance on a 
crash, and the popular browser and site have to remain popular with users 
even as they keep crashing browsers as part of their &quot;proper&quot; operation, 
and the other browsers have to decide that actually supporting that site 
is so important that they should replicate not just the GC behaviour, but 
also the crash behaviour.

I find it incredibly unlikely that all those conditions would line up.
