</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; build their own rendering for &lt;select&gt;s that would have made the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; transition to mobile much more painful since you'd get a tiny custom
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;select&gt; UIs rather than a more platform-appropriate picker.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well, there's not much that can be done about that, as far as I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; tell.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Allowing targeting parts of the built-in UI using pseudo-elements would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go a long way. I.e. having a ::options-box pseudo-element as well as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other pseodu elements for other components of common implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This way the UA could ignore the style properties that it can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement or that doesn't make sense for its UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, agreed. Again, with XBL2, the goal was to define some default
</I>&gt;<i> bindings (in abstract, not concretely) that user agents were supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> default to, and those bindings would specify pseudos that specific
</I>&gt;<i> subparts mapped to (XBL2 had an xbl:pseudo attribute for this). You can
</I>&gt;<i> actually see the remnants of this in the HTML spec's rendering section,
</I>&gt;<i> where the widgets are defined in terms of the 'binding' property.
</I>
Defining the list of pseudo elements using a XBL2 binding or using prose is
just two was of doing the same thing. So yeah I think either would work.

The hard part is coming IP with the list I think.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; And then there's of course the separate-but-related issue of being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; able to style scrollbars, which is another reason websites create
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; sea-of-divs pages today. The reason this is related is that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; challenges styling form controls isn't really related to form
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; controls, but rather related to styling of UA-provided UI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Scrollbars is another such UI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Right. We never developed this very far, but with XBL2 the idea was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that we'd eventually let you override the binding of a '::scrollbox'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pseudo, or some such.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A scrollbar consists of multiple pieces, so you'll need more pseudo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elements. But yes, I think this is the right direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the idea is you'd bind to the scroll box to change the whole scroll
</I>&gt;<i> UI, but you could also then override specific pseudos of the scroll box to
</I>&gt;<i> style subparts of the default (or custom) scrollbox UI. This part was
</I>&gt;<i> never very well developed though since the core of XBL2 was never picked
</I>&gt;<i> up. But I think the same approach should probably still work with the
</I>&gt;<i> newer Web components work, no? It needs to be specified and implemented...
</I>
Web components can't define pseudo elements. So no.

This sadly also means that you can't write a CSS which styles the default
UA UI if that is used, and styles an attached Shadow DOM if that is used.

I think this is a big problem, so far no one else seems to care. I'd be
happy if more people provided this feedback to the spec authors.
