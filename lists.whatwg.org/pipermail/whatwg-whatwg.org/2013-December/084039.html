It's part of the HTML spec, FWIW.

</I>&gt;<i> breaking parts of the page.
</I>
I don't understand how we could do this in the case of a MessagePort 
sending an &quot;I'm dead&quot; message and disentangling when the other side is 
navigated. I mean, that's pretty fatal for the port.


&gt;<i> When we decide that is a problem worth fixing, we can discuss solutions 
</I>&gt;<i> separately.  Making the change being discussed here will not make that 
</I>&gt;<i> solution harder to specify or implement.
</I>
I don't understand why it wouldn't make it harder.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and given the fact that currently a solution for the case where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; page is navigated away from will need to register an unload event 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; handler (which also disables bfcache) we will be in no worse spot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; than we are today.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For pages that register the unload handler, sure. But if we do this, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we block _all_ pages that use MessagePorts from going into the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bfcache, because there's no way to know if the other side has a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registered handler for the event or not when you are navigated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that as I suggestion before, we can only blacklist a page for 
</I>&gt;<i> bfcache if the handler
</I>
...is registered, I assume.

Behaving differently based on whether a handler is registered or not is a 
violation of the platform's event semantics. The model is that events get 
fired regardless of whether a handler is present or not. We go to some 
lengths to keep that invariant.

In any case, finding out if the other side has a listener registered would 
need sync IPC, which seems like a non-starter to me.


&gt;<i> There are ways to avoid that synchronous IPC by delivering that 
</I>&gt;<i> information alongside with other IPC messages that you'd have to deliver 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless.
</I>
You don't have to do any sync IPC to remote processes when navigating, as 
far as I can tell. Can you elaborate on this?


&gt;<i> &gt; The event approach has the advantage that a no-op implementation need 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be nothing more than an IDL attribute event handler, something which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be a trivial burden given how common adding those is on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if I understand this point.  A Promise-based API should be 
</I>&gt;<i> just as easy to implement as a no-op (at least, given my understanding 
</I>&gt;<i> of how we generate the Javascript bindings from WebIDL files in Gecko 
</I>&gt;<i> these days.)
</I>
I don't understand how having something could be simpler than not having 
something. Maybe I'm missing something in the proposal.


&gt;<i> I can totally imagine this being harder in engines that don't do that 
</I>&gt;<i> kind of code generation, but the same could be said about event handlers 
</I>&gt;<i> too without knowing about the specifics of the implementation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> engine.
</I>
The difference is that event handlers are all over the place, and other 
than hooking a handler, don't have any requirements on implementations.


&gt;<i> &gt; Now, we could still handle your use case (Ehsan and I chatted about 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this on IRC yesterday; the problem is what to do if, for instance, a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port is being passed across multiple processes, and the OOM killer is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; essentially chasing the end-point, killing processes before they can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inform the final recipient that the source has itself been killed). 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's two obvious ways to do it; one is an attribute, the other is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to just send the event whenever a MessagePort is created if it's other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side is already known to be crashed. The one with the least impact on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no-op UAs is the event; that would also have the advantage of meaning 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you didn't have to know synchronously that the port was damaged goods. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with the attribute is that you might not get the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notification that the port is ill-fated until after you receive the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; port, even though the 'error' event has already fired (or tried to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fire) in some other process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So my proposal to handle this would be to send another 'error' event, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basically any time you create a MessagePort that's entangled with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone who has crashed already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to question whether that is a better API.  I can't think of 
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere else on the web platform where we have an event handler that 
</I>&gt;<i> fires in this specific manner (after the fact, and as soon as you 
</I>&gt;<i> register a handler for that event.)
</I>
The event doesn't fire when you register a handler, it fires (well, it's 
queued) when the object is created.


&gt;<i> But a Promise based solution at least has the advantage that the 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics of the Promise is well defined and consistent with everywhere 
</I>&gt;<i> else in the platform that Promises are used.  Do you disagree that there 
</I>&gt;<i> is a consistency and API quality issue here?
</I>
Yes. This seems the same to me as how an &lt;iframe&gt; gets a 'load' event when 
created, if it is created without a src=&quot;&quot; attribute, for example.
