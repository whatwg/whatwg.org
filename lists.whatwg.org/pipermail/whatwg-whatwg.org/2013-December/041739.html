</I>
Theoretically you can, but point taken.

I've added a feature to MessagePort that causes an 'error' event to be 
fired at a MessagePort if its other side is killed prematurely.

It doesn't fire when a port's owner document is navigated away from, 
because that would prevent the page from being bfcached, which we try hard 
to avoid. For pages it's reasonably easy to just hook into the document's 
onunload handler and send a message to all ports then.

It doesn't fire when a port's owner worker terminates, because it seems 
weird to fire it sometimes but not others when the owner closes. For 
dedicated workers there is unfortunately no unload handler, because that 
would similarly prevent the bfcache... Not sure what the right thing to do 
is there. We don't want to expose the bfcache eviction model either.

It doesn't fire for port.close() because that would let you probe GC 
behaviour, and you can easily just send a message first anyway.


&gt;<i> &gt; How often are we really expecting one tab to be talking to another

</I>&gt;<i> That is not the only use case.  Another use case which is currently more

</I>&gt;<i> side suffered an OOM crash for example, so that we can update the UI 
</I>&gt;<i> letting the user know that the music is no longer playing.
</I>
I understand that in practice this does occur, but it still seems like the 
right solution would be for the music app here to gracefully report that 
it has been asked by the operating system to shut down, and to then do so. 
And even then, that's presumably not what the user really wanted...

This feature won't help you there, since this is a case where the port is 
going away gracefully.

Is there any reason you can't just use onunload handlers to send a message 
to the shared worker when the page goes away?

It originally did have such a mechanism, actually, but we removed it to 
avoid exposing GC. So I guess it was &quot;definished&quot;. :-)

It dramatically reduces the ability for multiple implementations to have 
widely varying GC models.

We don't guarantee it when the host page is navigated (assuming that's 
what you mean by &quot;closes&quot;), because the user could go back to the page, in 
which case, if the page didn't use onunload=&quot;&quot; and various other things, 
it's possible for the page to just be reopenend unmodified, with the 
literally same live DOM and for the ports to continue to work.

Yeah. Unfortunately, that line of reasoning doesn't work on the Web. We're 
not avoiding exposing GC behaviour because we want to prevent authors from 
shooting themselves in the foot; we're avoiding exposing GC behaviour 
because wo want to prevent authors from shooting _us_ in the foot. :-)

If we expose GC, and a browser gets popular, it's likely that pages will 
unwittingly end up dependent on that browser's GC model, and then all 
other browsers get stuck implementing that GC model.

This is the same reason why all browsers now implement the same crazy 
parsing with all its wacky quirks that everyone says makes us look dumb.


&gt;<i> I guess I think people who misinterpret the spec and do things which are 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously a bad idea are only to a limited extent our problem.

It's not them who are our problem, it's their popular pages later.

</I>&gt;<i> documentation and are just guessing&quot;.
</I>
The Web will also not become a place where &quot;serious, large applications&quot; 
can be written if we end up constrained along every axis, unfortunately. 
(For example, if we can no longer innovate the GC model.)

The case of workers is pretty hard to handle well (without multiple ports

It would either prevent bfcache usage, or, if we did it only when the 
worker as reaped while in the bfcache, it would expose the bfcache 
eviction model (and likely wouldn't be sufficiently reliable anyway).

The spec defines the owner in (hopefully) rigorous detail.

The owner of port1 is the window that was navigated (and it is now in the 
bfcache, probably).
The owner of port2's clone is the shared worker.

No messages or events are sent in this example other than the explicit 
one (and the events around navigation, like pagehide).

I agree that it's not intuitive, but you need an explicit owner to 
determine which Document is responsible for the tasks that are sent on the 
event loop. Otherwise, if a page had a port and the page was navigated 
away from and then returned to, it might have missed all the events, or 
the events might have been fired while the scripts in that document 
weren't able to run properly (since the document isn't fully active).

That would break the bfcache.

&gt;<i> It occurs to me that all of the proposals here does expose some amount

</I>&gt;<i> the other side crashes exposes GC behavior. If GC happens to run before

</I>&gt;<i> GC runs later, or if it doesn't successfully collect the MessageChannel 
</I>&gt;<i> ports, then the &quot;channeldropped&quot; event does fire.
</I>
One would hope, however, that crashes can't be caused deterministically, 
and thus this doesn't actually let you dependen on GC behaviour. If you 
could, then the only way that this GC exposure would lead to a constraint 
compatibility state is if the page also depended on triggering a crash to 
work correctly. There's crazy stuff on the Web, but that would be pushing 
the envelope on crazy. I'm also pretty confident that browser vendors 
would be significantly more willing to break compatibility with a page 
that relied on triggering crashes in a specific way and the resulting GC 
behaviour being exposed in a specific way.


&gt;<i> One solution which I think would never expose GC behavior is to simply 
</I>&gt;<i> have a property on the MessagePort which indicates if the owner of the 
</I>&gt;<i> other side has been killed or navigated away from. No event would fire

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since it's a property, it can only be read if a reference to the 
</I>&gt;<i> MessagePort is being held. As long as such a reference exists neither 
</I>&gt;<i> side of the MessageChannel can be GCed.
</I>
Well, we could make the 'error' event handler also block GC, but that 
seems like it would be unfortunate. It would be a high memory cost for a 
hopefully very rarely-triggered feature.

(If we don't do that, then it's just a property with polling, and a 
property with polling isn't really any better than an event, as far as 
hiding GC behaviour goes. A property with polling is essentially how 
PortCollection exposes GC behaviour.)

on the TR/ page is about 18 months old, which in this space is _ancient_.)

In what sense?

If the port is GC'ed before the other side is destroyed, then you miss the 
message, but so what?

If the port is not GC'ed before the other side is destroyed, but could 
have been, then it exposes GC behaviour, but that seems like a very minor 
concern in this case, as noted in my response to Jonas above.

If the port is not GC'ed before the other side is destroyed, and could not 
have been, then it's the same as if you had a reference, so it seems like 
a non-issue.

Presumably the only case that this can matter is if the event is 
dispatched. If it gets GC'ed before then, then it didn't matter. I've made 
sure the spec says that while the event (any event, actually) is queued, 
the object can't go away.

It's what the spec says.

The GC behaviour is exposed _if one of the sides crashes_. As noted above, 
that's a case where even if we do expose GC behaviour, we're not likely to 
really constrain ourselves.

No, nothing is discarded, because of, as you say, the bfcache.

That would be very weird behaviour for an event.

But as designed, I think it works ok to just always hook the listener if 
you need it, since it doesn't prevent GC. So this is probably a non-issue.

I haven't done this. If this is something we do want to do, then I can 
spec it (the spec in fact used to do something like it), but it wasn't 
clear to me from this thread that this was the immediate need, and given 
the risks involved, I wanted to avoid scope creep.
