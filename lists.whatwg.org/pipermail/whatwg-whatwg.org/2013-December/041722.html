It's probably too late to change the name now.

</I>
What would _not_ be social? Isn't pretty much every Web page by definition 
a social interaction, since it was caused to be produced by one human, and 
was produced so as to cause some impact on another human?


&gt;<i> What we need is not marking up individual comments differently, but a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the case of someone using a screen-reader wanting to jump to 
</I>&gt;<i> comments. The only way to do that right now, is to hope that a comment 
</I>&gt;<i> link is around. But because there are no standards in terms of where 
</I>&gt;<i> that would be he/she has to skip through links. I would think that 
</I>&gt;<i> jumping to comments right away is potentially a slightly painful thing 
</I>&gt;<i> to do atm. And there are no landmark roles for that either that I know 
</I>&gt;<i> of.
</I>
An AT can provide a &quot;jump to comments&quot; feature quite easily -- the first 
comment is the first nested &lt;article&gt;, and all other comments come after 
it (since if one came before it, by definition, it wouldn't be first).


&gt;<i> Comments don't seem to quite fit as an &lt;aside&gt; or &lt;section&gt;
</I>
Why would they not fit in &lt;section&gt;? They're in the comments section.
