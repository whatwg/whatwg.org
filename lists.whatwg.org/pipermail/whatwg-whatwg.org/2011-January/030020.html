I do think that in the basic case of a user pressing play on a video
player, it's good to be able to make that respond instantly rather
than waiting for a round-trip to begin playing.

Another use case is the background of a game, where you want the video
ready to start when gameplay begins.

&gt;<i> Much work is needed to improve the buffering behavior of &lt;video&gt;, but mostly
</I>&gt;<i> it's an implementation issue at this point. I'm quite open to extensions to
</I>&gt;<i> the API, but we must be careful to not make assumptions about buffering

</I>&gt;<i> well when buffering is done in larger chunks using HTTP byte range requests
</I>&gt;<i> rather than some kind of TCP rate control.
</I>
This is why my approach doesn't give direct control over the buffer
size.  You can request that it be limited (preload=buffer) or
unlimited (preload=auto), but the exact buffer size is always up to
the browser.  The actual size should be abstract and not exposed to
scripts; in practice it's probably not even a single number but a
high- and low-watermark.
