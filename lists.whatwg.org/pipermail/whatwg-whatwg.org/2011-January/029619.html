Concepts like &quot;undo buffers&quot; are high level application behavior--that
doesn't belong in Canvas directly.  A &quot;discardable&quot; flag is the right
level of abstraction, though.

It's definitely not simple.  It also would be needed in many separate
APIs--Canvas, WebGL, ArrayBuffer, HTMLImageElement, and anything else
that can store large blocks of data (directly or indirectly).  I
started suggesting the same thing, but stopped since I don't see that
ever happening.

For what it's worth, Windows used to have an API to allocate
&quot;discardable&quot; memory, which could be deallocated under memory
pressure; it required locking and unlocking the memory, so when
unlocked the memory essentially operated as a weak reference that
could be deallocated as needed.  I think this was only supported in
Win16 (the GMEM_DISCARDABLE flag to GlobalAlloc); I mention it only
for reference.
