</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I'd prefer that, but it would require a good deal of metadata

</I>
Maybe you could enable them all by default and let users disable the ones  
they don't like?

&gt;<i> A much more realistic method would be to mark the transcription cues  
</I>&gt;<i> with a
</I>&gt;<i> class, and enabling and disabling them with CSS.
</I>
That would work too.

&gt;&gt;<i> (Also, we're not going to see &lt;video&gt;&lt;track&gt; used for anime fansubbing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the public Web until copyright terms are shortened to below the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> span of anime fans.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe so.  I don't know if professional subtitles ever do this.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> guessing (and hoping) not, but I'll ask around as a data point--they've
</I>&gt;<i> taken on other practices of fansubbers in the past.
</I>
That'd be valuable data to have, and something funny to look at :)

&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, the monospace Latin glyphs in most CJK look pretty bad. Still, if
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wants really fine-grained font control, it should already be possible
</I>&gt;<i> using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> webfonts and targeting specific glyphs with &lt;c.foo&gt;, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think you should need to resort to fine-grained font control to  
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable default fonts.  If you need to specify a font explicitly  
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> UAs choose incorrectly, something has gone wrong.  It doesn't help if  
</I>&gt;<i> things
</I>&gt;<i> are expected to work without CSS, either--I don't know how optional CSS
</I>&gt;<i> support is meant to be to WebVTT.
</I>
My main point here is that the use cases are so marginal. If there were  
more compelling ones, it's not hard to support intra-cue language settings  
using syntax like &lt;lang en&gt;bla&lt;/lang&gt; or similar.

&gt;<i> The above--semantics vs. presentation--brings something else to mind.   
</I>&gt;<i> One
</I>&gt;<i> of the harder things to subtitle well is when you have two conversations
</I>&gt;<i> talking on top of each other.  This is generally done by choosing a  
</I>&gt;<i> vertical
</I>&gt;<i> spot for each conversation (generally augmented with a color), so the  
</I>&gt;<i> viewer
</I>&gt;<i> can easily follow one or the other.  Setting the line position *sort of*
</I>&gt;<i> lets you do this, but that's hard to get right, since you don't know how  
</I>&gt;<i> far
</I>&gt;<i> apart to put them.  You'd have to err towards putting them too far apart
</I>&gt;<i> (guessing the maximum number of lines text might be wrapped to, and  
</I>&gt;<i> covering
</I>&gt;<i> up much more of the screen than usually needed), or putting one set on  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> top of the screen (making it completely impossible to read both at once,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than just challenging).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I remember correctly, SSA files do this with a hack: wherever there's  
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> blank spot in one or the other conversation, a transparent dummy cue is
</I>&gt;<i> added to keep the other conversation in the correct relative spot, so the
</I>&gt;<i> two conversations don't swap places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mention this because it comes to mind as something well-authored,
</I>&gt;<i> well-rendered subtitles need to get right, and I'm curious if there's a
</I>&gt;<i> reliable way to do this currently with WebVTT.  If this isn't handled,  
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> scenes just fall apart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As far as I'm aware no one has experimented with the rendering parts of  
WebVTT yet. It's defined in  
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/rendering.html#rules-for-updating-the-display-of-webvtt-text-tracks">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/rendering.html#rules-for-updating-the-display-of-webvtt-text-tracks</A>&gt;  
and is a little layout engine that tries to avoid overlapping.  
Implementing that and seeing what happens is the best way to find out if  
it's sane or not.

Do you have a working example of such a multi-conversation scene and how  
it should be rendered? That would be quite interesting to have a look at.
