There's only one way: have the server keep a copy. You have to do that 
anyway, since there's no guarantee the user will be using the same 
computer, let alone the same browser, the next time they visit.


&gt;<i> 2.  Kindly extend the specification so that other applications can make 
</I>&gt;<i> constructive use of localStorage.  Specifically, (a) establish a 
</I>&gt;<i> convention for associating keys with particular files (e.g., by 
</I>&gt;<i> prepending the file's path name to the key), and (b) allowing other 
</I>&gt;<i> applications to treat the file and its associated local storage as a 
</I>&gt;<i> single entity.  Doing this would allow a user to e-mail the current 
</I>&gt;<i> state of a file to a friend, so that both will have the same view of the 
</I>&gt;<i> file. This ability to share &quot;current&quot; views of a file is useful for 
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining HTML's role as a communications vehicle.
</I>
I expect we'll address this via the File System spec, if we do it.

They save time by not having to worry about it. :-)

Right.

So store it on the server when possible, but cache it locally. That's how 
the API is intended to work. In the rare case where a user changes 
computer (or changes browser), you just redownload the data.


&gt;<i> Security is another consideration.  Building experimental user-server 
</I>&gt;<i> exchange mechanisms isn't tolerated in my work environment, as you might 
</I>&gt;<i> imagine.  So if I can use localStorage to simulate server-side storage 
</I>&gt;<i> and build a proof-of-concept prototype that's entirely on the user's 
</I>&gt;<i> computer [i.e., mine], I have more opportunity to demo what I'm doing.
</I>
You don't have to have working cross-browser localStorage to do a demo 
prototype. Just fake it. :-)


&gt;<i> Following these ideas a little further, there's good reason to retain 
</I>&gt;<i> the user-side mechanisms in a production version, and just have the 
</I>&gt;<i> server check and sign user successes.
</I>
What happens when the user's machine catches fire? They lose their work? 
That seems suboptimal.


&gt;<i> As the server-side checks succeed, the user can migrate his results to 
</I>&gt;<i> other students or a professor, possibly via e-mail.  That's why I'd like 
</I>&gt;<i> to have localStorage implemented in an e-mail compatible fashion.  
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, the localStorage implementation would also be compatible with 
</I>&gt;<i> dropboxes.
</I>
It's not clear to me what you're asking for here.


&gt;<i> But you're right about maintaining state across multiple computers.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice to have a background mechanism for migrating student work 
</I>&gt;<i> from one student computer to another.
</I>
That's called the server. :-)
