</I>&gt;<i> sequence that allows you to conclude that &quot;fast&quot; requires the browser
</I>&gt;<i> to use the fastest.
</I>
Except that &quot;best effort&quot; has a tradition in meaning &quot;probably not the
best possible way and inexact&quot;, while &quot;fast&quot; would imply to people
that there is no faster way of doing it.



&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One question about inexact seeking is what should the client do when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the current playtime is closer to the requested time than what the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inexact seek would provide?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the case of &quot;fastest&quot;, the browser must then not do a seek. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case of &quot;don't care&quot;, it's up to the browser if it does the seek or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was my thinking, but I find the consistency point raised by Glenn
</I>&gt;<i> to be concerning.
</I>
If &quot;fast&quot; always means &quot;the fastest possible way&quot;, then it will be
consistent. It may mean that we need to specify it a bit more to be
consistent, but it would mean that. While &quot;default&quot; would be a best
effort and therefore cannot be expected to be consistent.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * KEYFRAME is keyframe-accurate seeking, so to the previous keyframe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What does this mean when a seekable stream doesn't have interior
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> keyframes? Should the client always seek to the beginning? Why is this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> valuable over a &quot;fast&quot; option?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where no keyframes are available, this seek option simply doesn't do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything, since obviously there are not keyframes. The point is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where this concept exists and people want to take advantage of it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this seek should be possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really feel that &quot;keyframe&quot; is far deeper into the codec internals
</I>&gt;<i> than should be or currently is provided by rest of the video API.
</I>&gt;<i> I've frequently seen content authors and application developers make
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect assumptions about key-frames: That they always indicate
</I>&gt;<i> scene changes, that they always occur at an exact interval, that two
</I>&gt;<i> differently encoded files will have the keyframes in the same places.
</I>&gt;<i> Etc. &#160;That these things are sometimes true feeds the mistaken
</I>&gt;<i> impressions. &#160;The frametypes inside a codec are really deep internals
</I>&gt;<i> that we ought not encourage people to mess with directly.
</I>

I could live with a seeking method without keyframe seeking. But frame
accurate seeking needs to be possible. So we end up with:
* default (&quot;best effort&quot;)
* TIME (or ACCURATE)
* FRAME
* FASTEST


&gt;<i> It seems surprising to me that we'd want to expose something so deeply
</I>&gt;<i> internal while the API fails to expose things like chapters and other
</I>&gt;<i> metadata which can actually be used to reliably map times to
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful high level information about the video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Chapters have an API:
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#dom-texttrack-kind-chapters">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#dom-texttrack-kind-chapters</A>
.

However, chapters don't have a seeking API - this is indeed something
to add, too. Could it fit within the seek() function? e.g.
seek(chaptername) instead of seek(time)?

Silvia.
