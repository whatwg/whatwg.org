 From a user's point of view it's really not.

Users don't clear their cache.

</I>
 From a user's perspective (which is what I'm speaking as here), it 
doesn't matter what the technology is.  The point is that there is 
prevalent UI out there right now where pausing a moving will keep 
buffering it up and then you can watch it later.  This is just as true 
for 2-hour movies as it is for 2-minute ones, last I checked.

So one question is whether this is a UI that we want to support, given 
existing user familiarity with it.  If so, there are separate questions 
about how to support it, of course.
