The main reason, IIRC, that we have disallowed &quot;--&quot; in comments in 
text/html is that they are disallowed in XML, and to help authors catch 
cases where they are commenting out comments.

The question, I guess, is which of the following do we think is more 
important:

 * Helping authors not write HTML markup that might be hard to convert to 
   XML, and helping authors avoid nesting comments accidentally, by 
   flagging &quot;--&quot; sequences in comments

 * Getting out of the way of authors who want to put &quot;--&quot; sequences in 
   comments, e.g. because they use &quot;--&quot; as a long dash (as I do all the 
   time!), or because they want to comment out punycoded URLs.

Currently the spec assumes the former is more important. Personally, I 
think the latter is rather more useful, but then I use &quot;--&quot; as long 
dashes all the time! When this was last studied, the weight of argument 
was on the stricter &quot;disallow --&quot; side of things, presumably.

I'm open to changing this back; does anyone else have an opinion on this?
