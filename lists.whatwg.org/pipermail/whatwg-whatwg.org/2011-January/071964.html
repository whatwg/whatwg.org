MITM is just one attack, and the solution is the easiest to define
(SSL), even if there are practical issues that should be improved.

Javascript injection is a harder problem, for example: it isn't
prevented by SSL, can persist without maintenance (unlike an MITM
attack), can be introduced untracably and without any special network
access (you don't need to &quot;get in the middle&quot;), and so in practice are
much more common than MITM attacks.

(Let's not get too caught up in how serious a geolocation attack is;
it's just one example, anyway.  The main thing that makes it
particularly notable is that it's actually a live, deployed API.)


&gt;<i> * If your cert expires or you misconfigure the site something else

</I>
It's bothered me for a long time that browsers treat self-signed
certificates as *less* secure than plaintext, which is nonsense.
Despite being vulnerable to MITM attacks, even an untrusted
certificate helps prevent passive sniffing attacks.  Browsers should
accept self-signed certificates and present them as an insecure
connection, as if they were simply HTTP, not show warnings.

As for revoked certificates, while they're a major red flag--they're a
category of certificate issues that *should* show large, scary
warnings--it's completely unacceptable for a browser to actually
*refuse* to allow the user to proceed.

By the way, another real-world issue with SSL is that it's
considerably more computationally expensive: handling encrypted
requests takes much more CPU, especially for high-bandwidth servers.
Not every service can afford to buy extra or more powerful servers to
handle this.
