Implementation details would not be defined by the spec.

Implementation fo the event type would be low-cost, backward compatible, 
and a simple entry to existing spec docs.
&quot;lowmemory&quot; does not need to mean that the OS is experiencing a low 
memory condition.

Here are some example implementations; it's up to the vendor, not the spec.

Tabbed browsing implementation:
Send a lowmemory event to hidden tabs listening (for lowmemory), that 
have not been visible for more than 60 seconds.
(This is a partial example, as it doesn't detail when the tabs would be 
checked for visibility. )

The example requires no OS mem-warnings and would allow use cases such 
as mine, to clean up a little, when lowmemory is fired.

Mobile implementation:
Mobile operating systems have lowmemory warnings, they are important for 
the durability of web apps running in mobile browsers.

&quot;Expensive&quot; implementation:
My mail client and web clients often compete with each other for memory: 
Mozilla apps drop image icons, WebKit crashes tabs.
After a few tabs are crashed, or a few icons are dropped, they could 
certainly send a lowmemory event to remaining listeners.
