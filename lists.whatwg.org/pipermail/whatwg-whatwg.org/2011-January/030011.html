Simple heuristics could solve this:

HTMLMediaElement.prototype.magicSeek = function(t) {
   if (Math.abs(t - this.currentTime) &lt; 10)
     this.seek(t, &quot;accurate&quot;);
   else
     this.seek(t, &quot;fast&quot;);
}

Or some refinement thereof...

</I>&gt;<i> default, is that if the media is seekable, it can always be seeked  
</I>&gt;<i> exactly, whereas media without an index may not be able to be seeked

</I>
Nitpick: If you can't seek approximately then simply not doing it would be  
fine, there's no requirement for a fast seek to always miss the target.

&gt;<i> We've already implemented frame accurate seeking in Firefox. I'd be

</I>&gt;<i> controls to use approximate seeking when seeking into unbuffered areas,  
</I>&gt;<i> but we wouldn't use approximate seeking when seeking into buffered  
</I>&gt;<i> areas. Videos are usually short enough that you want accuracy higher  
</I>&gt;<i> than keyframe granularity when seeking using the default controls (at  
</I>&gt;<i> least in buffered areas).
</I>
OK, having the feature is more important than the default.

Indeed.

</I>
Do we really need to make this feature testable? Why not just let them  
request fast seeking and give them what's possible?
