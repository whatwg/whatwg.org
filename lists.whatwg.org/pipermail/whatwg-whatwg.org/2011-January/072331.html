I don't see the point of that, if all it does is save one call to 
URL.createObjectURL() (and also one call to revokeObjectURL())?

In any case, making this behave differently than the URL API seems like 
a bad idea.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there actually a good reason for the URL API to have behave in this way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Adam's use case--to be able to download, play and cache audio data at 
the same time--seems like a pretty compelling one.  I think this is 
fundamentally an issue with the Blob API, not the URL API.  Blobs just 
seem like they ought to stream.  When you get a blob in the onprogress 
handler of an XHR2, you ought to be able to fire up a FileReader on it 
and have it automatically read from the blob as the XHR2 writes to the 
blob.  But currently (I think) you have to slice the blob to get only 
the new bytes and start a new FileReader each time onprogress is called. 
  (Or wait for onload, of course.)

Similarly, when you get your first onprogress event for a Blob download, 
you ought to be able to create a URL for that Blob that remains valid 
while the download is in progress.  So you can use that url with an 
audio element, for example.

Also: BlobBuilder seems to me as if it ought to be a streaming API.  It 
feels like it ought to work like this:

    var bb = new BlobBuilder();
    var b1 = bb.getBlob();
    var u1 = URL.createObjectURL(b1);
    bb.append(&quot;hello world&quot;);
    var b2 = bb.getBlob();
    var u2 = URL.createObjectURL(b2);
    b1 === b2   // They ought to be equal, but they're not
    u1 === u2   // Ought to be equal, but they're not
    bb.close(); // New method: now no more appends are allowed.

P.S. This is probably the wrong list for this discussion, isn't it?
