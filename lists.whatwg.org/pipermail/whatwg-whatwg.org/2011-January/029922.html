I checked with some other users who aren't me, as a sanity check, and 
while all of them expected pausing a movie to buffer far enough to be 
able to play through when unpaused, none of them really expected the 
whole movie to buffer.  So it might in fact make the most sense to stick 
to buffering when paused until we're in the playthrough state and then 
stop, and have some other UI for making the moving available offline.
