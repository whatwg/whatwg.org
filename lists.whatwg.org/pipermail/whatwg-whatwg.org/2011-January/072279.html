This is true. If you want fast frame accurate seeking, particularly over 
the internet, it's best to not encode with such a large keyframe 
interval. This is a problem caused by a webdev's inappropriate encoding 
choice, not by a bad API choice.

If seeking is slow when you encode with a large keyframe interval, don't 
encode with a large keyframe interval!

What if the browser's controls by default seeked to the previous 
keyframe, if the user had enough precision in the controls and wanted to 
seek to 9 seconds after a keyframe (1 second before the subsequent 
keyframe), then they could not.

I disagree. The default should be exact, with &quot;approximate&quot; seeking to 
the nearest keyframe.  When you call video.seek(X.xx), you've specified 
an exact time, and would likely expect an exact time, so the media 
should seek to that exact time. Another reason to make exact the 
default, is that if the media is seekable, it can always be seeked 
exactly, whereas media without an index may not be able to be seeked 
approximately.

We've already implemented frame accurate seeking in Firefox. I'd be 
happy for us to implement approximate seeking, it would be useful for 
seeking into areas of the media which are unbuffered. We may change our 
controls to use approximate seeking when seeking into unbuffered areas, 
but we wouldn't use approximate seeking when seeking into buffered 
areas. Videos are usually short enough that you want accuracy higher 
than keyframe granularity when seeking using the default controls (at 
least in buffered areas).

We should specify the default, otherwise by default webdevs will always 
need to specify their seek accuracy level.

</I>
Some media format's index for audio as well, so where there are no 
keyframes, you could seek to the nearest indexed point from the index. 
Or (probably a better idea) have some way of reporting whether keyframe 
level approximate seeking is available.

Exact seeking is always available if the media is seekable (so it makes 
a good default...), and script can determine whether faster but 
approximate seeking is available and can choose to use it.

I don't think there's much (or any?) demand for seeking in anything 
other than seconds?

&gt;<i> So maybe just let the flag be default and nothing else, but as

We can always add it later if demand arises. HTML is a living standard 
right? ;)

Seeks would only be &quot;slow&quot; in the case where keyframes were infrequent. 
In many cases a &quot;snap to keyframe&quot; seek would be inaccurate enough to be 
annoying with infrequent keyframes. I can only imagine the bugs we'll 
get filed if we make it the default!
