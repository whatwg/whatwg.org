If you don't have enough bandwidth, then the necessary buffer size is
effectively the entire video[1].  Mikko seems to suggest that it's the
entire video times some multiplier, where that multiplier can be discovered
by binary searching.  This doesn't make sense to me:

&gt;<i> static time period in seconds. This is required because a 5 second

[1] (Of course, it's more precisely the size of the video minus a function
of the video size, bitrate and user bandwidth--the amount of data you can
leave unbuffered at the end and have it finish while you're watching.  I
point this out because someone else will if I don't, but I don't think it's
relevant to any buffer size algorithm: it's hard to determine, and if you
get it wrong for a long video you have a very annoyed user with his movie
interrupted two hours in.)
