Firefox caches media data locally on disk, and will evict data which is 
unlikely to be needed in future when its cache gets full. There's no way 
for users to force eviction, except by manually reducing the size of the 
media cache by changing a pref.

This sounds like either the server you're serving your media from isn't 
configured to enable seeking in your media (usually because it's serving 
content gzipped, or because it doesn't correctly support or advertise 
that it supports HTTP1.1 byte range requests) or whatever browser you're 
using hasn't implemented seeking using HTTP1.1 byte ranges yet.
