It's not a big problem, but a user experience one: user interfaces are
cleaner when they're immediately responsive.  I'd sooner give a crisp
interface to users than one that feels delayed.

&gt;&gt;<i> Another use case is the background of a game, where you want the video

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For that you should really use &lt;audio preload=auto&gt;, no?
</I>
Not if all you want is for the video to start with the rest of the game, and
not to download the whole video.

They're both minor, of course; helpful side-effects of preload=buffer, not
sufficient justifications by themselves.


Hmm.  To get this effect without preload=buffer, you could set preload=auto,
watch the buffered attribute to see when some data is actually downloaded,
then set it to preload=metadata to stop autoloading.  That's a minor hack,
and would need to watch out for browsers that don't autoload on
preload=auto, but it's probably good enough for the above cases.  It'd only
work if runtime changes to preload are applied, which would also be needed
for scripts to implement &quot;preload=auto only when paused&quot;.
