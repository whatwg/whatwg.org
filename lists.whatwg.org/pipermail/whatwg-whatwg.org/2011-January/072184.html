Hmm... it's certainly a necessary condition, but is it sufficient?

Probably if we ever end up in a buffering state (i.e.
networkState=NETWORK_LOADING and readyState=HAVE_CURRENT_DATA or less)
then we should increase the downloadBufferTarget or completely drop
it, since we weren't able to get data from the network fast enough to
continue feeding the decoding buffer. Even if after that we return to
readyState=HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA, it's probably just a matter of time
before we again have to go into buffering state.

Maybe it's more correct to say that we honour the downloadBufferTarget
only when the readyState is *always* HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA during playback?

Cheers,
Silvia.
