&gt;<i> Two ideas just struck me:

</I>&gt;<i> What if, instead of trying to solve this problem, we leave it up to

This is a lot to push onto developers; the browser should be handling this.
If it's too hard for browsers to get right, then it's going to be even
harder to get it right from Javascript.

== User Behavior ==
&gt;<i> We might also consider leaning on users a bit to tell us what they
</I>&gt;<i> want. For example, I think people are pretty used to hitting play and
</I>&gt;<i> then pause to buffer until the end of the video. What if we just used
</I>&gt;<i> our bandwidth heuristics while in the play state, and buffered blindly
</I>&gt;<i> when a pause occurs less than X seconds into a video? I won't argue
</I>&gt;<i> that this is a wonderful solution (or a habit we should encourage),
</I>&gt;<i> but I figured I'd throw a random idea out there&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My first impression is that this is strange, but my second is that it may be
the only way available.  In particular, we need to know *when* we're short
on bandwidth, and thus need to pause and download most of the video before
continuing.  I don't think any auto-detection mechanism will be reliable,
and having the user tell us makes sense, but regular users won't understand
a context menu &quot;[x] preload whole video&quot;.  Doing a full preload when paused
seems discoverable--after all, that's exactly what users do on YouTube when
a video isn't buffering fast enough.

However, I think this should be implemented by scripts, not the browser.  If
a downloadBufferTarget property is exposed, that's easy to do: when the user
pauses, set downloadBufferTarget to its &quot;unlimited&quot; value, and set it back
when the video is unpaused.

The reason for this is interactions with other features.  For example, a
video may default to being paused; that shouldn't disable prebuffer limits.
Also, video players often leave the video paused if the tab is loaded in the
background, so open-in-background-tab and browser session restoring don't
cause videos to start playing[1].  (www.ted.com does this.)  This shouldn't
have the side-effect of removing preload limits.  If it's controlled by
scripts, these interactions can be managed properly.



[1] I'm not sure if this is actually possible right now, and it's
important--there's little more annoying than loading a browser session and
having a video start playing somewhere.  This is probably a significant use
case for the &quot;tab visibility&quot; proposal.
