What if my bandwidth situation improves (moving from 3g to WiFi, for example)?
At that point, perhaps I should go from auto to invoked?

</I>
Would the read-ahead buffer length be a configurable property?

== New Proposal ==

Based on the feedback we've gotten, I'd like to propose the following:
* Adding an additional preload state between metadata and auto (I'll
call it state3, but we should name it &quot;invoked&quot; or &quot;buffer&quot;)
* Adding the &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; property, which can be updated at any time

=== Use cases ===

==== Starting with preload = none / meta ====

* Once the user has indicated they want to play a video, the browser
  will go into state3 and buffer at least &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds
  of video before playing
* Once in state3, the browser will attempt to maintain a buffer of
  approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds, regardless of state
* If the browser cannot maintain a buffer of length
  &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;, it will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;
* If preload is later set back to state3, the browser will:
  &gt; If the buffer &gt;= &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds:
   - The browser will play through the current buffer surplus until it
     has approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds in the buffer
   - Once the surplus has been used, the browser will attempt to
     maintain a buffer of approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;
     seconds
   - If the browser cannot maintain a buffer of length
     &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;, it will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;
 &gt; If the buffer &lt; &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds:
   - The browser will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;

==== Starting with preload = state3 ====

* On page load, the browser will go into state3 and buffer at least
  &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds of video before playing
* Once the user has indicated they want to play a video, the browser
  will attempt to maintain a buffer of approximately
  &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds, regardless of state
* If the browser cannot maintain a buffer of length
  &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;, it will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;
* If preload is later set back to state3, the browser will:
  &gt; If the buffer &gt;= &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds:
   - The browser will play through the current buffer surplus until it
     has approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds in the buffer
   - Once the surplus has been used, the browser will attempt to
     maintain a buffer of approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;
     seconds
   - If the browser cannot maintain a buffer of length
     &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;, it will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;
 &gt; If the buffer &lt; &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds:
   - The browser will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;

==== Starting with preload = auto ====

* On page load, the browser will go into auto and buffer as much video
  as possible
* If preload is later set to state3, the browser will:
  &gt; If the buffer &gt;= &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds:
   - The browser will play through the current buffer surplus until it
     has approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds in the buffer
   - Once the surplus has been used, the browser will attempt to
     maintain a buffer of approximately &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;
     seconds
   - If the browser cannot maintain a buffer of length
     &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot;, it will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;
 &gt; If the buffer &lt; &quot;downloadTargetBuffer&quot; seconds:
   - The browser will set preload = &quot;auto&quot;

Zach
