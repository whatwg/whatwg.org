</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the page, so I don't think it makes sense to give the page's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; origin.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sounds like an implementer would not include a Referer header, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; either.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Possibly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this something we want to leave undefined? As the &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> widget typically routes directly to OS-level file management, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think there's a simple solution to bringing more control to the browser.
</I>
I don't really see anything wrong with leaving this undefined; it's just a 
user feature, not something the Web page can have any control over.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Continuing on with tweaking URLs to work with with the File API:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Chrome has gone ahead with their setData proposal, enhancing the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; event.dataTransfer object so that users may drag a file from within 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the browser onto their desktop.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The extension uses setData with a key of DownloadURL and a value 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; including a mime type, file descriptor and URI.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'd like this interface to work within ondrop; if 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; getData(DownloadURL) is set, then a FileList would be returned in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; event.dataTransfer.files, much like it is when users drag files from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their desktop into the browser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This would of course require Origin checks; whereas dragging onto 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the desktop does not require an Origin check.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not quite sure I follow what you are proposing. However, in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; future version of this API we should definitely add a &quot;promise&quot;-like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature that lets you specify drag data without having it already 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downloaded, so that when the user drops the data somewhere, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser can then ask the JS for the data. I'm not sure using 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setData('DownloadURL') is a good way to do it; that just seems to add 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more hacks to an already pretty hacky API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The DataTransferItem proposal is heading in this direction. Currently, a 
</I>&gt;<i> file collection &quot;.files&quot;, works with the File API and XmlHttpRequest. 
</I>&gt;<i> Drag+drop from the desktop returns file objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm proposing we explore methods to enable drag+drop from within the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser to return file objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The FileSystem API is a resource: we can now build a file from within 
</I>&gt;<i> standard APIs. Until that point, we could only use the BlobBuilder 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal DataTransferItem.add(fileData) pretty much takes care of 
</I>&gt;<i> the request (when used with a working/complete FileSystem API).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We still need a promise-like feature, as you've pointed out.
</I>
This all seems reasonable at a high level, but it's probably too early to 
start adding this kind of feature today. I've noted things along the lines 
of what you describe in the spec as possible &quot;v2&quot; material.


&gt;<i> On a side note -- I've been having a lot of issue with building blobs:
</I>
For blob issues, public-webapps is probably more appropriate as that is 
where the File API specs are being discussed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently the new DataTransferItems API doesn't enforce the limit of

</I>&gt;<i> What happens if a page were to add multiple string items of &quot;text/plain&quot;?

</I>&gt;<i> (If/when Blob support is added, the same comments generally apply)
</I>
Ok, I've limited the API to only one &quot;string&quot; item per type.

I think it's probably a little early given that no implementation has yet 
implemented the DataTransforItems object (as far as I know).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * I am worried about the effectAllowed attribute. Needless to say 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that the number of value is exponencially proportional to the number 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of possible values for the dropEffect attribute. Wouldn't it be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; better to have a linear number of booleans ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but it's about 10 years too late to change that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This section should (and is?) be kept up with WAI-ARIA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The concept here, of effectAllowed, is semantic, much like HTML. If your 
</I>&gt;<i> use-case doesn't fit the minimal vocabulary, you can use your own cursor 
</I>&gt;<i> and other visualizations. Even in that case, you should still include 
</I>&gt;<i> some amount of semantic data about the possible drop event.
</I>
I don't follow.

The spec does sort of nod in this direction:

# If the drag initiated outside of the application, the user agent must 
# add items to the drag data store item list as appropriate for the data 
# being dragged, honoring platform conventions where appropriate [...]

...however, it's rather underdefined at the moment, lacking implementation 
experience. I expect we'll flesh this out in due course.

As far as I can tell it didn't mention them before either. Am I missing 
something? Why would it mention them?


&gt;<i> - Does the casing of &quot;Text&quot; and &quot;URL&quot; in the return value of

</I>
It can't ever return those values, whatever the case, as far as I can 
tell.
