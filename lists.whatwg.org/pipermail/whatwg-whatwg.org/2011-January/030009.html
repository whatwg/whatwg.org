</I>
Most Ogg media out there has a keyframe interval of 2 seconds, which 
seems reasonable to me.

With *indexed* Ogg media, when seeking into unbuffered ranges, the seek 
usually completes within 2-4 seconds. This is comparable speed to 
seeking into unbuffered media on YouTube's Flash video. Were I live in 
the world it is anyway.

People don't seek very often when playing media. It doesn't seem 
unreasonable to wait *a few* seconds for a seek into an unbuffered range 
to complete.

With non-indexed Ogg media where you must perform a bisection search 
over HTTP, performance will obviously be slower, but that's why we 
developed the Ogg index in the first place. Perhaps your comparing 
Firefox's performance to Cortado on non-indexed media?

</I>
The seek precision in those players you list is limited by the input 
mechanism; their GUI seek bars. Whereas we're (re)specifying an API 
which accepts a more precise floating point number.

There's nothing stopping the various browsers using the approximate seek 
mechanism in their controls.
