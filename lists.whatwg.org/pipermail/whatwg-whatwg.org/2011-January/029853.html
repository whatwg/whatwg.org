</I>
In simple event systems that's mostly a matter of running the event
loop until nothing more happens, but I'm sure it's very complicated
with a production browser.

Ultimately, the right solution is to do all work like this in workers
anyway--but it'll be a long time, if ever, before we can fully do so
(eg. real canvas and WebGL access).

&gt;&gt;<i> You don't need any trickery to get the latter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;trickery&quot; here.
</I>
Timing threads to achieve smaller timers than 10ms on Windows, as you
mentioned Chrome does.

&gt;<i> I oversimplified the spec a bit, for simplicity, because the main issue is
</I>&gt;<i> in fact the clamped timers and what to clamp to and how to do it. The spec
</I>&gt;<i> specifies a heuristic to use in just such a way, in fact. &#160;I suggest you
</I>&gt;<i> just read it if you're interested in the details....
</I>
I have; it allows UAs to clamp longer, but doesn't permit browsers to
allow nested timeouts of less than 4ms, even if they design a
heuristic that allows doing so safely.

&gt;<i> timeouts in workers are... weird as currently specced. &#160;Not only do they
</I>&gt;<i> have the 4ms floor for nested timeouts, but they're not specced in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> wall-clock time but rather in terms of time during which the worker is not
</I>&gt;<i> suspended.
</I>
That's odd, indeed.  This seems likely to force people who want
30-second timers into setting 1-second timers and checking the time
manually.  That's (mildly) wasteful, and easy to get wrong if the
system clock changes (though I guess browsers don't actually handle
that well, either).

&gt;&gt;<i> For code that renders an entire scene at a time and displays it (most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> typical double-buffered OpenGL-like rendering), this might be useful,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'm not sure it helps here. &#160;He's incrementally rendering the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result, so he needs to keep a copy of it to continue rendering the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scene.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who's incrementally rendering what?
</I>
<A HREF="http://skypher.com/SkyLined/demo/FractalZoomer/Mandel.html,">http://skypher.com/SkyLined/demo/FractalZoomer/Mandel.html,</A> linked earlier.

&gt;<i> The idea with the forgets approach would be that you have an imagedata
</I>&gt;<i> object. &#160;You pass it to the worker, the worker modifies it and passes it
</I>&gt;<i> back. &#160;The only constraint is that you can't touch the object while the
</I>&gt;<i> worker is modifying it. &#160;That seems like a pretty common use case. &#160;Are we
</I>&gt;<i> talking about some other use case here?
</I>
I agree that's probably useful, and frame-by-frame rendering is much
more common than incremental rendering.

&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect there's something simpler going on here, though--as you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said, copying a 10 MB buffer really should be very quick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really not that quick, actually. &#160;First, you have to allocate a new
</I>&gt;<i> 10MB buffer. &#160;Then you have to memcpy into it. &#160;Then you have to free it at
</I>&gt;<i> some point. &#160;I just wrote a simple test C program that has a single 10MB
</I>&gt;<i> array initialized and then in a loop allocates a 10MB array, memcpys into
</I>&gt;<i> it, and then frees the 10MB allocation it just made. &#160;It takes about 5ms per
</I>&gt;<i> loop iteration to run on my system (fairly high-end laptop that was new in
</I>&gt;<i> July 2010). &#160;The time is split about 50-50 between the allocation and the
</I>&gt;<i> memcpy.
</I>
It might be possible to optimize the allocation further, but even
2.5ms is worth optimizing out.  If you're trying to maintain 60 FPS
(16.6ms per frame), that's 15% of your total available time (ignoring
concurrency).
