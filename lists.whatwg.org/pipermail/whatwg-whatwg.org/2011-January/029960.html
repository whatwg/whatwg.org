&gt;<i> 1. Throttle at the TCP level by not reading data from the socket (not at

You're talking about Opera's implementation and not in spec, right?  This is
something UA's should have a lot of freedom with, and I assume this
low-level detail about how to use HTTP is out of scope for the HTML spec.


&gt;<i> (Since there is some overhead with each HTTP request, one must make sure
</I>&gt;<i> that they are not unreasonably small.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When HTTP byte ranges are used to achieve bandwidth management, it's hard
</I>&gt;<i> to talk about a single downloadBufferTarget that is the number of seconds
</I>&gt;<i> buffered ahead. Rather, there might be an upper and lower limit within which
</I>&gt;<i> the browser tries to stay, so that each request can be of a reasonable size.
</I>&gt;<i> Neither an author-provided minumum or maximum value can be followed
</I>&gt;<i> particularly closely, but could possibly be taken as a hint of some sort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Does it actually make sense to specify the read-ahead size, or should it
simply be a flag (eg. &quot;unlimited&quot;, &quot;small buffer&quot; and &quot;don't care&quot;)?  Is
there really a case for setting the actual read-ahead value directly?  In a
sense, that seems akin to allowing web pages to control the TCP buffer sizes
used by the client's browser--it's lower level than people usually care
about.

In particular, I'm thinking that most of the time all people care about is
&quot;read ahead a little&quot; vs. &quot;read ahead a lot&quot;, and publishers shouldn't need
to figure out the right buffer size to use for the former (and very likely
getting it wrong).
