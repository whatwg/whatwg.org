<PRE>I couldn't agree more that we should avoid turning this into vista's UAC.

Maybe developers could make changes infrequent enough that users
wouldn't be bothered very often? They could encapsulate the device
access logic into one .js file that shouldn't be regularly changed.

Another option is to set default security to list changes to scripts
with device access in the device access preferences pane. Allow a
higher security setting that would send alert popups to notify
changes.

You could also use a third party CA like entity to verify your scripts
(this option would naturally have to develop over time).
