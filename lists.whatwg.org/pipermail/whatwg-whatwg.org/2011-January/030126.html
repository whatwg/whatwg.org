<PRE>Just to start the discussion, we put together the simplest use case you can imagine (with an additional error case). It has been been sent to the RTC-Web community before, but as there is some discussion on ConnectionPeer ongoing we thought the use case could be of interest in this community as well. 

Some requirements are derived from the use case. The intention is to add more use cases, but before spending any more energy I though it would be good to display it to start the discussion and to get feedback on whether this is a workable model or not.
 
The requirements are split in three categories: 
1. User/privacy: the intention is to list what an end user can expect in
   terms of what an web application can do without user consent and so on
2. API dimension: lists what must be accessible by JS and signalled to JS
   via APIs
3. Functional dimension: lists functionality that must be supported by the
   browser (in combination with the underlying operating system, drivers 
   and HW) even though it is not visible from the API. 
 
I can't say that I am extremely satisfied with this division. Perhaps we could come up with something better. Also, some of the requirements in the User/privacy and Functional dimensions are not derived (e.g. ask for user
consent) from this use case per se, but are instead generic requirements.
Perhaps they should be handled separately?

&quot;Connection&quot; is not mentioned as it is not a requirement (the requirement is rather to be able to send and receive streams, a connection would presumably be used as a foundation for the stream transport).
 
OK, to the use case:

====================
1. Simple Video Chat
====================
A simple video chat service has been developed. In the service the users are logged on to the same chat web server. The web server publishes information about user login status, pushing updates to the web apps in the browsers. By clicking on an online peer user name, a 1-1 video chat session between the two browsers is initiated. The invited peer is presented with a choice of joining or rejecting the session.
 
The web author developing the application has decided to display a self-view as well as the video from the remote side in rather small windows, but the user can change the display size during the session. The application also supports if a participant (for a longer or shorter time) would like to stop sending audio (but keep video) or video (keep audio) to the other peer (&quot;mute&quot;).
 
Any of the two participants can at any time end the chat by clicking a button.
 
In this specific case two users are using lap-tops in their respective homes. They are connected to the public Internet with a desktop browser using WiFi behind NATs. One of the users has an ADSL connection to the home, and the other fiber access. Most of the time headsets are used, but not always.

2 Simple video chat with link loss
==================================
The use case is identical to the previous one, but in this case the ADSL link is unreliable and goes down from time to time.

2.1 Requirements
----------------
Only the delta is documented (the other reqs remain).

2.1.1 User/privacy dimension

!has been dropped                       !                                      !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!The web application must be made aware !To be able to inform user and take    !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	 
2.1.3 Functional dimension
--------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!Requirement.                           !Comment                               !
