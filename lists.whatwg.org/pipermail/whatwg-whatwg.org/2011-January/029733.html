The basic idea behind this design is that type=radio seems to have been 
designed to keep each control as independent as possible -- before we 
started fiddling with it in WF2, the only way type=radio controls had any 
relationship to other type=radio controls was with their behaviour when 
they were clicked. Now, for required=&quot;&quot;, we needed a little more than 
that, because otherwise required=&quot;&quot; was essentially useless for radio 
buttons, but I tried to be faithful to the original design and kept it as 
independent as possible.


&gt;<i> I'm thinking of implementing that for Gecko 2.0/Firefox 4 so I would 
</I>&gt;<i> like to know if you know any reason that would make the current behavior 
</I>&gt;<i> more appropriate than the one described here.
</I>
In the end I'll spec whatever gets implemented. What do other browser 
vendors feel about this? Should we make required=&quot;&quot; on any one type=radio 
control affect the validity of all the other controls? Or should we stick 
to the independent basis of this API?
