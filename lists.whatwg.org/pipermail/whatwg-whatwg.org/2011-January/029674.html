HTTPS already prevents MITM attacks and most others; the major attack
vector they don't prevent is a compromised server.

I thnik the main difference is that the private keys needed to sign
with HTTPS are normally located on the server delivering the scripts,
whereas signed updates can keep their private keys offline.  That's
not a model web apps can mimic: all ways to execute scripts, in both
Javascript files and inline in HTML, would need to be signed, which is
impossible with templated HTML.

&gt;<i> Perhaps we need infrastructure like that for websites; I'm not quite sure

</I>
You don't really know that an installer you download from a server is
valid, either.  Most of the time--for most users and most
software--you have to take it on faith that the file on the server
hasn't been compromised.  But, yes, you only have to do that once with
auto-updating systems, not on every update.
