<PRE>
This thread led me to realise there were a number of problems in the spec 
with the multiple=&quot;&quot; attribute as applied to type=email, including a poor 
definition of how list=&quot;&quot; applies, a poor definition of how selectedOption 
applies, an incoherent expectation that the selection API should apply to 
type=email at all (which doesn't work since the UI is supposed to be 
IDN-based but the output and the API isn't), and various complication 
regarding how values are to be checked, depite the recent fixes in that 
area. I revamped how it was specced and hopefully it makes more sense now.

</I>
I've changed the spec so that it decouples the underlying DOM and 
submission value from the UI, so that's no longer an issue.


&gt;<i> You can found an example of that kind of UI in GMail.
</I>
The GMail To:/Cc: controls are rather different than the type=email and 
type=email/multiple controls. For example, their output value includes 
names, not just e-mail addresses. If we want to support that use case, 
that's likely an entirely different control, not type=email. For example, 
we'd want to add an API to hook into the autocompletion, we'd want an 
expectation of a multiline UI, we'd probably want individual values to be 
manipulatable using drag-and-drop, etc. I think that's something we should 
probably not try to address at this stage, where we're still trying to get 
basics like date controls sorted out.

list=&quot;&quot; as previously defined didn't make any sense for type=email/ 
multiple; I've fixed it to operate on the individual values and not on the 
whole string.

Indeed. Fixed.

Indeed. Also fixed.

Yes, I expect we'll add a valueAsList feature at some point.

Not for this control, no.

That's certainly an allowable UI (now). I don't think it oblivates the 
need for a control that lets authors provide e-mail addresses with names 
that the server then receives, but that's another story, as discussed 
above.

</I>
The single e-mail use case is indeed what you describe. The multiple 
e-mail use case wasn't very well thought through, I think. I don't think 
it makes sense to have type=email and type=email/multiple have different 
concepts of &quot;email&quot;, though. If there aren't good use cases for the 
multiple e-mail address case, I think we're better off dropping support 
for multiple=&quot;&quot; from this type, and revisiting it in the future.
