No, not really.  Something that _matches_ selectors an be tied to a 
property via seeing which selectors it matches and then considering the 
resulting declaration lists....

</I>
So rules for matching selectors to selectors, right?  Defining these 
could really get pretty complex, unless you're suggesting that it just 
be a string compare of the serializations or something.

&gt;&gt;<i> You can do that right now using getComputedStyle, with a bit more

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, or by iterating through document.stylesheets.
</I>
Um... why would you do that?

&gt;<i> But as Ashley pointed out, it is needlessly complex to create one's own pseudo document
</I>
Why would you need to create a pseudo document?

&gt;<i> for this purpose, and I think it should be a simple operation to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> do something as fundamental as following best practices.
</I>
Ideally, yes, but setting styles directly from script (as opposed to 
setting classes that are then styled by the stylesheet) is not exactly 
&quot;best practices&quot;, unless we're looking at different best practices lists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or, for canvas specifically. You draw an animated &quot;Hello&quot; and want the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> designer to be able to choose the fill color. You want to be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> query the stylesheet easily to get the styling info.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or just set a class on your canvas and let styles apply to it as normal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you are thinking of SVG here?
</I>
No, I'm not.  Per the canvas spec, if I read it right, doing this:

   myCanvas.className = &quot;somethingStyled&quot;;
   myCanvas.fillStyle = &quot;currentColor&quot;;

should set the fill style to the computed value of &quot;color&quot; on myCanvas 
(and in particular, to whatever that computed value is given the class 
&quot;somethingStyled&quot;).  As it happens, Gecko doesn't implement this yet, 
but the spec says to do it.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#dom-context-2d-canvas">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#dom-context-2d-canvas</A> 
paragraph starting &quot;Whenever the CSS value currentColor&quot;.

&gt;<i> ..and even if one could, it would not be targeted to the specific shapes
</I>&gt;<i> needing styling.
</I>
Canvas isn't retained-mode.  So you set your fill style, then draw the 
shapes that need to have that style.  If you want a different style for 
different shapes, you set the new fill style and draw those shapes. 
There's no magic targeting involved...
