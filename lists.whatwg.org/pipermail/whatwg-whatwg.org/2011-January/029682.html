Using a syntax that can be escaped with &gt; and &lt; avoids needing
to add additional escapes, though at the cost of an unusual comment
syntax.  Off the top of my head, &lt;! ... !&gt; resembles HTML comments
enough to be fairly obvious.

// comments would mean URLs in captions would require escaping.  Most
formats that use that style of comments are programming languages,
which don't have loose URLs outside of strings.

&gt;<i> The question is rather if the comments should be exposed as DOM comment
</I>&gt;<i> nodes in getCueAsHTML, which seems to be what you're asking for. That would
</I>&gt;<i> only be possible if comments were only allowed inside the cue text, which
</I>&gt;<i> means that you couldn't comment out entire cues, as such:
</I>
I don't think getCueAsHTML helps an editor (since it's one-way); an
editor will probably need to have its own parser, which isn't a big
deal.  As long as there's support for comments in the file format, so
people don't need to make up a &quot;working&quot; file format just to add them,
that's enough; such a parser can handle comments however it wants.

&gt;<i> Therefore, my thinking is that comments should be removed during parsing and
</I>&gt;<i> not be exposed to any layer above it.

That's fine.
