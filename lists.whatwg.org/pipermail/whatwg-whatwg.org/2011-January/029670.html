I haven't added these features to the spec for now, since the use cases 
for it aren't that compelling and so it's probably best to wait a while 
longer, allowing browser vendors to implement more of the stuff we have 
already added.

That doesn't really look like a Web spec... it doesn't really address 
privacy and security concerns (it just says browsers &quot;must not retrieve 
or update system information to Web sites without the express permission 
of the user&quot;, which doesn't really give much of a chance for there to be 
a good user interface for this), and it's massively over-engineered for 
what it is (the API surface is bigger than &lt;canvas&gt;!).

It looks more like something one would use in walled-garden environments.

Indeed.

I think we're some way away from having many users run background Web apps 
on their mobile devices for this kind of thing! However, in the future 
this may become more realistic and that would be a good time to spec this.
