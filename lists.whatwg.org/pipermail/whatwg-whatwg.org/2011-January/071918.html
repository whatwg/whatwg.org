True but in case of character devices which continuously send a string
of max 1Kb (or less) this is not a blocking factor.

I agree that having a full set of API to handle b/c devices would be
everybody dream but we all know we have to work around some
limitations, it has always been so.

Polling for changes was enough to get the results but some sort of
mutation events would have worked better (depending on device output).

Currently the GPS device I am using only output text but it could as

</I>
Setting the device serial configuration can be done outside the
browser (until a proper specification and API exists). Maybe having
those settings in the &quot;about:config&quot; would allow access more easily to
those not willing to open the terminal.

Adding strong security will not diminish the importance of having
these capabilities in new OS centric browsers.

</I>
Yeah, maybe. However if you had payed attention to the discussion I am
just testing :)

I repeatedly stated that I am OK with current level of security and I
wish better and more secure methods are found and implemented (if
needed).

I added that I agree with the proposal to find alternatives that will
allow to make easy for browsers to communicate with RS232/USB devices
securely.

&gt;&gt;<i> So next question is why allow Adobe Flash and plug-ins in general to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do that wildly and not allow others to have the same capability and be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so paranoid about security when that is already broken by other means

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Flash is insecure, so HTML5 should be too?  Seriously?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please read it again I only asked &quot;why&quot; ?

I said Flash is insecure yes, the rest are your words (purposely
misinterpreted)...

HTML5 should be secure but I am not sure allowing it to run side by
side with insecure (and evil) content makes that a reality :-)

The &quot;Device element&quot; proposal and the parts on security that Seth put
forth in previous messages seemed a good start to me, that's all.

Have fun,
