</I>&gt;<i> If we could agree, then of course it should be documented somewhere, even if it seems somewhat restrictive of the spec to mandate an exact behavior.
</I>
Perhaps the conservative buffering strategy should be client-side throttling after all. The pause-to-buffer argument several people put forward is a strong one - a big use case (perhaps more people pause b/c of this than b/c of all other reasons combined). Something like a downloadBufferTarget would be confusing and break this. Client-side throttling won't.
