I think that's indeed one obvious improvement, i.e. when going to
pause stat, stop buffering when readyState=HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA (i.e. we
have reached canplaythrough state).

However, again, I don't think that's sufficient. Because we will also
buffer during playback and it is possible that we buffer fast enough
to have buffered e.g. the whole of a 10min video by the time we hit
pause after 1 min and stop watching. That's far beyond canplaythrough
and that's 9min worth of video download wasted bandwidth. This is
where the suggested downloadBufferTarget would make sense. It would
basically specify how much more to download beyond HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA
before pausing the download.

Cheers,
Silvia.
