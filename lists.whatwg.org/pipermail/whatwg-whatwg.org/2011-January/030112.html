<PRE>Hi all,

 

I've submitted the following bug to Chrome &amp; Opera browsers:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=70778">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=70778</A> 

And it was closed as won't fix because the behavior is expected. I think it
should be changed. A brief description of the problem is that when the video
tag has embedded browser controls displayed and I click anywhere on the
controls, they cause a video tag click event. If I want to toggle play/pause
on video area click, then I cannot do this, because clicking on the play
control button, fires play, then click event fires for video tag and when I
toggle It pauses. So this behavior that every popular flash player has
cannot be achieved. There is no way to understand that the click.target is
the embedded browser controls area. I think that a nice improvement will be
to expose this information, in the target, that it actually is embedded
browser controls. Or clicking the embedded browser controls should not
produce a click event for video tag. After all browser controls are native
and do not have representation in the DOM. Let me know what do you think
about this?

 

Another thing that I see as a limitation is that video should expose API for
currentFrame, so that when control developers want to add support for
subtitles on their own, to be able to support formats that display the
subtitles according to the current video frame. This is a limitation to the
current design of the video tag.

 

Thanks,

Lubomir Toshev
