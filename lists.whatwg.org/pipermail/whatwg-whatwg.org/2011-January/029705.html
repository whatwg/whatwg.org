</I>
That's a very odd set of requirements. Can you tell us more about the use 
case? (Are there any controls in native OSes that operate that way?)

Browsers are allowed to let authors enter out-of-range numbers; indeed one 
can imagine situations where the default value might be out of range (e.g. 
a form saying &quot;your previous choice is no longer valid, select a new 
value&quot; when some business logic constraints change). However, the UA is 
indeed required to make sure the value is always numeric (or the empty 
string).

</I>&gt;<i> to build such a widget, ideally in combination with &lt;input type=number&gt;.
</I>
Indeed, without knowing more of the use case it's hard to say one way or 
the other.

Either behaviour is allowed. That's mostly a quality-of-implementation 
issue.


&gt;<i> The spec is trying to say as little as possible about UI here, so that

</I>&gt;<i> the conventions can be added to the spec at that point.
</I>
Indeed.

I don't see how it could break scripts at this stage, since it's still 
very early days.


&gt;<i> The input event is not guaranteed to be fired on every keystroke anyway 
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
The 'input' event only fires when the underlying /value/ changes, per 
spec, so if the UA isn't updating the underlying /value/ for out-of-range 
inputs, then the event doesn't fire.

</I>
This is the kind of experimentation I hope we will see in browsers with 
things like type=number.
