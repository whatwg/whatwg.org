&gt;<i> But presumably you want some kind of guarantee that the video will be able

</I>

Yes, I think we all mean the same thing here: asking the browser to buffer
enough to avoid underruns and to begin playing immediately without blocking,
which is more than preload=metadata and less than preload=auto.



&gt;<i> I intend to make that impossible by only allowing scripts to increase the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. preload-&gt;none makes no sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I haven't seen any use cases for auto-&gt;preload other than working around
</I>&gt;<i> browser buffering bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. It would be a silly API, because you can't reasonably mean &quot;I need it
</I>&gt;<i> all! No, I need only metadata! No, I need it all!&quot;, you're clearly trying to
</I>&gt;<i> do something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think it makes sense, with the right definitions.  preload=none means
&quot;don't preload any more data than you already have&quot;.  preload=metadata means
&quot;load metadata if you havn't already&quot;.  These make sense regardless of what
the state was previously.

By not catering to that, we can instead focus on fixing the
&gt;<i> API/implementations to support the actual use cases authors might have.
</I>

The most important unresolved use case is: how to allow limiting the amount
of prebuffered data, while also having a mechanism to disable that limit
when there isn't enough bandwidth.  The approaches I've seen proposed are 1:
have the browser try to guess statistically how big the buffer size needs to
be, and 2: disable the buffer limit when paused.

I don't trust #1.  It's impossible to predict bandwidth reliably.  If the
browser guesses too small, it'll be impossible to watch a video without
underruns.  Browsers should try to make a good guess, but there's got to be
an intuitive user override.

#2 is essentially that override, and it's what everyone is used to already:
if the video is underrunning, leave it paused until it buffers for a while.

However, there are cases where you'll want to pause the video without
triggering #2; for example, YouTube's pause captions, and after a
pause-and-rewind.  Simply having something like
preload=auto_only_when_paused wouldn't be enough.

That's why it seems like scripts should have some control over this.
Toggling between preload=metadata and preload=auto is one possible API to do
that.  Granted, browser-supplied controls should also be able to implement
this behavior, which suggests an attribute to allow it.  I'm not sure how to
get both cleanly.
