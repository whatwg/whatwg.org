Not too long ago, the browsers did allow timeouts of less than 10ms. Why was the &gt;= 10ms minimum timer duration spec'ed this way ?

I've tried once to improve a full-screen animation like that, and found that the cost of passing the data back and forth to the worker is so high that the worker-improved version was in fact slower (less fps), and on top of that the cpu was skyrocketing. A complete FAIL.

That was passing the objects serialized as text messages. Perhaps with structured clones, the situation may have been improved a bit.

But I think that the workers desperately need a mechanism that permitted to pass objects *quickly*, and *quickly* most likely means by reference not by copy.

To preserve shared-nothingness, the passed object (and the object's children) could be made unreachable (somehow, don't ask me) in the sending context as soon as passed to the worker. Perhaps other constraints might need to exist, e.g. perhaps no methods allowed in these objects.

This would make the transfers lightning fast, especially for heavy objects like images.

This would allow a threaded program to spend the time where it's worth, doing useful work, instead of copying data over and over, as it happens now.

Is it possible to achieve something like that ?
