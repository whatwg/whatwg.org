Oops, yeah. Fixed.

I assume you mean the online whitelist, not the &quot;network namespace&quot;.

I've adjusted the spec as you suggest.

As a side note: a redirect can never reach this point in the navigation 
algorthm, as they are handled earlier. This means that a captive portal 
captures URLs in fallback namespaces and the user can never get to the 
fallback file of a resource loaded in a browsing context when the network 
has a captive portal.

</I>
Why can't the pages just switch to a more AJAX-like model rather than 
having the main page still load over the network? The main page loading 
over the network is a big part of the page being slow.

Why do the valid security reasons not apply in this case?

I'm not a fan of hardcoded URLs, as they fail in a number of scenarios 
(e.g. a server shared by different teams that trust each other but may 
have different needs).

Before we discuss solutions, though, we should be clear what problem we're 
trying to solve. What is the security risk you are looking to mitigate?
