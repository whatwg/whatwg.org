</I>
Just to be clear, I'd be happy to add a fourth preload state to cater to  
this, I just want to be very clear that there is an actual problem first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another use case is the background of a game, where you want the video
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ready to start when gameplay begins.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For that you should really use &lt;audio preload=auto&gt;, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not if all you want is for the video to start with the rest of the game,  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> not to download the whole video.
</I>
But presumably you want some kind of guarantee that the video will be able  
to keep playing without waiting for the network, right? So if you don't  
use preload=auto, you'll at least need preload=playthrough or similar.  
Maybe that's precisely what you mean by preload=buffer?

&gt;<i> They're both minor, of course; helpful side-effects of preload=buffer,  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient justifications by themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.  To get this effect without preload=buffer, you could set  
</I>&gt;<i> preload=auto,
</I>&gt;<i> watch the buffered attribute to see when some data is actually  
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded,
</I>&gt;<i> then set it to preload=metadata to stop autoloading.  That's a minor  
</I>&gt;<i> hack,
</I>&gt;<i> and would need to watch out for browsers that don't autoload on
</I>&gt;<i> preload=auto, but it's probably good enough for the above cases.  It'd  
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> work if runtime changes to preload are applied, which would also be  
</I>&gt;<i> needed
</I>&gt;<i> for scripts to implement &quot;preload=auto only when paused&quot;.
</I>
I intend to make that impossible by only allowing scripts to increase the  
effective buffering strategy, because:

1. preload-&gt;none makes no sense.
2. I haven't seen any use cases for auto-&gt;preload other than working  
around browser buffering bugs.
3. It would be a silly API, because you can't reasonably mean &quot;I need it  
all! No, I need only metadata! No, I need it all!&quot;, you're clearly trying  
to do something else.

By not catering to that, we can instead focus on fixing the  
API/implementations to support the actual use cases authors might have.
