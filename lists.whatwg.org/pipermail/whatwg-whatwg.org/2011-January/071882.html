The separation of Mobile and Desktop seems arbitrary, in terms of specs:
if it's useful on the mobile, why would it not be useful on the desktop?

It's the same concept, a memory warning.

</I>It has a consistent meaning, again, though, we're talking about whether 
it's a semantic meaning or a technical one.

The technical meaning, &quot;we can't allocate memory&quot; isn't something that 
can be used on every platform, per Boris' comments.
The semantic meaning is pretty straightforward: low memory warning.

It's really up to the author to decide what they want to do with a low 
memory warning,
and up to the vendor to decide if they want to send one out.

Anything else seems to be impractical.

&gt;<i> For example, responding to being an idle tab by releasing resources is
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong thing to do if there's plenty of memory available.  I have 8
</I>&gt;<i> GB of memory and Firefox rarely uses more than 512 MB.  Don't make me
</I>I stated, in the example, that it would need more logic to function 
appropriately.

It was just a simple example to demonstrate that memory can be released
without OS support, and that applications could use that information.

&gt;<i> I'm not saying this is impossible, but memory management is
</I>&gt;<i> exceptionally complex, varies wildly across platforms, varies wildly
</I>&gt;<i> depending on how much memory and swap a system has, and on the
</I>&gt;<i> behavior of other applications on the system.  I'd be concerned about
</I>&gt;<i> a generic, loosely-defined &quot;lowmemory&quot; event with entirely unrelated
</I>&gt;<i> meanings encouraging developers to respond to it in ways that only
</I>&gt;<i> happen to make sense on the platform they're testing on.
</I>
They all have the same related meaning: get rid of unnecessary buffers, 
serialize and save to disk, if appropriate.

If I had a lowmemory event on the desktop, I'd run it through the exact 
same logic I would on mobile.

Without the generic lowmemory, we're just going to go on without the 
event (except in extensions),
with visibility/focus the only tool to test with.
