I do this, too, and disallowing this in comments would be very annoying.

This is probably a novice question since it seems too obvious, but
rather than disallowing &quot;--&quot;, why not disallow the entire comment
opening token, &quot;&lt;!--&quot;?

This whole thing seems like something that should be left to text
editors, though, not forced.  For example, if I enter &quot;/* /* text */&quot;
in a C file in Vim, it highlights the second &quot;/*&quot; in red as a warning.
 I don't need the compiler to reject it.
