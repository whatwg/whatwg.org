<PRE>
This thread (of which some especially salient points are included below) 
requested the addition of a feature or the codifying of a convention for 
uploading directory tree structures in &lt;input type=file&gt;.

I think that including relative directory paths with uploads is a quite 
reasonable feature. However, I don't think we really yet have good 
experience with what the right conventions should be. I would recommend 
that browser vendors experiment with this feature and report back their 
findings, so that we can converge on a proven convention.

</I>&gt;<i> Many sites allow you to upload multiple files, often images. HTML5 
</I>&gt;<i> allows this via &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; multiple&gt;. This works well when your 
</I>&gt;<i> files are all in one folder, but it may often be the case that files are 
</I>&gt;<i> spread across sub-folders, and in this case you have to do multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> transactions (or multiple &lt;input type=file multiple&gt; tags, which is just 
</I>&gt;<i> awkward) to upload your files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PROPOSAL: Allow a UA to recursively select and upload a directory of 
</I>&gt;<i> files. How the UA chooses to modify the file picker dialog is outside 
</I>&gt;<i> the scope of this spec, but for the sake of argument, assume that the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> lets you pick a folder and say &quot;upload all&quot;. Allow the UA to upload the 
</I>&gt;<i> files in the folder, with the subdirectories included in the filename 
</I>&gt;<i> with a directory separator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. assume I have:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C:\users\ian\a\b\1.jpg
</I>&gt;<i> C:\users\ian\a\b\2.jpg
</I>&gt;<i> C:\users\ian\a\c\3.jpg
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the user chooses &quot;a&quot;, the UA should be allowed to send all three 
</I>&gt;<i> files with filenames:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a/b/1.jpg&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a/b/2.jpg&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a/c/3.jpg&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as it would for the existing &lt;input type=file multiple&gt; implementation, 
</I>&gt;<i> with the addition of the directories and path separators (not full path, 
</I>&gt;<i> just the directory the user chose and sub-paths.)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Then the same action is done from another computer with a different

The spec doesn't actually disallow that currently; it just refers to &quot;the 
name&quot; without saying whether a name can include / or \ characters.
