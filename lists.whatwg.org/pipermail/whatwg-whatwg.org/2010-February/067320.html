<PRE>The big disadvantage to this proposal is that it won't work until browsers
implement the functionality, which would discourage anyone from using it
since the fallback is that no overlay/infobar is presented. Rowan's
implementation will allow the overlay/infobar to be displayed, but would
keep the target page contained in an iframe. I would imagine that almost
everybody that wants an overlay/infobar would opt to use a method that
forces the overlay/infobar to be displayed, even if that means continuing
with their current implementations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the spirit of paving some cow paths I'd like to put forward a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal for a future version of HTML.  The behavior I'm addressing is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sites that replace links to external content with a framed version of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that content, along with their own overlay of information and links.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think with some small tweaks it's possible to create a better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience for the user in these situations.  I wasn't able to find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any discussion of this use case in the archives.  Please excuse me if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this has already been discussed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  [snip details of proposal]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternate proposal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Add a new attribute on all hyperlink elements which accepts a URL as its
</I>&gt;<i> value. Let's call this new attribute &quot;infobar&quot; for want of a better name for
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>  * When the user follows that link, create a view where the main browser
</I>&gt;<i> window contains the page which was the href of the link, but where there is
</I>&gt;<i> also a smaller docked view, perhaps along the top of the browser window,
</I>&gt;<i> containing the page which at the URL given in the infobar attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Include a mandatory close button on the infobar panel.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Have this extra bar disappear if the user navigates away from the page
</I>&gt;<i> or chooses the close button.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Have this extra bar disappear if the infobar document calls
</I>&gt;<i> window.close.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Any links in the infobar document get loaded in the main browser window,
</I>&gt;<i> which implicitly closes the infobar since this is a navigation in the main
</I>&gt;<i> window.
</I>&gt;<i>  * If the infobar document causes navigation by a means other than a link,
</I>&gt;<i> such as setting document.location, it is just closed.
</I>&gt;<i>  * The infobar document *may* use window.open to open other windows --
</I>&gt;<i> subject to normal popup blocker restrictions -- if it needs to display some
</I>&gt;<i> UI that does not fit into the infobar form factor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This proposal compromises the flexibility of UI in what you called the
</I>&gt;<i> overlay document and what I called the infobar document. The most notable
</I>&gt;<i> omission is that it does not allow the overlay site to choose how the
</I>&gt;<i> infobar is displayed, since the main page is given precedence. It may be
</I>&gt;<i> desirable to provide some means by which the infobar document can request a
</I>&gt;<i> particular size, though the user-agent must impose restrictions on the size
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent a situation where the information bar appears more prominent than
</I>&gt;<i> the main document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This proposal, much like the &quot;ping&quot; attribute proposed previously, allows a
</I>&gt;<i> user-agent to offer a feature whereby the infobar can be skipped altogether.
</I>&gt;<i> It also causes the Referer header of the request to the main page to be the
</I>&gt;<i> original linking page and not the infobar page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It still has the challenge that the UA must find a way to make it
</I>&gt;<i> unambiguous that the infobar is *not* part of the main page, to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> attacks such as including an infobar containing a login form which looks
</I>&gt;<i> like it belongs to the main page when in fact it does not. One idea, which
</I>&gt;<i> may be too draconian, is to prevent the infobar frame from accepting
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard input altogether, and not allow any form elements within it to
</I>&gt;<i> receive focus. The infobar document may open a new window using window.open
</I>&gt;<i> if it needs to capture some information; that window will display the URL of
</I>&gt;<i> the document in its location bar, allowing the user to see what site it's
</I>&gt;<i> loaded from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is likely that these restrictions will cause site implementers
</I>&gt;<i> to continue with current practice in order to retain the flexibility they
</I>&gt;<i> currently enjoy.
