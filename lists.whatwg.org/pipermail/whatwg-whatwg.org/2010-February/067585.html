The big thing that GLSL is lacking is a stack, making it impossible to
recurse properly. This isn't a huge problem to work around, though can
result in ugly code. Especially if you want to support transparent
objects, in which case you'll essentially have to unroll recursion
manually by copying code.

This of course makes it impossible to recurse to arbitrary levels,
though that is something you generally don't want to do anyway in a
ray tracer since it costs a lot of CPU (or in this case GPU) cycles
for very little visual gain.

Indeed. Zooming is no problem at all and doesn't require any heavier
math than what is done in my demo. I experimented with allowing the
animations to be stopped at arbitrary points and then allowing
zooming. However it required more UI work than I was interested in
doing at the time.

The reason the demo goes jaggy after a while is due to limitations in
IEEE 754 floats.

But I should clarify that my point wasn't that WebGL makes
off-main-thread graphics processing unneeded. I just thought it was
funny that the two examples you brought up were exactly the things
that I had experimented with. Although I wouldn't be surprised if a
lot of the image processing effects that people want to do can be
written as shader programs. Would definitely be interesting to know if
WebGL could be supported on workers.
