</I>&gt;<i> so that when going back and forward, the information doesn't have to be

</I>
Can we publish this somewhere?  This is crucial and not obvious.

&gt;<i> If the Document is not recoverable, then recovering the state object makes
</I>&gt;<i> little sense, IMHO. We should not be encouraging a world in which the
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful state of a page is described by more than its URL. However,

</I>
Yes, but we want to make sure we're making the right UA decision. :)

I approached this from a different angle: Does it make sense to persist the
fact that two history entries with (potentially) different URLs correspond to
the same document across session history?  If pushState is supposed to replace
using the hash to store data, then we should persist this fact across session
restores, right?  But then we have to also persist the state data; otherwise,
if the page used pushState with no URL argument, it wouldn't be able to
distinguish between the two states.

I think you have a strong argument above.  On the other hand, the fact that
history entries X and Y are in fact the same Document is itself page state
which isn't stored in the URL.

Oh, interesting.  I didn't even notice that popstate is async again.  Good to
know.
