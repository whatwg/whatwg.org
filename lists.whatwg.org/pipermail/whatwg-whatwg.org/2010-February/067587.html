</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Neither of examples you posted seems to have the ability to zoom  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in, so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't think they show anything about doing this to extremely high  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accuracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I see your point that much of this particular computation can  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be done on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the GPU, up to probably quite high limits. Replace this example  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choice of non-data-parallel computation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Following the links, this demo does do zoom, but it will go all  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jaggy past a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain zoom level, presumably due to limitations of GLSL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/example01/?">http://learningwebgl.com/lessons/example01/?</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. Zooming is no problem at all and doesn't require any heavier
</I>&gt;<i> math than what is done in my demo.
</I>
Zooming does require more iterations to get an accurate edge, and  
WebGL has to limit your loop cycles at some point to prevent locking  
up the GPU. But of course once you are at that level it would be  
pretty darn slow on a CPU. I have seen mandelbrot demos that allow  
essentially arbitrary zoom (or at least, the limit would be the size  
of your RAM, not the size of a float).

&gt;<i> I experimented with allowing the
</I>&gt;<i> animations to be stopped at arbitrary points and then allowing
</I>&gt;<i> zooming. However it required more UI work than I was interested in
</I>&gt;<i> doing at the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason the demo goes jaggy after a while is due to limitations in
</I>&gt;<i> IEEE 754 floats.
</I>
On the CPU you could go past that if you cared to by coding your own  
high precision math. But it would be quite slow.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I should clarify that my point wasn't that WebGL makes
</I>&gt;<i> off-main-thread graphics processing unneeded. I just thought it was
</I>&gt;<i> funny that the two examples you brought up were exactly the things
</I>&gt;<i> that I had experimented with. Although I wouldn't be surprised if a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of the image processing effects that people want to do can be
</I>&gt;<i> written as shader programs. Would definitely be interesting to know if
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL could be supported on workers.
</I>
I'm very much interested in the possibility of WebGL on Workers, which  
is why I suggested, when reviewing early drafts of this proposal, that  
the object should be an OffscreenCanvas rather than a special Worker- 
only version of a 2d context (with implied built-in buffer). This  
makes it possible to extend it to include WebGL.

Maciej
