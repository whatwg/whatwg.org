OK.  That's 'merely' an annoyance, not a security threat.  There are
lots of ways authors can be obnoxious if they choose; I'm not sure it's
desirable, or even possible, to outlaw them.

&gt;<i> My boss was very insistent about content being displayed full screen,
</I>&gt;<i> to make the experience more immersive and reduce distractions ...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Please press the button to enter full-screen mode and start the
</I>&gt;<i> program&quot;, and the program would not start until full-screen mode was
</I>&gt;<i> entered. I could imagine games, and other content doing the same as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this behavior is fairly user hostile, however.
</I>
In general user-agents are allowed to display content in anyway that a
user has configured them to do, regardless of what the spec gives as the
normal behaviour.

&gt;<i> If a user wishes to view content scaled up to fill the window, without
</I>&gt;<i> the distractions of navigational links, comments, descriptions, and so
</I>&gt;<i> on, they don't usually have a way to do this. If it were possible to
</I>&gt;<i> use the full-screen button, but deny permission to actually go full
</I>&gt;<i> screen, and have that simply display the content in the full window
</I>&gt;<i> exactly as if it were full screen, it would give the users more
</I>&gt;<i> control over how they view the content.
</I>
I've seen Firefox options (possibly in an extension) which allow users
to tweak which toolbars and the like are still displayed when in
full-screen view.

If a browser (or an extension) wished to implement full-screen view as
still having borders, the title bar, status bar, and so on then it
could.  And there's nothing an author could do about it.

&gt;<i> Content authors should not be able to force fullscreen mode on users,
</I>&gt;<i> however, so I think it would be best if the spec allows UAs to send
</I>&gt;<i> the fullscreen event and set the fullscreen pseudoclass even if the
</I>&gt;<i> content is not actually filling the entire screen.
</I>
To say that slightly differently: authors can dictate that certain
output is only displayed when in full-screen view; but they have no
control how full-screen view looks for a particular user and user-agent.

&gt;<i> All the spec would have to say to cover all of the possible
</I>&gt;<i> implementations is that the fullscreen events may be sent even if the
</I>&gt;<i> content isn't actually filling an entire screen,
</I>
Allowing that behaviour is entirely reasonable.  Though I think it
should be covered by a more general statement that user-agents may
display things however they want if so-configured, rather than just
stating it for this particular narrow case.
