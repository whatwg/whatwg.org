The layout engine would decide how many pixels big it is, in exactly
the same way that it decides how big to draw a image that has width
specified in non-pixel units.

True, but:

a) Otherwise width:100% in CSS and width=&quot;100%&quot; in HTML would have
different meanings. Confusing!
b) Nobody uses it currently anyway - there's no content to break! I'm
not exaggerating - look through canvasdemos.com and I bet you won't
find a single case where the canvas is sized using CSS, for the very
reasons I have given, specifically:
c) It's slow, and looks rubbish.

I suppose an alternative might be to have some way of retrieving the
true size of the canvas, then you could do something like:

    canvas.width = canvas.trueWidthInPixels;

&gt;<i> #2 would work if all elements supported onresize (as has been proposed),
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that, a resize handler could simply reset the canvas width/height
</I>&gt;<i> attrs if desired (thereby achieving #1 and the clearing aspect of #2), no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence my question: what use cases here would not be covered simply by having
</I>&gt;<i> a general resize event on all elements?
</I>
Well, yes it would be good to have onresize for all elements. But you
still need to add width=&quot;...%&quot; support to the canvas tag otherwise it
will never *be* resized, so you couldn't achieve #1 with #2. I may
have misunderstood you here.
