The idea is that there will be a common codec that all browsers support, 
so that this is not an issue. Getting such a codec is an ongoing effort.

Indeed, if we can't get a common codec, the spec as written today is not 
a particularly good design. If we really can't solve this problem, then 
we'll have to introduce a declarative way of saying &quot;if you can't play any 
of the videos, here's what I want you to do instead&quot; -- but hopefully we 
won't have to go there.

Well if you're using script, you can just do whatever behaviour you want

Something like this will probably have to be used if we can't get a common

It's primary use is keeping the UIs updated (specifically the timers and 
the scrubber bars).


&gt;<i> On first glance, it would appear that this event would be useful for

</I>
Synchronising accompanying slides and animations won't work that well with 
an event, since you can't guarantee the timing of the event or anything 
like that. For anything where we want reliable synchronisation of multiple 
media, I think we need a more serious solution -- either something like 
SMIL, or the SMIL subset found in SVG, or some other solution.


&gt;<i> At 4 timeupdate events per second, it isn't all that useful. I can

</I>
The important thing with timeupdate is that it also fires whenever the 
time changes in a significant way, e.g. immediately after a seek, or when 
reaching the end of the resource, etc. Also, the user agent can start 
lowering the rate in the face of high CPU load, which makes it more 
user-friendly than setInterval().

There surely is a better solution than copying data from the &lt;video&gt;

3Hz seems a little slow for the timer -- you'd want at least 10Hz so you 
can show a tenths-of-a-second timer. More than that seems pointless 
though.

That's only a temporary situation, though, so it shouldn't inform our

captions and time-synchronised animations.

timeupdate's primary use case is indeed this UI, which is why the spec 
requires a 4Hz minimum even if the frame rate is slower.

For this timeupdate is terrible. You need something like the old cuerange 
interface, and we'll introduce something for this in the next version for 
sure, along with captions support. All we're waiting for is for 
implementations to be of high enough quality that the existing spec can be 
reliably used by authors.

</I>
Thank you for this detailed problem description and discussion of a 
suggested solution.

I think my recommendation would be something similar to what you suggest 
above regarding an HTTP header, but more specific to the Content-Type 
header: a new MIME parameter similar to &quot;codecs&quot; that describes the power 
needed for playback, in terms of network bandwidth, CPU, etc. This could 
just be boiled down to a number, e.g. &quot;1&quot; for today's &quot;low&quot; and &quot;2&quot; for 
today's &quot;high&quot;, with the number being increased over the years as we get 
better and better.

Alternatively, we could extend Media Queries to specify the kind of CPU 
and bandwidth expected to be needed for a media resource. This would fit 
right into the Media Queries model.

Or, of course, we could add an attribute to &lt;source&gt;, as you suggest.

The best thing to do is to approach browser vendors directly (e.g. on 
their relevant mailing lists, like webkit-dev for WebKit, or the Mozilla 
newsgroups for Firefox), and see if they would be interested in doing 
something like this. The WHATWG FAQ gives some detail on this:

What's the case where supportsFullscreen would be false?

That seems like more than necessary. Why not just let the author do the

These seem like reasonable requirements. (Navigation restrictions maybe

&gt;<i> * show an animation as the window enters fullscreen so the user can see

</I>&gt;<i> * show an hard-to-spoof overlay with some text that tells the user that

</I>&gt;<i> * show an affordance to allow the user to exit fullscreen (e.g. a close

</I>&gt;<i> * limit arbitrary keyboard input unless 'enableKeys' is true
</I>
These seem like reasonable UA features.


&gt;<i> * make the location field available to the user so that they can see the 
</I>&gt;<i> URL even when in fullscreen
</I>
I think we'd want this to only be visible when the mouse moved, I wouldn't 
want to watch a movie with a location bar the whole time :-)


&gt;<i> * disallow enterFullscreen() from a frame or iframe
</I>
That seems like a bad idea because it's expected that embedded video 
players will be in iframes.


&gt;<i> * if focussed on an element, drop out of fullscreen if that element is 
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the DOM
</I>
I'm not convinced we need to make the API element-specific.

Could you elaborate on this? It seems like this would only let pages make 
other pages full-screen... but they can already do that by making 
themselves full-screen and showing the inner iframe.

We can do that with an API that just does page-wide fullscreen -- when the 
page requests fullscreen mode, it makes the relevant bit take the full 
width of the page, and then only if the user agrees to fullscreen does the 
window actually go fullscreen.

Indeed. Generally this is free (CSS will just handle it automatically).

</I>
Yeah... it might be ok to have only the &quot;exit full screen&quot; event and have 
it trigger just when the user declines or exits? That way if the user does 
nothing, the page can't know, and it'll just render &quot;full window&quot; rather 
than &quot;full screen&quot;.


It seems like this API is best put on the Screen object, which I believe 
effectively means it belongs in the CSSOM spec and not the HTML spec. 
Anne, is this something you are willing to spec?

HTMLImageElement is different for historical reasons. I made &lt;video&gt;'s 
height and width be DOMStrings for consistency with the rest.
