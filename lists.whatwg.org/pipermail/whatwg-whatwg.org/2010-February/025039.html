The server-side session management you describe is usually implemented 
via cookies, which as you note are scoped to a particular site and do 
not consider a particular window.

Cookies and sessionStorage are conceptually similar in that both of them 
are mechanisms to allow a site to store data on the client. 
sessionStorage sets the scope of this data to be a (site, window) tuple 
rather than just site.

So it seems like your use-case could also be addressed by providing an 
interface to sessionStorage that uses HTTP headers, allowing the server 
to use sessionStorage in the same way that cookies are used, without 
requiring client-side script and thus requiring the data to be set via 
an HTML page.

To emulate the server-side session mechanisms you describe, you'd simply 
use a single sessionStorage value containing a session id which gets set 
in response to any request that does not provide it.
