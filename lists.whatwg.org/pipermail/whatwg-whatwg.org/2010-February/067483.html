</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Falling back to the default color for the placeholder text (what

</I>&gt;<i> placeholder text is more likely to be distinguishable from
</I>&gt;<i> non-placeholder text. &#160;However, there's no guarantee of that, nor is

</I>&gt;<i> having no placeholder text show up at all is already the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be inclined towards the pseudo-class, though, partly since that
</I>&gt;<i> failure mode bothers me less, and partly since it's a lot simpler
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe not to implement in one engine, but probably to implement

Anne suggested in IRC using the pseudoclass approach, and pairing it
with the ::value pseudoelem from the Basic UI Module.  You could get
whichever behavior you wanted then, and theoretically lean on an
existing definition to decide what properties should apply. (Actually,
the Basic UI module says nothing about what properties are
appropriate, but this could be a decent opportunity to finally clean
up that definition.  Tantek's said he plans to revive the draft
soon...)
