<PRE>I think I agree with Tim here.  When you ask to watch &quot;360p&quot; content, you are asking for content that has 360 lines of pixels to be displayed to you.  You're not asking for whatever is displayed to you to occupy only 360 lines of pixels on your display. Yes, when it is shown larger, then filtering etc. is done to avoid pixel-doubling blocky artifacts;  this does not increase (and, we hope, not decrease) the amount of information in the scene.

With the advent of higher-resolution displays, and the ability to use CSS with HTML to set 'sensible' sizes of video relative to other page content, the assumption that video will always be displayed in a 1:1 ratio of source (coded, transmitted) pixel to display pixel is increasingly untenable.
