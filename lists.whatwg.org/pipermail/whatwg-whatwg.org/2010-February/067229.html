That's a pretty good idea. I think we should probably do this when we add 
more types to the DataTransfer object.

One of many.

</I>
Fair enough. I've removed the copy/paste mode of drag-and-drop.


I'll deal with the copy/cut/paste events separately.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Windows, [...] we use the file stream to transfer the data between

</I>&gt;<i> application will not be blocked if it uses a background thread (this is 
</I>&gt;<i> what Windows Shell does). On MacOSX, a file stream is also used for such 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, we need to provide more metadata about the download when we 
</I>&gt;<i> call DataTransfer.setData(&quot;DownloadURL&quot;, ...). This is because on 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows we need to know about the file name and size when the drag is 
</I>&gt;<i> initiated. We can wait till we get the headers to extract the file name 
</I>&gt;<i> and size but this is blocking. Even more, if the http chunk mode is 
</I>&gt;<i> used, we cannot get the size from the headers.
</I>
So how would you provide the file size?


&gt;<i> On MacOSX, we need to provide the mime type and file name. Could we 
</I>&gt;<i> consider adding mime type, file name and size information into the data 
</I>&gt;<i> value parameter of setData method? For example,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    dataTransfer.setData(&quot;DownloadURL&quot;, &quot;text/plain:1000:<A HREF="http://example.com/download.txt">http://example.com/download.txt</A>&quot;);
</I>
I think we should just have a &quot;promise&quot; mechanism rather than one 
hard-coded for URLs. But I think it's probably best for us to wait until 
we have the current spec implemented reliably and sanely before adding 
something like that. We don't even have a good test suite for the 
drag-and-drop API yet.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The issue that I'm having is that if the DataTransfer object says 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that it has Files, I have no way to determine what type those files 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; are. (In this case, I only want to accept image files.) I understand 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that the DataTransfer shouldn't have the content of the files for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; security reasons, but it would be helpful if it did contain the file 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; names and/or MIME types.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I could provide a second attribute with the types of the files, would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that work? I suppose if we did this, we should remove the &quot;Files&quot; fake 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type. That might not be a bad idea in general, it's kind of a hack. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure how I feel about having multiple different ways of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; representing the data in a DataTransfer object... It would give a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clean precedent for adding other features, though, like promises, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which some people have requested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple different ways to get the same info doesn't seem great, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter to me as long as the information is available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another option is to throw an error if developers try to access 
</I>&gt;<i> forbidden attributes during dragenter/dragover.
</I>
I haven't added this for now, because Firefox 3.6 already shipped with 
Files and I think it'd be better to get the API stablised on what's 
already specified before adding more (and since it's shipped, I'd rather 
not remove the existing features).

However, what I think we should do in the next version (in a few months, 
maybe) is have a new way of exposing the data, as Eduard suggested, which 
has one item per &quot;thing&quot; in the data, and which in all but the dragstart 
and drop events only exposes the type information.

I've noted this in a comment in the spec.

</I>&gt;<i> Given that, would it make sense to change the spec to make format

</I>
Webkit and Firefox are case-sensitive. IE only does &quot;TEXT&quot; and &quot;URL&quot;, but 
case-insensitively (at least for Text, I didn't test URL). Chrome is 
case-insensitive for everything.

Tough call. I guess we'll go with just converting everything to lowercase, 
so that it's case-insensitive.

BTW I noticed Chrome includes &quot;Text&quot; and &quot;URL&quot; in the .types list. That's 
incorrect according to the spec.
