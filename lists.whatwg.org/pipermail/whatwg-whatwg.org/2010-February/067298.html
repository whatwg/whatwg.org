&gt;<i> &#160;hello
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been working around a &quot;game music&quot; composing application called
</I>&gt;<i> Kunquat, which is completely unrelated to web. Discussing various
</I>&gt;<i> details of the said desktop application has however, awaken me to
</I>&gt;<i> think about related issues. At times we have discussed implementing
</I>&gt;<i> similar pieces of music software for the browser environment. With
</I>&gt;<i> Google Chrome OS coming up, being able to create music in a browser
</I>&gt;<i> environment is becoming increasingly, but similar interfaces are also
</I>&gt;<i> needed for implementing games, or writing players for formats
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported by browsers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am excited about html5 supporting audio files on web sites, at the
</I>&gt;<i> same time I am worried about how the more general need of generating
</I>&gt;<i> sound. It seems to me that it has been forgotten from the
</I>&gt;<i> specification. Lets consider a case where one wants to create a simple
</I>&gt;<i> web instrument that will produce a sine wave, send it to the speakers,
</I>&gt;<i> and let user alternate the parameters used for producing the
</I>&gt;<i> continuous sound. With the current model, one wishing to do so is in
</I>&gt;<i> trouble. First of all she will need a java-script library for turning
</I>&gt;<i> the wave into an ogg file. Then she needs to turn the vorbis file into
</I>&gt;<i> a data url and add it as an audio element to the web page. This is
</I>&gt;<i> still tolerable, but trying to add the next chunk of sound with
</I>&gt;<i> another audio element at the exact right time for the sound to be
</I>&gt;<i> continuous is the real killer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lack of a simple audio outputting method leads to hacks, such as
</I>&gt;<i> the one used in jsnes ( <A HREF="http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/">http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/</A> ).
</I>&gt;<i> Jsnes is a web application used for playing old NES games. It
</I>&gt;<i> currently outputs sound by having a separate flash application read
</I>&gt;<i> the sound from some variable. Other than that the application is
</I>&gt;<i> java-script. Starting flash for playing the sound seems to drain lots
</I>&gt;<i> of resources atleast on my computer. I bought my computer ~1 year ago.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet I can not play the games with sound turned on using Chrome, which
</I>&gt;<i> is supposed to have the best js-engine currently available. Without
</I>&gt;<i> sound the game runs fine with plenty of cpu cycles left, but turning
</I>&gt;<i> sound on changes the situation completely. Thus I believe that a
</I>&gt;<i> standard way for producing sound would help both software users and
</I>&gt;<i> developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest that we add a a function for playing sound. The function
</I>&gt;<i> should probably be frame specific. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> window.outputaudio(someaudio). The parameter &quot;someaudio&quot; would be a
</I>&gt;<i> list of two channels [left,right] with both left and right being
</I>&gt;<i> equally long lists of frames represented as floats. The function
</I>&gt;<i> should add the sound into a hidden circular buffer, where it would get
</I>&gt;<i> automatically consumed by a player. In case someaudio would not fit
</I>&gt;<i> into the free space, the function should block until enough space has
</I>&gt;<i> been made available, and return only after someaudio has been
</I>&gt;<i> successfully transfered into the buffer. Adding more than half of the
</I>&gt;<i> buffer at once should result in an error, as using such big chunks may
</I>&gt;<i> cause problems that may disrupt continuous playback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are at least two parameters open for discussion here: the size
</I>&gt;<i> of the hidden buffer, and amplitude of the sound samples. We could
</I>&gt;<i> either settle for some fixed values, or have some way of configuring
</I>&gt;<i> this. If we settle for fixed values we could use e.g. 96 kHz for the
</I>&gt;<i> amplitude. This is what is used in DVDs. I'm not entirely sure about a
</I>&gt;<i> decent fixed buffer size, but basically a bigger buffer should never
</I>&gt;<i> cause problems to an application. Now what is big enough, is another
</I>&gt;<i> question. The buffer would in theory have to be reserved for each
</I>&gt;<i> window, multiplying the amount with the amount of windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be happy to see responses regarding the parameters, the API, and
</I>&gt;<i> the bureaucracy required for getting the feature into html5
</I>&gt;<i> specification.
</I>
I think the main thing that is needed here is research and
experiments, and then use that as basis for a concrete proposal.
There's some of that going on at
