</I>&gt;<i>  Imagine a list of files showing on a website (like google docs, or like

</I>&gt;<i> dialog on the UA to select the folder where the files will be copied to.

</I>&gt;<i>  This is b) which we have, agreed, but not what I meant by allowing
</I>&gt;<i> multiple file download. It's allowing the download of just one file, the zip
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2)  A multipart response with the files as parts, each part having

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  as far as I know, and I could be wrong, this would suffer from what I
</I>&gt;<i> described in a), i.e. there would be a dialog propping up to accept each

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  You can gzip this multipart response to get the compression behavior you

</I>&gt;<i> So how would you decide where each file goes? Would you just pick a
</I>&gt;<i> directory and it chucks all the files in there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that would be the most common use. Allowing for choosing several
different folders for different files would be left up to the UA. I don't
thing the UA should bother with that, though; the waste of time to select a
different folder for different sets of files negates the benefits of
downloading 15 files in one go as 15 distinct files.


&gt;<i> Also, the genius of archive files (zip, tar, rar) is that you can specify a
</I>&gt;<i> path within the archive, so that a collection of files which requires a
</I>&gt;<i> certain structure (a web page and its assets) are retained.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed that's one benefit of archived files, but I'm looking for a more
general use that's common within the desktop os yet it cannot be reproduced
easily over a web app, namely copy a select set of file from here (website)
to there (a folder in your desktop) without having to resort to
decompression of archives.


&gt;<i> Most operating systems have built-in features to read into these files as
</I>&gt;<i> if they weren't archives at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed, but it only goes so far. Mac OS doesn't, not natively, as far as I
can see. I remember Windows did, but only for the file you were opening. If
you opened a program to read a file from within the zip and that file
depended on another file also in the zip, it wouldn't work. But that might
have been fixed long ago. Still, this is a request I get often enough from
non-technical people. We are covering this with a Java applet, but that
brings its own set of issues.

/J

Windows can only do this for zip files, Linux can do it for most archive
&gt;<i> types, not sure about MacOS or other OS's.
