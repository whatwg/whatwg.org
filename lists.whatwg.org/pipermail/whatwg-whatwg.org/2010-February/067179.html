Perhaps we'd enforce a same-origin rule where the iframe contents have to be from the same domain as the main page, then?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC, it has been shown that at least as implemented in Flash Player, it is possible to draw enough distractions to make the users unable to read this message.
</I>
That's why I said &quot;hard to spoof&quot;. The Flash overlay makes the mistake of not being contrasty enough. An improvement would be to dim out the rest of the content while showing this overlay.

&gt;<i> Also, when the site is legitimate, it's quite annoying to have the overlay there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I'd rather have to click through a once per-Origin authorization bar (like geolocation in Firefox) than watch the &quot;press esc&quot; overlay every time.
</I>
That's a possibility, yes.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * make the location field available to the user so that they can see the URL even when in fullscreen
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This defeats the point of full screen. If I want a 16:9 video to go full screen on a 16:9 display, I want all screen pixels to be used for the video.
</I>
I said &quot;make available&quot;, not &quot;should be visible at all times&quot;. I was thinking of a behavior where it shows up at the top of the screen if the user moves the mouse close to the top.

&gt;&gt;<i> * drop out of fullscreen if navigating to another page
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would constrain slide shows do be unnecessarily Ajaxy and less linkable with per-slide JavaScriptless URLs.
</I>
Maybe a same-origin test could be used here too? But personally I think it's OK to force a fullscreen &quot;application&quot; to rely on AJAX and twiddling location.hash, rather than loading new pages.
