The problem comes from lack of escaping of any kind, so change in escaping method will not fix the problem, i.e.,

Hello $unescaped_name

is as vulnerable as:

Hello &lt;iframe sandbox srcdoc=&quot;$unescaped_name&quot;&gt;

That's problem with the frameworks (a big one, admittedly). However, there are templating engines that escape all variables, everywhere, by default, and this solves the problem very well.

Addition of token-based sandbox won't improve anything in cases where authors forget to escape or wrongly assume that input is already filtered/escaped or harmless. If someone forgets to add escape(), why would they remember to add &lt;sandbox&gt;? Additionally &lt;sandbox&gt; will cause new security problem in all current UAs, so for plain text I don't see any benefit at all.

However, if we're going to introduce token-based sandbox anyway, I suggest putting token in tag name:

&lt;sandbox-$token&gt;...&lt;/sandbox-$token&gt;

where $token is the random part. This avoids oddity of attributes in closing tag, and is compatible with XML. In XML you could also use:

&lt;$token:sandbox xmlns:$token=&quot;&#8230;&quot;&gt;&lt;/$token:sandbox&gt;
