I agree we need more access than what the Blob has to offer, like
sequential and random access at least, and read/write, especially if we
are to copy EXIF data from one source image to a computed image.

&gt;<i> However I suspect it'd be useful to be able to extract as Blob object

</I>
I am not sure I like this &quot;as well&quot; ;) In my case I need to extract
binary data from a canvas, modify this binary data, then send it using
XmlHttpRequest (which only accepts a File or Blob IIRC), so this binary
type has to be accepted by XmlHttpRequest as well, for sending.

Now that I think about it, is it possible to replace a regular form's
file input list (the list of File objects selected from an input of type
&quot;file&quot; with multiple files enabled) with &quot;processed&quot; files? Like data
coming out of a canvas, possibly by storing them locally (via storage)
to get a File instance. Or are we then limited to sending those
processed files via XmlHttpRequest?
