</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I've talked with some other folks on WebKit (Maciej and Oliver) about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; a canvas that is available to workers. They suggested some nice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; modifications to make it an offscreen canvas, which may be used in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Document or in a Worker.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What is the use case for this? It seems like in most cases you'll want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to display something on screen to the user, and so the difference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; comes down to shipping drawing commands across the pipe, vs. shipping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the pixel data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes the commands take up a lot more CPU power than shipping the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pixels.  Lets say you wanted to have a really rich map application that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looked great, was highly interactive/fluid, but didn't use a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bandwidth.  Rendering different parts of the screen on different workers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems like a legit use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I admit to not being a graphics expert, but I would imagine you have
</I>&gt;<i> to do quite a lot of drawing before
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Drawing on offscreen canvas
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Cloning the pixel data in order to ship it to a different thread
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Drawing the pixel data to the on-screen canvas
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Presumably a smart UA implementation could make 1 and 3 be nearly nothing
(with copy on write and such) in many cases.


&gt;<i> gets to be cheaper than
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Drawing to on-screen canvas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're assuming only one core.  The norm on the desktops and laptops these
days is multiple cores.

 &gt;&gt; The other use case I can think of is doing image manipulation and then
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sending the result directly to the server, without ever displaying it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to the user. However this is first of all not supported by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; suggested API, and second I can't think of any image manipulation that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you wouldn't want to display to the user except for scaling down a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; high resolution image. But that seems like a much simpler API than all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of canvas. And again, not even this simple use case is supported by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the current API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK, so you solve this one problem.  Then soon enough someone wants to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something more than just scale an image.  So you you add another one off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution.  Then another.  Next thing you've essentially created canvas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prime....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've always started with use cases and then created APIs that
</I>&gt;<i> fulfills those use cases, rather than come up with APIs and hope that
</I>&gt;<i> that fulfills some future use case. That seems like a much wiser path
</I>&gt;<i> here too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've pinged a couple people within Google to see if we can re-gather what
some of the original use cases were.  I'll admit that resizing and rotating
were definitely at the top of the list, but I believe vector based drawing
was there too.  Will report back on this when I have more data.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'll note that there are a bunch of teams that want this behavior, though
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't remember exactly what for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you're sure that it fulfills their requirements? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At least some of it is &quot;simple&quot; image
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resizing type stuff.  Most of it is related to doing image manipulation
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the app is probably going to need soon (but isn't on the screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet...and that we don't want to slow the main thread for).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Really, if you use picassa (or iPhoto or some other competitor) it really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't hard to think of a lot of uses for this.  Even for non-photo Apps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (like Bespin) I could totally see it being worth it to them to do some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rendering off the main loop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For many of these things you want to display the image to the user at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time as the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To be honest, I think the applications are largely self
</I>&gt;<i> evident...especially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you think about taking rich desktop apps and making them web apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So picassa and/or iPhoto uses off-main-thread *drawing* (not image
</I>&gt;<i> scaling) today?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't know.  But you're probably right that scaling (and rotating) is
probably the bulk of what is computationally expensive.


&gt;<i>  &gt;  Are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you sure that you're negativity towards an offscreen canvas isn't simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being driven by implementation related worries?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite certain. I can promise to for every API suggested, that if there
</I>&gt;<i> are no use cases included, and no one else asks, I will ask what the
</I>&gt;<i> use case is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Fair enough.
