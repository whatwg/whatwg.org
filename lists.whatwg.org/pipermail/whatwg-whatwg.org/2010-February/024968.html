</I>
Anything's _possible_, it's just that it's a lot more complicated. As 
Jonas said earlier in the thread, making history traversal asynchronous is 
likely to make things easier for Mozilla too. Sorry for overstating the 
case above, I have a tendency to exaggerate!


&gt;<i> How should UA handle this case? User presses back (which hopefully does 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much the same as history.back()) but web page has some loop like 
</I>&gt;<i> script which sets location.hash all the time.
</I>
I would recommend that implementations prioritise tasks queued by user 
interaction, so that the script does not preempt the user's action. 
However, since that is a user interface issue, the spec does not specify 
it in any detail. (The spec doesn't require that you expose a back button 
at all.)


&gt;<i> &gt; If we can't do this asynchronously, it's going to really suck for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiprocess UAs,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depends for example on whether UA wants to put different domains in same

</I>&gt;<i> back()/forward() should be possible. Maybe just not as easy. So I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> sure that &quot;suck for multiprocess UAs&quot; is a really good argument here.
</I>
Certainly it isn't well-expressed, but it does seem important to make sure 
that the technology we are specifying can be sanely implemented in a 
multi-process architecture, since two UAs are already shipping with that 
technology, and at least one other (Mozilla) is working on a similar 
effort. I don't think anyone would deny that there are advantages to such 
an approach.


&gt;<i> Uh, changing hashchange again to async. We must stop changing that all 
</I>&gt;<i> the time. Though in this case I like the change. I never really 
</I>&gt;<i> understood the sync hashchange, or the reasoning why it was changed to 
</I>&gt;<i> be sync.
</I>
Yeah, my apologies for the back-and-forth on this particular issue. I try 
to minimise churn in general, but in this case I failed.


&gt;<i> So history.back(); history.back(); would queue 2 tasks?
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> And first one document is loaded (maybe from bfcache), and it could

</I>&gt;<i> Kind of strange way to handle history.back().
</I>
For cross-document loads, back() has always been asynchronous, so I don't 
think that particular case is a change.

I agree that it is not completely intuitive.
