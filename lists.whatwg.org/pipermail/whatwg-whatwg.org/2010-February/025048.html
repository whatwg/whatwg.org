Yes, but that doesn't exist at the moment, so our current choices are to use timeupdate and to use setInterval().

</I>
I agree, it is important to be able to reduce the rate in the face of high CPU load, but as currently implemented in WebKit, if you use timeupdate to keep anything in sync with the video, it feels fairly laggy and jerky. This means that for higher quality synchronization, you need to use setInterval, which defeats the purpose of making timeupdate more user friendly.

Perhaps this is just a bug I should file to WebKit, as they are choosing an update interval at the extreme end of the allowed range for their default behavior; but I figured that it might make sense to mention a reasonable default value (such as 30 times per second, or once per frame displayed) in the spec, to give some guidance to browser vendors about what authors will be expecting.

</I>
This was not my use case (my use case was just synchronizing bullets, slide transitions, and animations to video), but an example I can think of is using this to composite video. Most (if not all) video formats supported by &lt;video&gt; in the various browsers do not store alpha channel information. In order to composite video against a dynamic background, authors may copy video data to a canvas, then paint transparent to all pixels matching a given color.

This use case would clearly be better served by video formats that include alpha information, and implementations that support compositing video over other content, but given that we're having trouble finding any video format at all that the browsers can agree on, this seems to be a long way off, so stop-gap measures may be useful in the interim.

Compositing video over dynamic content is actually an extremely important use case for rich, interactive multimedia, which I would like to encourage browser vendors to implement, but I'm not even sure where to start, given the situation on formats and codecs. I believe I've seen this discussed in Theora, but never went anywhere, and I don't have any idea how I'd even start getting involved in the MPEG standardization process.

I'm assuming that you mean &quot;no faster than once per frame&quot;?

Anyone who depends on a certain number of events being fired instead of paying attention to the actual time, whether via timeupdate or setInterval or any other method, will be burnt by dropped frames, GC pauses, or any other form of system slowdown. I'm not sure that making timeupdate less useful by not updating often enough will really help people avoid bugs.

</I>
I think that it can only work for this purpose if it is good enough that people will actually use it. If an author gets much better results with setInterval than with timeupdate (or a combination that feeds off of both, to get good results when scrubbing and in normal playback), she will likely use that approach and defeat the purpose of scaling based on CPU load (unless, of course, setInterval does the same thing).

You don't get 10Hz with the current timeupdate, you get 4Hz.

The problem is, due to the slow pace of standards and browser development, we can sometimes be stuck with a temporary feature for many years. How long until enough IE users support HTML6 (or whatever standard includes a time-synchronization feature) for it to be usable? 10, 15 years?

Yes, you're absolutely right, something like the previously suggested cuerange interface would be much better. I'm interested in developing content before that is specced, implemented, and widely enough available in browsers to depend upon, however. I was hoping to use timeupdate for this purpose, but had to fall back to setInterval to get a good experience.

Right, though sometimes you need to do modifications to your interface that CSS can't handle. This should be covered by the element resize event work that is ongoing.

</I>
Yeah, that might be reasonable. I suppose if you always enter a full screen like mode when the API is called, you don't need the event for entering fullscreen. Would you want it anyhow for cases in which the user enters full screen by using the existing browser UI, or is that going to be considered an entirely different mode?
