I don't believe that there is any such 'need' and that the user should own that decision.  I, for example, basically refuse to use applications that have the hubris to assume that they should own the screen and cover all the parts they don't need with gray.  I didn't buy a large display to see grey painted everywhere;  I bought it so I *could* see multiple things at once.

</I>
The developer has no idea how big my screen is, how many I have, or a host of other questions.

&gt;<i> I feel the user has opted not to view that content at all. I don't mind at all that the user has no choice but to skip that content; it's similar behaviour to a user quitting a desktop application that insists on running full-screen.

Indeed.
