When I use a jQuery validation plugin for my forms today, I pretty
much always rely on the default error message that the library
provides.  It's rare for me to override it; I typically only provide
messages when I'm specifying a custom validation that doesn't have a
message (as the default error message for a custom validation rule is
far too generic).

So yes, I'd use validationMessage in my own UI.  It's easier, as it
lets me be completely agnostic about the actual error, and just plug
in whatever the error is into my custom UI.

&gt;<i> More generally, however, who says the UA will provide actual text for

</I>&gt;<i> though, I guess.
</I>
I don't know that I've ever seen a validated form rely solely on
non-textual UI for anything, except possibly the failure to fill out a
required field (and even then, there's a message somewhere on the page
explaining that all the fields with a red border are required or
whatever).

If that were to happen, though, an artificial string would be
appropriate.  Ian, do you think this needs to be explicitly stated?

I *strongly* disagree.  #1 is by far the MOST important use-case for
these features, in my opinion.  Without it, several of the new input
types and attributes are basically useless.

Just as important, requiring the author to handle the UI means that
accessibility will likely be impaired.  I'm very excited about the new
types and error messages making my forms significantly more
accessible.  When you can provide accessibility like this *for free*
with no author intervention, it's silly to pass up the opportunity.
