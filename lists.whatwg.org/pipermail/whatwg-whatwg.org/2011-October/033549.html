<PRE>1) How much should UI-based and API-based fullscreen interact? To me it  
seems nice if pressing F11 would also give you fullscreenchange events and  
that Document.fullscreen would yield true. Why would you not want to give  
the same presentation via native activation and API-based activation? Of  
course when you activate it UI-wise, navigation should not exit it. For  
native &lt;video&gt; controls the case seems clearer that they should work using  
this API.


2) Chris brought forward the case of nesting. You have a fullscreen  
presentation (lets assume API-based activated for now) and in that  
presentation there's some video that the presenter wants to display  
fullscreen (lets assume the video player is a custom widget with API-based  
fullscreen activation for now). Once the presenter exits displaying the  
video fullscreen, the presentation should still be fullscreen.

Initially this was brought up with the video being hosted in a separate  
descendant document, but the video could be in the same document as well.  
roc suggested a model that works when you have separate documents and it  
could be made to work for the single document case too, as long as the  
level of nesting remains is no larger than required for the presentation  
scenario mentioned above.

Is that an acceptable limitation? Alternatively we could postpone the  
nested fullscreen scenario for now (i.e. make requestFullscreen fail if  
already fullscreen).
