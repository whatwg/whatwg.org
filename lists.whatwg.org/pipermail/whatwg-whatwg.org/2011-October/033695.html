&gt;<i> Hi WHATWG,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running a startup heavily invested in HTML5 2D game development (see
</I>&gt;<i> www.scirra.com). &#160;I apologise if what I'm about to mention has been
</I>&gt;<i> discussed before, but I haven't been involved before now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The retro (pixellated style) is still very popular in 2D gaming, and many
</I>&gt;<i> new games are still being made with this style. &#160;(Have a quick scroll
</I>&gt;<i> through <A HREF="http://www.tigsource.com/">http://www.tigsource.com/</A> and notice how many retro games are still
</I>&gt;<i> hitting headlines.) &#160;I've noticed most browsers today are using bilinear
</I>&gt;<i> filtering for scaling. &#160;Compared to point filtering (aka nearest neighbour)
</I>&gt;<i> this makes retro style games look blurry. &#160;See here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.scirra.com/images/point-vs-linear.png">http://www.scirra.com/images/point-vs-linear.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bilinear filtering does in fact result in a better quality display for many
</I>&gt;<i> modern games. &#160;However, it's unsuitable for retro style games as the image
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrates: seeing an entire game look that blurry is likely to make the
</I>&gt;<i> game unplayable. &#160;So I believe there's a real need for both, but the
</I>&gt;<i> standard leaves this as an implementation detail: &quot;The user agent may use
</I>&gt;<i> any filtering algorithm (for example bilinear interpolation or
</I>&gt;<i> nearest-neighbor).&quot; &#160;I propose that the standard is amended so both modern
</I>&gt;<i> and retro style games can use the most appropriate sampling algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> context.globalFilter = &quot;point&quot;; // set point filtering (nearest-neighbour)
</I>&gt;<i> context.globalFilter = &quot;bilinear&quot;; // set bilinear filtering
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some questions I anticipate:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Won't this slow down software renderers?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - Bilinear filtering can seriously impact performance in software rendered
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of the canvas 2D context. &#160;Generally bilinear is only
</I>&gt;<i> supported on hardware accelerated implementations. &#160;I think the best
</I>&gt;<i> solution is to allow implementors to choose the default, and not require
</I>&gt;<i> support for bilinear filtering (although it should be recommended). &#160;Modern
</I>&gt;<i> games using point filtering suffer a small degradation in visual quality,
</I>&gt;<i> but retro games using bilinear filtering suffer a massive degradation in
</I>&gt;<i> visual quality. &#160;So bilinear filtering could be optional, and optionally be
</I>&gt;<i> set as the default, but the ability to set point filtering should be
</I>&gt;<i> required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why not just scale the artwork yourself with nearest-neighbour and use that
</I>&gt;<i> in the game?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - HTML5 games have to run on a variety of screen sizes, ranging from
</I>&gt;<i> handsets to HD displays. &#160;A good solution to this is to use the scale()
</I>&gt;<i> method to fit to the window size. &#160;However, this scaling is done with
</I>&gt;<i> bilinear filtering in all current major browsers. &#160;Retro artwork drawn large
</I>&gt;<i> and scaled down looks blurry, and artwork drawn small and scaled large looks
</I>&gt;<i> blurry too. &#160;Also, rotating, scaling and sub-pixel positioning individual
</I>&gt;<i> objects can still make artwork look blurry, drawn at any size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Why not use WebGL?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - The WebGL API is much more complex than the Canvas 2D API. &#160;To make a
</I>&gt;<i> retro style 2D game, Canvas 2D is the obvious choice, and allows a much
</I>&gt;<i> quicker rate of development. &#160;This also avoids the issue of driver support,
</I>&gt;<i> hardware support and browser support associated with WebGL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall, I think this proposal is very simple, straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> standardise and implement, genuinely useful, and would significantly
</I>&gt;<i> encourage 2D gaming in HTML5 for comparitively little effort. &#160;Is it
</I>&gt;<i> possible that this could be included in the standard? &#160;Any
</I>&gt;<i> comments/suggestions/vendor-specific extensions I've missed?
</I>
The CSS Working Group is interested in this topic more generally for
all images or videos.  There was previously a property in the CSS3
Image Values spec for this; it's currently punted to the level 4 spec,
but you can find it in an older WD like
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110712/#image-rendering">http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110712/#image-rendering</A>&gt;.

Currently there are two values defined: 'auto' means &quot;do what you
want, preserving image quality&quot;, which will generally make pixel art
blurry; and 'crisp-edges' which means &quot;do what you want, but don't
blur edges or colors&quot;, which is expected to often use
nearest-neighbor, but is allowed to use more complex pixel-art scaling
algorithms.  There's been a persistent request to explicitly ask for
nearest-neighbor, so I expect that will be addressed at some point
with a value named 'pixelated' or something.

Once this property is implemented, browsers should respect it for
scaling &lt;canvas&gt;, so you won't need anything explicit in the API.
