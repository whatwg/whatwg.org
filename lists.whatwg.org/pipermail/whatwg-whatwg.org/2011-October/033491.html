Exactly, so then it seems that cancelFullscreen() should return early and  
queue a task to do the animation, change state, and fire the event.


&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that &quot;being fullscreen&quot; is a property of the top-level
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsing context. All that is potentially associated with a document
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the &quot;fullscreen element&quot;. If you have a document A with two

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go fullscreen from B, C would not report as &quot;being fullscreen&quot;. I mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure, there is no &quot;fullscreen element&quot; but it is definitely rendered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fullscreen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the proposed spec is written so far, I think Document.fullscreen is
</I>&gt;<i> meant to convey that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. If the document's full-screen element in the document, the
</I>&gt;<i>     full-screen element is rendered at viewport dimensions with browser
</I>&gt;<i>     UI hidden, or
</I>&gt;<i>  2. if the document's full-screen element is not in the document, the
</I>&gt;<i>     document is rendered at viewport dimensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key is the  :full-screen psuedo-class, for which the suggested UA
</I>&gt;<i> style rules enables the full-screen element appear to &quot;break out&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> containing frames and be rendered at the view-port size (assuming the
</I>&gt;<i> browser window is made viewport dimensions by the UA).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The :full-screen pseudo-class is defined to also apply to &quot;an &lt;iframe&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt; element whose child browsing context's Document is
</I>&gt;<i> in the full-screen state&quot;. So if a child document in an iframe doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have its full-screen element in the document, unless the document
</I>&gt;<i> reports being in full-screen state the :full-screen pseudo-class won't
</I>&gt;<i> apply to that document, and that document thus won't be rendered at
</I>&gt;<i> viewport dimensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we specified a Document.currentFullScreenElement attribute, then
</I>&gt;<i> Document.fullScreen would be equivalent to
</I>&gt;<i> (Document.currentFullScreenElement != null).
</I>
Ah right, my assumption was we would have document.fullscreenElement. My  
point was mainly that what goes fullscreen is not some Document, but it is  
the top-level browsing context.
