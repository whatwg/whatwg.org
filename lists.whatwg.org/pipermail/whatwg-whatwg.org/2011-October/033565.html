</I>&gt;<i> These modes cover different cases. F11 fullscreen mode is when the user

</I>
Except that the root element is special cased and will &#8212; as far as the end  
user is concerned &#8212; give the exact same visual effect as F11 fullscreen.  
So what you are saying is not true, unless we remove the special case for  
the root element, which might be a good idea.


&gt;<i> In this presentation-video case, if the video is in the same document or
</I>&gt;<i> in a same-origin subdocument, the page can script switching full-screen
</I>&gt;<i> between the &quot;main&quot; full-screen element and the video element and vice
</I>&gt;<i> versa (provided Element.requestFullScreen() while in fullscreen switches
</I>&gt;<i> the fullscreen element). So custom controls on the video element could
</I>&gt;<i> be implemented to solve this problem in the single document and in the
</I>&gt;<i> non-cross origin multi-document case.
</I>
That sounds like a pretty bad solution to me. It also fails for  
encapsulated cross-origin bindings (which are somewhat likely to arrive to  
the platform in due course).


&gt;<i> In the cross origin multi-document case, if document.exitFullScreen()
</I>&gt;<i> causes all documents to exit full-screen (not just the target document
</I>&gt;<i> and its descendents) it would also be pretty easy for the parent
</I>&gt;<i> document to listen for the fullscreenchange event when the video exited,
</I>&gt;<i> the and show its button for the main document to re-enter fullscreen. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be a 2-click process to fullscreen change from the video back to
</I>&gt;<i> the main document, but no big drama really.
</I>
It does not sound that great to me. Maybe the presentation case would  
instead be solved by just letting the page enlarge the video itself.


&gt;&gt;<i> roc suggested a model that works when you have separate documents and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it could be made to work for the single document case too, as long as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the level of nesting remains is no larger than required for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presentation scenario mentioned above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could go with Roc's suggestion and provided requestFullScreen()
</I>&gt;<i> switches fullscreen mode we'd be ok, but I think that would complicate
</I>&gt;<i> the API a bit much. Seems better to keep it simple.
</I>
I think keeping it simple argues for the following:

* Only allow a single element to go fullscreen
* If an element is already fullscreen dispatch fullscreenerror
* Not special case the root element


&gt;&gt;<i> Is that an acceptable limitation? Alternatively we could postpone the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nested fullscreen scenario for now (i.e. make requestFullscreen fail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if already fullscreen).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Make Element.requestFullScreen() switch the fullscreen element (so
</I>&gt;<i>     we can handle the single document and same-origin documents cases)
</I>&gt;<i>     when called while any document is in fullscreen mode, and
</I>&gt;<i>  2. make document.exitFullScreen() exit all documents from fullscreen.
</I>&gt;<i>     It keeps the API simple, and provided we fire fullscreenchange
</I>&gt;<i>     events whenever a documents fullscreen attribute changes, pages can
</I>&gt;<i>     detect this and provide buttons to restore the user to their desired
</I>&gt;<i>     fullscreen state.
</I>
I think I agree more with Darin Fisher and James Graham.
