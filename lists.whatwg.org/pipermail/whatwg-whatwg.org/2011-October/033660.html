</I>
And if &lt;div type=nav&gt; were used, it would be rendered as a block in 
nonconforming browsers too. (The point about more or less required 
default rendering with display: block is taken as a correction to my 
statement above, but it does not really change my point. Rather, 
strengthens it.)

&gt;<i> What about &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;b&gt;?
</I>
Yes, what about them? They have been in HTML since the very beginning. 
If you were to add _new_ markup for emphasis into HTML, I would suggest 
that you don't add a new element, like &lt;key&gt;, but rather an attribute - 
to an element that comes closest in meaning and default rendering, like 
&lt;strong type=key&gt; or &lt;b type=key&gt;.

&gt;<i> Google admits certain aspects of its indexing algorithm, and this is but
</I>&gt;<i> a little part of it. They would be certainly missing a trick if they
</I>&gt;<i> weren't also indexing based on HTML5 tags as well, adding context to a
</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>
There's a lot we can speculate about potential use of the new markup 
elements and remarkably little factual evidence. But surely if Google 
can recognize &lt;nav&gt; and make some use of it, it could deal with &lt;div 
type=nav&gt; as well.

&gt;<i> What is the fear of adding new tags?
</I>
Compatibility with older browsers. It should not be broken without due 
cause.

&gt;<i> You don't create a new XML document
</I>&gt;<i> with every tag as &lt;tag&gt; do you?
</I>
HTML isn't XML. Or, to the extent that it is XML (serialized as XML), it 
has a specific HTML vocabulary recognized by browsers and other 
HTML-aware software.

&gt;<i> They are backwards compatible in
</I>&gt;<i> that browsers that don't understand them can just ignore them.
</I>
That's exactly the point that causes the incompatibility: to a browser 
that does not recognize &lt;nav&gt; at all, your CSS settings for it are 
ignored and it isn't even rendered as a block by default.

&gt;<i> You can
</I>&gt;<i> use other elements within them in a transitional phase of your
</I>&gt;<i> development if you really think you need to.
</I>
So in any reasonable use now or some years from now, the new markup that 
was supposed to simplify markup will make markup more lengthy and less 
logical. Instead of
&lt;div class=nav&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
authors would need to use
&lt;nav&gt;&lt;div class=nav&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;
and they would have to do all the styling and scripting on the div element.
