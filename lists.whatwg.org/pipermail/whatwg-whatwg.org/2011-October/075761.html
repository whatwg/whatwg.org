It would also be nice if the page can keep rendering and running JS 
while the animation is running. Asynchronous dispatch would allow that.

Also ideally you'd want to dispatch the event after the animation is 
complete, so that the size of the document's view port is stable; if you 
dispatched the event before your animation is complete, the full-screen 
element's dimensions may not have reached the viewport size, and content 
might get confused, or at worst inconvenienced.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that &quot;being fullscreen&quot; is a property of the top-level

</I>&gt;<i> is the &quot;fullscreen element&quot;. If you have a document A with two

</I>&gt;<i> sure, there is no &quot;fullscreen element&quot; but it is definitely rendered 
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen.
</I>
As the proposed spec is written so far, I think Document.fullscreen is 
meant to convey that:

 1. If the document's full-screen element in the document, the
    full-screen element is rendered at viewport dimensions with browser
    UI hidden, or
 2. if the document's full-screen element is not in the document, the
    document is rendered at viewport dimensions.

The key is the  :full-screen psuedo-class, for which the suggested UA 
style rules enables the full-screen element appear to &quot;break out&quot; of 
containing frames and be rendered at the view-port size (assuming the 
browser window is made viewport dimensions by the UA).

The :full-screen pseudo-class is defined to also apply to &quot;an &lt;iframe&gt;, 
&lt;object&gt; or &lt;embed&gt; element whose child browsing context's Document is 
in the full-screen state&quot;. So if a child document in an iframe doesn't 
have its full-screen element in the document, unless the document 
reports being in full-screen state the :full-screen pseudo-class won't 
apply to that document, and that document thus won't be rendered at 
viewport dimensions.

If we specified a Document.currentFullScreenElement attribute, then 
Document.fullScreen would be equivalent to 
(Document.currentFullScreenElement != null).

Chris Pearce.
