<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Allowing authors to define an undoscope inside an editing host
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; troublesome because user editing actions can modify the subtree of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the host
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in very complex ways, and it's hard to understand which node may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mutated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a result of some editing actions or execCommand.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given that, I propose to ignore undoscope content attributes or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assignments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to undoScope IDL attribute if the content attribute is added to or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the IDL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute is set to true for an editable element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds reasonable. The content attribute should be made
</I>&gt;<i> non-conforming in that case. Perhaps the IDL attribute should throw
</I>&gt;<i> on setting? Maybe better to just do nothing, but that doesn't give
</I>&gt;<i> the author any idea of what's wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.
</I>
FWIW, I think we should throw in this case.

&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, I propose to continue to ignore undoscope content
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keep undoScope IDL attribute false when the element becomes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-editable in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the future (e.g. by removing contenteditable content attribute of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ancestor). Such a quirk is needed to avoid creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and destroying undoManager as a result of style recalculation in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mozilla and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WebKit because both engines support -webkit-user-modify and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -moz-user-modify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to toggle editability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds bad. To an author, it means that some element won't be an
</I>&gt;<i> undoscope for no discernible reason. I guess you just mean that
</I>&gt;<i> existing undoscope content attributes will be ignored, but if the
</I>&gt;<i> author sets the IDL or content attribute after the element is
</I>&gt;<i> editable, it will still work? It seems confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you intend to do if an element with the undoscope attribute
</I>&gt;<i> becomes editable? This could also happen due to style recalculation,
</I>&gt;<i> right? Are you not going to check in that case either, so it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible to get editable undoscopes after all?
</I>
I'm not sure if I understand the need for this quirk.

Firstly, FWIW, Gecko's implementation of -moz-user-modify does not allow content to use that attribute to make something contentEditable.  However, setting something to be editable changes the computed value for -moz-user-modify to read-write.  I don't really think that we would ever want to do the reverse, because of the problem that Aryeh mentions.  WebKit, however, seems to fully support -webkit-user-modify:read-write making something contentEditable.

&gt;<i> On my second thought, we probably don't need to do this. Since the
</I>&gt;<i> creation of UndoManager or undoscope isn't visible until the author
</I>&gt;<i> obtains the value of undoscope content attribute or undoScope IDL
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, we can probably destroy undoManager lazily.
</I>
I'm not sure I follow.

&gt;<i> It also means you can't support :read-write for contenteditable,
</I>&gt;<i> because that
</I>&gt;<i> would make selectors depend on style resolution. Is it just a
</I>&gt;<i> convenience measure so that you don't have to implement efficient
</I>&gt;<i> property inheritance a second time? Could you make the property
</I>&gt;<i> ignored in user stylesheets, at least, so that the only way authors
</I>&gt;<i> can make things editable is contenteditable/designMode?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to get rid of it but couldn't due to compat. issue. There are
</I>&gt;<i> too many applications that depend on -webkit-user-modify at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment.
</I>
Can you mention some examples?  These are applications which use -webkit-user-modify to make something editable.  However, they _should_ be using the contentEditable attribute in order for their to work on any other UA, right?

Cheers,
