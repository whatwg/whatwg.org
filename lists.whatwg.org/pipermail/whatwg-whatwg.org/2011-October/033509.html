a)
The fullscreen media query is missing (I seriously suggest supporting it)

# @media all and (full-screen) { /* ... */ }

Does it make sense to have on/off as in the Mozilla proposal ? e.g. &quot;and  
(full-screen:on/ff)&quot; ?

b)
I think that :fullscreen should not apply if there is no fullscreen  
element. It would make the CSS snippet simpler, and the media query would  
still allow fullscreen styles to be applied. It also allows the user agent  
 from optimize a bit to skip that fullscreen CSS snippet if there is no  
fullscreen element bound. And the CSS snippet as mentioned applies only to  
HTML, so another use case to have a media query.

c)
There should be a security note for request/cancel/enter/exitFullscreen  
that the user agent might choose to dishonor the calls to these methods,  
like if fullscreeen is not supported, or the browsing context is child of  
another one that does not allow fullscreen, or the call to these methods  
is not from a user initiated action. I would remark that user agents  
should ignore calls to those methods if not coming from a user initiated  
action (kind like the way pop ups are handled). So, the click to go  
fullscreen button use case works, but a webpage going fullscren during  
load and then spoof the browser UI would not. It would also make the use  
case for requestFullScreenWithKeys API less interesting.

d)
Perhaps a non normative note just to explain that the flags do would be  
nice for authors. fullscreen tells if the document is being rendered  
fullscreen (a shortcut to check if the media query applies), and  
fullscreenEnabled tells if the document is allowed to go fullscreen using  
the enter/requestFullscreen API.

e)
Given their use cases, the flag fullscreenEnabled would be better called  
fullscreenAllowed, and the fullscreen flag would be better called  
fullscreenEnabled.

So far, nice work.
