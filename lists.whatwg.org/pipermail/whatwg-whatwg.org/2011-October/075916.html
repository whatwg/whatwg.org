&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> The way selection is restored on WebKit after undoing selection is different
</I>&gt;<i> from the way it is done on Firefox and Internet Explorer.
</I>&gt;<i> Say you had &quot;hello world&quot; and &quot;world&quot; is deleted by an user. When the user
</I>&gt;<i> undoes the deletion, WebKit selects &quot;world&quot; whereas Firefox and Internet
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer do not select &quot;world&quot;. WebKit's behavior matches Mac's NSTextView
</I>&gt;<i> and we probably would like to keep the current behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> However, there's no easy way for the user agent to figure out whether a
</I>&gt;<i> given transaction wants to select some contents on undo or not.&#160;In fact, we
</I>&gt;<i> don't even know whether we want to restore selection at all. If an automatic
</I>&gt;<i> transaction was modifying non-text nodes (e.g. SVG line elements), then
</I>&gt;<i> restoring selection isn't desirable at all.
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of two approaches to solve this problem:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let automatic transactions also have unapply/reapply and call them after
</I>&gt;<i> user agents had done its work, and make the user agent do nothing in regards
</I>&gt;<i> to selection. We can name them afterUnapply/afterReapply if we want. The
</I>&gt;<i> benefit of this approach is that it's very general and authors can do other
</I>&gt;<i> things as well while the disadvantage being author needs to be fully aware
</I>&gt;<i> of platform-convention of how selection is restore upon undo/redo.
</I>
There are a couple of competing interests here:

  1.) simple content editable scenarios that don't involve a lot of
code should &quot;just work&quot; the way the underlying OS does
  2.) code-driven editing should be completely normalized by default
  3.) sophisticated code-driven editing will want to re-create
OS-native behavior

It seems like mixing #1 with #2 is what's causing the tension here. It
almost feels like if you add any custom commands, you need to replace
*all* of the default commands. Mix/match feels like the bug here. I
don't like the implications of that in terms of apparent code-size,
but I'm wondering how bad it really is.

&gt;<i> Add a boolean restoreSelection and isDeletion properties to the Transaction
</I>&gt;<i> interface. The user agent restores the selection when the value is true and
</I>&gt;<i> does not restore selection when the value is false. isDeletion is true when
</I>&gt;<i> the transaction is meant to delete contents and false otherwise. (Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> negate the property so that common case will be easy?) The user agents can
</I>&gt;<i> probably use some heuristics to determine whether a given transaction is
</I>&gt;<i> deleting contents or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't like either solution so I'm open to your ideas and thoughts on
</I>&gt;<i> this.
