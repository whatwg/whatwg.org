The problem is that if the undo manager has automatic transactions in them,
then they'll have references to nodes to undo/redo transactions. But those
nodes's owner document is still that of the old document. At least in
WebKit, this will be a bit of an issue.

I guess we can just slightly fail in those cases when transactions are
attempted to be undone or redone if you'd prefer that.

You're right. I got UndoManager on a detached node, UndoManager on an
adopted node, and the active undo manager all mixed up. It's fine to have
UndoManager on a detached node since it can never host the active undo
manager.

Note that the upcoming mutation observer spec makes no difference

</I>&gt;<i> undoManager uses the same backend, or is even built on top of it, then
</I>&gt;<i> things will just automatically work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I thought about implementing UndoManager on top of new DOM mutation observer
API, but the asynchronous nature of new notification API makes it a little
hard, if not impossible, to implement UndoManager's synchronous API
correctly.

I think there is a lot of value in allowing a element to be moved
&gt;<i> around in a document. Even when that element, or a descendant of it,
</I>&gt;<i> has a undoManager attached.

Agreed.
