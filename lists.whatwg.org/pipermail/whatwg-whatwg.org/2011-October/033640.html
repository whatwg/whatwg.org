&gt;<i> New elements like &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; have the problem that some existing

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt; markup that you use in addition to &lt;nav&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, it would be much simpler, for compatibility with existing user
</I>&gt;<i> agents, to use just &lt;div type=nav&gt; and &lt;div type=footer&gt;. Such elements can
</I>&gt;<i> be styled at will, and if any browsers or search engines wish to recognize
</I>&gt;<i> semantic markup, type=nav should not be a bigger problem than &lt;nav&gt;, rather
</I>&gt;<i> smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that this should have been suggested years ago. But I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> think of the issue, and it seems that neither did anyone else, aloud. And
</I>&gt;<i> it's not too late, is it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody needs new elements with no required functionality, really. The idea
</I>&gt;<i> of more compact markup is pointless. People don't read or write markup that
</I>&gt;<i> much, and if they do, &lt;div type=nav&gt; is no less semantic than &lt;nav&gt;. But the
</I>&gt;<i> latter has the serious drawback of being ignored by many relevant user
</I>&gt;<i> agents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It does not need to be the 'type' attribute of course. That attribute name
</I>&gt;<i> is seriously overloaded, so 'kind' might be better. The important thing is
</I>&gt;<i> to introduce an attribute different from 'class', which currently lets
</I>&gt;<i> authors use a free naming space. We don't want to interfere with style
</I>&gt;<i> sheets that might use this or that 'class' attribute value; instead, a new
</I>&gt;<i> attribute name (defined as semantic, not presentational, but still useful
</I>&gt;<i> for styling) is called for - rather than new element names, which are born
</I>&gt;<i> homeless.
</I>
Believe me, these discussions were had in the past.

All major UAs except old IE handle unknown elements in a way that's
acceptable for &lt;nav&gt; and friends.  They have the absolute default
styling (such as display:inline), but that's fine, as you can still
target them and restyle them.

In old IE the new elements are instead parsed as two void elements
named &quot;&lt;nav&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;/nav&gt;&quot;, but the IE shiv has been around for years
now that fixes that with a one-liner in JS.  Once you run that, you're
in the same situation as other major browsers.

So, it's not a big deal.  (Plus, modern browsers *do* recognize the
new elements natively now.)
