<PRE>Le Wed, 15 Mar 2006 07:52:28 +0200, Alexey Feldgendler  
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">alexey at feldgendler.ru</A>&gt; a &#233;crit:

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> Sandboxes are quite special things, so we'll need a DOMSandbox anyway.  
</I>&gt;<i> But instead of adding things like getElementById() to the DOMSandbox  
</I>&gt;<i> interface, I tend to make the &quot;fake document&quot; which is visible from  
</I>&gt;<i> inside the sandbox a member of the sandbox itself. The call will look  
</I>&gt;<i> like sandbox.document.getElementById().
</I>
As Ric said, having &lt;sandbox&gt;es treated &quot;too similar&quot; to a document is  
overkill.

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i> Again, good point, but this is not entirely related to &quot;duplicate ID as  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a security issue&quot;. Meaning, you are advocating for the &lt;sandbox&gt;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> element. That's something I also do, depending the way it's going to be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined (of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, really. I've actually gave the wrong subject to the thread. It  
</I>&gt;<i> should have been titled &quot;Sandboxing can make contained HTML harmless in  
</I>&gt;<i> more ways than just isolating scripts&quot;.
</I>
True.

&gt;&gt;<i> The &lt;sandbox&gt; element would make securing a web application from common  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security holes and other pitfalls much easier and elegant. Of course,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would also solve the duplicate IDs issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, now it seems the only solution to me because, as you say  
</I>&gt;<i> below, the behavior on duplicate IDs cannot be changed to a safe way  
</I>&gt;<i> without breaking backwaard compatibility.
</I>
That's what I was also thinking, after I wrote the email. You can't really  
do much about duplicate IDs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Returning to the duplicate IDs, I think we should define some standard  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> behavior for getElementById() when there is more than one element with  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the given ID. To lower the possible extent of duplicate ID attacks, I  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> propose that getElementById() should throw an exception in that case.  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's better to crash the script than to make it do what the attacker  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bad idea. [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Point is, web applications currently do rely on duplicate IDs support.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Throwing errors (thus breaking scripts) also badly breaks backwards  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compatibility. That web application is not the only one having such  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> badly coded backend, it's one of many (look at most corporate web sites  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done in &quot;a snap&quot; by &quot;gurus&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if browsers did throw exceptions on duplicate IDs, there wouldn't  
</I>&gt;<i> be any duplicate IDs in existing applications. The problem is that there  
</I>&gt;<i> are already such applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A wild thought: maybe enforce ID uniqueness only for &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;?)
</I>
I always advocate for maximum possible strictness in &quot;standards compliance  
mode&quot; rendering. UAs should break all &quot;standards compliant&quot; pages with  
very big and fat warnings &quot;error!!!&quot;. But ... sadly, as I see it, the line  
between quirks mode and standards mode is blurring. I would love if major  
UAs (mainly Opera and Firefox) would provide a way to be *extremely*  
strict.

I think enforcing ID uniqueness in standards mode would be good, but that  
would still probably break (very?) few pages. Those web authors should  
have to &quot;live with it&quot;, because they want standards-compliant sites.

Side note and wild guess: We are probably forgeting that the beauty of the  
web is actually allowing everyone to contribute, be it bad code or better  
code. Wanting something *that* strict is like disproving one of the  
essential concepts contributing to the success of the web.

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> Someone could post a JavaScript game in his blog, a horoscope calculator  
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, by the way, blog entries aren't the only place where sandboxing can  
</I>&gt;<i> be appliied in blogs. For example, LiveJournal allows user-defined  
</I>&gt;<i> journal styles which are written by the users in a self-invented  
</I>&gt;<i> programming language which outputs HTML. That HTML goes through the HTML  
</I>&gt;<i> cleaner afterwards, of course. Manny people would love to add dynamic  
</I>&gt;<i> menus, AJAX comments folding etc to their styles. This could be partly  
</I>&gt;<i> solved with a set of predefined &quot;toys&quot;, but actually the entire  
</I>&gt;<i> LiveJournal styling system is about user-initiated development. Those  
</I>&gt;<i> with programming skills write new styles, and other users may take and  
</I>&gt;<i> use them.
</I>
I did not see LiveJournal, so I don't know what kind of features they  
offer.

&lt;sandbox&gt; would probably do &quot;the trick&quot; (would help a lot with security in  
this case also).

I have some doubts about how &lt;sandbox&gt; would turn out when used by masses.

Take HTML, for example, it's a markup language greatly appreciated by many  
and despised by others. Even you said in one reply to this thread &quot;today's  
HTML sucks&quot; - advocating for the need of allowing user-scripts in pages,  
for having table sorting, popup menus, etc. A few minutes later in another  
reply you say &quot;we already have a great markup language, which is HTML&quot; -  
advocating for allowing users to write HTML, instead of custom markup.

So, &lt;sandbox&gt; may be designed to help tighting-up security on the web, but  
we should also try to think of how's it actually in usage, side-effects,  
etc. It definitely solves problems, but will it cause other problems? How  
important are they?
