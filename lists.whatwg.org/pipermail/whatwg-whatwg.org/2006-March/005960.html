<PRE>On Sun, 14 Aug 2005, Henri Sivonen wrote:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; must start an NCR or an entity reference as in XML. (Rationale: Lone &amp; 
</I>&gt;<i> likely a mistake anyway.)
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> &amp;apos; is not considered conforming. (Rationale: Did not exist in HTML4 and is
</I>&gt;<i> not supported by IE)
</I>
Disagreed. Consistency on XML seems like a very good thing here. I've also 
added AMP, COPY, LT, GT, QUOT and REG for compatibility, and made them 
conformant. It seems like those would be useful in all-caps text.


&gt;<i> Entity references and NCRs have to be terminated explicitly with a 
</I>&gt;<i> semicolon. (Rationale: Implicit termination is likely a mistake unless 
</I>&gt;<i> the person who wrote the reference is an SGML pedant. Requiring the 
</I>&gt;<i> semicolon makes things unambiguous for sure. Also, having an explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> delimiter helps in avoiding lookahead/pushback in the parser.)
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> Astral non-characters are not banned. (They are not banned in XML 1.0, 
</I>&gt;<i> either.)
</I>
The only character that get dropped in the spec are U+0000 and U+000D 
(the latter having special processing converting some of them to U+000A). 
So I agree, I guess, unless I misunderstood your comment.


&gt;<i> Unescaped &lt; and &gt; in attributes are allowed without warning despite 
</I>&gt;<i> folklore that warns about this breaking unspecified legacy UAs.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> Unquoted attribute values must be of the form [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is slightly restrictive in a semi-arbitrary way for implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> convenience.
</I>
Disagreed. Unquoted attribute value syntax is pretty lax in the spec... 
also for implementation convenience. :-)


&gt;<i> The elements script and style are treated as CDATA. The string &quot;&lt;/&quot; may 
</I>&gt;<i> only occur as part of the end tag. (Rationale: This approach is both 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with SGML and the way browsers work. Also, this avoids 
</I>&gt;<i> lookahead/lookback.)
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> PIs are banned. As are marked sections.
</I>
Agreed. They both end up forming bogus comments.


&gt;<i> Doctypes with the SYSTEM id only are banned.
</I>&gt;<i> The internal subset is banned.
</I>&gt;<i> The HTML5 doctype passes silently.
</I>&gt;<i> The HTML 4.01 Strict and Transitional doctypes cause a warning about the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5-centric nature of the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> Doctypes whose public id starts with &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML &quot; are banned with a
</I>&gt;<i> special message.
</I>&gt;<i> Other doctypes are treated as errors as is the lack of a doctype.
</I>&gt;<i> The lack of a system id in the HTML 4.01 Transitional doctype is treated as an
</I>&gt;<i> error.
</I>&gt;<i> The lack of a system id in the HTML 4.01 Strict doctype causes a warning even
</I>&gt;<i> though the spec says &quot;must&quot; and gives a doctype with a system id.
</I>&gt;<i> Failure to use the canonical system ids cause warnings even though the &quot;must&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> in HTML 4.01 could be interpreted as banning these.
</I>
DOCTYPEs other than &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; (case-insensitive) all cause parse 
errors, and may trigger quirks mode.


&gt;<i> The internal character encoding information is not passed to the 
</I>&gt;<i> application as content for consistency with the XML declaration, which 
</I>&gt;<i> is not exposed through the SAX2 ContentHandler.
</I>
Nothing special is done for this.


&gt;<i> The BOM is sniffed.
</I>&gt;<i> The lack of character encoding information (including the BOM) is treated as a
</I>&gt;<i> fatal error.
</I>
This part of the spec needs work.


&gt;<i> &gt; But I haven't thought much about this yet. The way parsing is to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defined I expect to just say &quot;parsers should do this, and if they hit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this they should do this, and if they hit this it's an error and they 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should do this&quot;, with confomance checkers having to do the same but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reporting the errors. If that makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My parser is (almost) Draconian, so I don't intend to implement the 
</I>&gt;<i> elaborate error recovery that is needed for browsers. (I have no 
</I>&gt;<i> interest in competing with John Cowan's TagSoup.)
</I>
The spec explains how to recover from parse errors, but doesn't require 
recovery from conformance checkers.
