Yeah, I haven't really thought these through yet.

Here are some of the things I'm worried about:

 * It should be possible for scripts to add content to placeholder 
   elements without those placeholder elements being non-conformant.
   This is a very useful programming idiom, not least of which because
   adding content to an existing element (whether attributes or child
   nodes) is a lot easier than adding the element in the first place.

 * It should be possible to have a group of pages that have a similar 
   structure, with elements annotated as necessary. For example, a menu
   list could be the same on each page, but with the currently loaded
   page simply not having the &quot;href&quot; attribute on its link, or some such.

 * It should always be clear from a semantic point of view whether the
   content is a single &quot;paragraph&quot;, or whether it is a group of 
   paragraphs.


&gt;<i> To make document conformance a more useful concept for the purpose of catching
</I>&gt;<i> author errors, I suggest that the following attributes be made required:
</I>&gt;<i> href and rel on link
</I>&gt;<i> href on base
</I>&gt;<i> name and content on meta (other than the encoding decl)
</I>&gt;<i> src on img
</I>&gt;<i> code, height and width on applet
</I>&gt;<i> name and value on param
</I>
I've made a note of this in the draft so I don't lose track of it. Your 
proposals make sense on the whole. Exceptions: &lt;base target&gt; may mean that 
&lt;base&gt; should have either href or target. &lt;img&gt; might be a placeholder, 
I'm still considering exactly what we want with that one.


&gt;<i> To allow user agents see whether the author provided the empty string as the
</I>&gt;<i> alternative text of whether the author just didn't care, I suggest that the
</I>&gt;<i> alt attribute on img be made optional.
</I>
I agree.


&gt;<i> Since sectional elements are document-oriented rather than Web 
</I>&gt;<i> application-oriented, it seems to me it would make sense to require them 
</I>&gt;<i> to contain one or more block elements as opposed to zero or more.
</I>
You can have empty sections. They might not be written yet, for instance.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, I have doubts about the requirement of significant 
</I>&gt;<i> inline content. When the W3C said that paragraphs mustn't be empty, 
</I>&gt;<i> various applications started emitting &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;. If the WHAT WG says 
</I>&gt;<i> that paragraphs must contend significant inline content, are the 
</I>&gt;<i> developers of those applications suddenly going to decide not to allow 
</I>&gt;<i> them to paragraphs to be saved or are they going to come up with an even 
</I>&gt;<i> more crufty work-around to comply with the machine-checkable 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements of the spec?
</I>
I agree. I think I'll remove mention of the &quot;significant inline content&quot; 
concept.
