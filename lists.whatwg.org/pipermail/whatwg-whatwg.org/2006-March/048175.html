&gt;&gt;<i> What is or what isn't technically simple to implement in existing

</I>
Only the innermost one does. I've posted the exact rules a couple of weeks  
ago.

&gt;&gt;<i>  It is also clear that it hasn't been exactly been required by  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet, so it is likely that an implementation doesn't have it already.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it involves storing more information, implementing it is likely to cost  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in terms of memory use.
</I>
In Gecko, as far as I can see from its source code, it doesn't add memory  
overhead. It already has origin tracking of some kind (used to implement  
the today's usual security restrictions).

&gt;&gt;<i> why doesn't the author simply make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure to serve the untrusted content from another server (with another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> host name or port number, that is, not necessarily another machine)?
</I>
This is what LiveJournal does now. However:
1. For many small sites it's not an option,
2. It doesn't solve the problem of untrusted JS included by a page.

&gt;&gt;<i> Seems that brings another (although simpler) set of problems though:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what if the untrusted content contains a &quot;&lt;/SANDBOX&gt;&quot; tag, or if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ends with &quot;&lt;!--&quot;, or possibly other syntax anomalies?
</I>
I never said that the website won't have to do HTML cleaning for  
user-supplied content. But with HTML 5 reference parsing algorithm, such  
cleaning is going to be much easier and straightforward: parse the text  
into DOM (as if it was inside BODY, for example), remove or modify  
forbidden elements, then serialize it. That way, &lt;/SANDBOX&gt; will be  
ignored as an easy parse error because it doesn't match an opening tag  
within the user-supplied text. An unclosed comment will be ignored, too.

&gt;&gt;<i> What if it doesn't contain exactly that, but something else that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> triggers equivalent behaviour in the HTML parser in some implementation?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML parser are traditionally quite complex, and quite &quot;fuzzy&quot;.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fuzziness hasn't been a security problem before, now all of a sudden it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be.
</I>
HTML 5 will make HTML parsing in standards mode well-defined, with  
predictable error recovery.

&gt;<i> Did we discuss how the UA should handle a closing &lt;/sandbox&gt; tag?
</I>&gt;<i> Would it need to scan forward in the markup to find other closing
</I>&gt;<i> tags and determine if the current one is a part of the enclosed
</I>&gt;<i> markup or the end of the SANDBOX in that page? Perhaps only the first
</I>&gt;<i> and the last SANDBOX open/close tags can be taken into account and
</I>&gt;<i> others discarded?
</I>
No need to do that. SANDBOX elements can be nested like many others.  
Nevertheless, a &lt;/SANDBOX&gt; tag without a matching opening tag inside the  
user-supplied content will be ignored during the HTML cleanup process  
described above.

There is one more such case: when &lt;/SANDBOX&gt; is injected using  
document.write(&quot;&lt;/SANDBOX&gt;&quot;), but that can be easily circumvented.
