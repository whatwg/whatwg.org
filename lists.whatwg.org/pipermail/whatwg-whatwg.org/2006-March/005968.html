</I>
Yes, conformant documents will be such that a conformant HTML5 document 
can always be serialised to a conforming XHTML5 document, I think. If that 
ever turns out not to be the case, please raise the issue! I think this is 
important because people use XML tools then serialise to HTML, and vice 
versa (e.g. with CMSes that store data in custom formats).


&gt;<i> &gt; For example, the list of characters that must be recognised as part of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an element or attribute name when hitting an unknown element or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute is bigger than the list of characters XML allows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the purpose of conformance checking, I've gone the other way and 
</I>&gt;<i> limited names to ASCII. I think that's OK, because conforming names are 
</I>&gt;<i> ASCII. However, I expect that I will have to polish the code that looks 
</I>&gt;<i> for unquoted attribute values. (But I think conforming unquoted 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute values should not include values that weren't SGML-valid in 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 4.)
</I>
As specced, unquoted values can contain pretty much anything.


&gt;<i> &gt; Similarly, a comment in HTML can contain the string &quot;--&quot; (assuming it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comes in pairs), while an XML comment cannot. This latter example even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; affects conforming documents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From the HTML-as-SGML point of view, there are two comments in &lt;!-- foo 
</I>&gt;<i> -- -- bar -- &gt;, so it would be quite appropriate to convert it into XML 
</I>&gt;<i> as &lt;!-- foo --&gt;&lt;!-- bar --&gt;. This reasoning does not quite work for 
</I>&gt;<i> faithfully converting HTML-as-soup.
</I>
That's certainly one way to handle it.


&gt;<i> &gt; I've been looking at misnested tags recently (hence my replying to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this e-mail despite normally archiving the e-mails about HTML parsing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so that I can get back to them when I start work on that part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec). I assume, based on the line of reasoning that you've been 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; describing above, that you would agree with me that we should forego 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatibility with IE in the DOM it forms in response to markup such 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;body&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; TEXT NODE &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What IE does in this case is make the TEXT NODE's parent be the &lt;div&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and its previous sibling be the &lt;form&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What browsers do tends to vary; but with markup such as the above 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Firefox and Safari interoperate on saying that the &lt;/form&gt; is ignored 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the form instead continues up to the &lt;/body&gt;. However, the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposite:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;body&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; TEXT NODE &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...does not do the opposite in those browsers, despite (in IE) the DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being equivalent to the previous case. Here, the &lt;/div&gt; is not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignored, it implies the &lt;/form&gt; and the TEXT NODE ends up a child of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;body&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is reasonable to force the DOM into a tree, which necessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> means not doing what IE does in some cases.
</I>
Agreed. In the case above, I've gone with IE's closing of &lt;form&gt;, so the 
rendering would be more IE-compatible, but the DOM is a tree.


&gt;<i> Also, I think a conformance checker should only have to observe the top 
</I>&gt;<i> of the open element stack when deciding what to do with an end tag. That 
</I>&gt;<i> is, popping due to non-matching end tag would always be opportunistic 
</I>&gt;<i> (possibly leading to an error if a matching start is not found).
</I>
Yeah, I think the way the spec is defined you can implement a conformance 
checker without looking anywhere but the end of the stack. But you'd only 
be able to catch one error at a time.


&gt;<i> However, I assume there may be non-conforming cases where browsers would 
</I>&gt;<i> want to peek deeper in the stack before deciding whether to discard a 
</I>&gt;<i> misnested end tag or pop until the start tag is found (ie. only pop if 
</I>&gt;<i> the start was actually found when peeking deeper in the stack). 
</I>&gt;<i> Additional testing and/or reading of source would be needed for 
</I>&gt;<i> determining if such deep peeking is happening here or if popping the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'form' on &lt;/div&gt; is opportunistic. (But &lt;/form&gt; apparently causes 
</I>&gt;<i> neither deep peeking nor opportunistic popping.)
</I>
There are cases where you have to do surgery to the middle of the stack. 
So yeah, full implementations would have a lot more work to do.


&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to work out all the various cases is giving me a headache...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I hope you sympathize with my selfish desire to get conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> checkers exempt from error recovery (ie. allowing them to stop upon 
</I>&gt;<i> finding an error).
</I>
Hey, now that I've done the work, I want y'all to suffer too. :-P
