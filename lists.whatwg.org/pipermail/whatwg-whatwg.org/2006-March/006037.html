<PRE>Le Thu, 16 Mar 2006 13:45:54 +0200, Alexey Feldgendler  
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">alexey at feldgendler.ru</A>&gt; a &#233;crit:

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> A DOMDocument interface has to be exposed to the contained scripts  
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, ahy not also make it accessible from the outside?
</I>
Yes, but I'm afraid it's a technical challenge to implementors. Their  
browser engines might need some rewrites to properly support &lt;sandbox&gt;ing  
content. Therefore, instead of rewrites, they'll hack the &lt;sandbox&gt;es,  
opening a wide variety of security holes competing for the crown of &quot;the  
first web virus&quot;.

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> I'm not speaking about enforcing ID uniqueness at the time of parsing  
</I>&gt;<i> the page, but only at the time of calling getElementById(). I believe it  
</I>&gt;<i> will break very few pages, if any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that many web applications have bugs like this: they have a CSS  
</I>&gt;<i> rule like &quot;#titlebar { font-weight: bold; }&quot; and a single titlebar on  
</I>&gt;<i> the page. After that, the requirements change, and they have more than  
</I>&gt;<i> one titlebar on a page. To make the rule apply to all titlebars, they  
</I>&gt;<i> give them all the same ID (instead of using class, not ID, in CSS  
</I>&gt;<i> rules). While such documents are non-connforming, they should not, in my  
</I>&gt;<i> opinion, cause parse errors even in standards mode. Here is why:  
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate IDs are wrong, but it's obvious what the author means, and  
</I>&gt;<i> it's easy to do &quot;what the author intended&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Usually in such applications the scripts don't call getElementById() for  
</I>&gt;<i> those ID values which occur more than once. If they occasionally do,  
</I>&gt;<i> it's really a programming bug. I don't believe that there are  
</I>&gt;<i> applications that really rely on the particular behavior in this case,  
</I>&gt;<i> though I admit that there are possibly some that have this bug unnoticed  
</I>&gt;<i> and still work. I think that this case should trigger an exception in  
</I>&gt;<i> standards mode because, for this bug, there is no obvious fix to apply,  
</I>&gt;<i> and we don't know &quot;what the author meant&quot; -- does he want to do  
</I>&gt;<i> something to the first element with the specified ID, the second, or  
</I>&gt;<i> both.
</I>
Under no way should this happen. This is adding confusion to an already  
over-confused web author (as in: a web author who doesn't know much web  
development).

Therefore, it's clear nothing has to be changed in quirks mode, but in  
standards mode:

1. break during parsing.
2. break JS code if it sets the id of a node to a duplicate ID.

Or simply leave it as it is: quirks mode behaviour.

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> Simply picking the last matching node is actually hiding a bug and  
</I>&gt;<i> letting it go unnoticed. (Why the last one? Why not the first, for  
</I>&gt;<i> example?)
</I>
That's true, but this happens in many, many other cases.

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i> I did not see LiveJournal, so I don't know what kind of features they  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;sandbox&gt; would probably do &quot;the trick&quot; (would help a lot with security  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in this case also).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think so. Actually, my activity around the sandboxing idea has  
</I>&gt;<i> been inspired by several recent security incidents with LiveJournal and  
</I>&gt;<i> its styling system which failed to filter out some patterns of dangerous  
</I>&gt;<i> HTML.
</I>
True. As you said, there are risks with buggy &lt;sandbox&gt; implementations,  
but that's an advantage actually: relying on browser fixes, instead of  
site-by-site fixes. I prefer to get a single patch from the implementor,  
than wait for hundreds of sites to fix them. Yet, this is an advantage to  
malicious users too: distribution of the &quot;virus&quot;/exploit can be very  
powerful and fast.

&lt;...&gt;
&gt;<i> Yeah, really, I sound a bit contradictory. Actually, in my opinion, HTML  
</I>&gt;<i> is better than most of ad-hoc markup languages, and HTML with scripts is  
</I>&gt;<i> still better than just HTML.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i> And another thing: HTML 5 is about to make HTML pages more powerful,  
</I>&gt;<i> there are going to be menus, datagrids and such, but most of these  
</I>&gt;<i> features are useless without scripting, aren't they? For example, a  
</I>&gt;<i> datagrid isn't really sortable at client side without a script, which  
</I>&gt;<i> makes it useless in blogs and CMS unless they allow some scripting.
</I>
True.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, &lt;sandbox&gt; may be designed to help tighting-up security on the web,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but we should also try to think of how's it actually in usage,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side-effects, etc. It definitely solves problems, but will it cause  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other problems? How important are they?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there is a lot more to think and talk about. I suppose there  
</I>&gt;<i> are going to be problems with particular buggy implementations of  
</I>&gt;<i> sandboxing and exploits specifically targetted at holes in such  
</I>&gt;<i> implementations. I suspect that web application authors and site  
</I>&gt;<i> administrators will be hesitant to allow user scripting even in  
</I>&gt;<i> sandboxes because of the possible browser bugs. Though, because  
</I>&gt;<i> sandboxes can be useful even if scripting inside them is completely  
</I>&gt;<i> disallowed, I hope that the use of sandboxes becomes somewhat popular  
</I>&gt;<i> even before site administrators decide to allow scripting.
</I>
True, but I'd test. If it works in major browsers as I want, then why not?  
Especially in the case of intranet web applications.
