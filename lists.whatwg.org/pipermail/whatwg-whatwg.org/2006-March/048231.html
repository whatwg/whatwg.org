Valid HTML5 with what semantics? The same as &lt;foo&gt;? In which case, what's 
the advantage?

I mean, we could make

   &lt;foo !!&gt;

...valid as well, but I don't see any good reason to do it.

In fact, it seems that we don't want to make &lt;p/&gt; valid (and mean &lt;p&gt;) 
since that would just be REALLY confusing to authors using HTML5 and 
XHTML5 interchangeably.


&gt;<i> Any parser which doesn't support &lt;foo /&gt; also doesn't support much of 
</I>&gt;<i> the web content produced in the last 2 years.
</I>
Certainly the HTML5 spec says that &lt;foo /&gt; must be treated as &lt;foo&gt; (and 
&lt;p/&gt; as &lt;p&gt;), but that doesn't mean we have to make it valid.


&gt;<i> In this case a conformance checker could emit a warning (maybe only a 
</I>&gt;<i> strict warning) since it's not impossible that people will expect HTML5 
</I>&gt;<i> to work in a parser that's incompatible with real-world HTML4.
</I>
According to the spec as it stands now, conformance checkers must report 
it as a parse error, and implementations that don't do error checking must 
simply ignore the &quot;/&quot;.

Agreed (and done).

Agreed, with the caveat that the spec can give requirements for things it 
says aren't valid, so the two aren't always mutually exclusive.


&gt;<i> There have been discussions about redefining the low-level parsing of

</I>&gt;<i> validate as HTML which is a drag. If you want to be able to serve the 
</I>&gt;<i> same content as both HTML and XHTML, you would want to make sure that it 
</I>&gt;<i> validates as both HTML and XHTML.)
</I>
I'm not sure it would be a good idea to have the tokeniser know which 
elements it should allow trailing &quot;/&quot; characters for. That seems like a 
lot of work for no strong immediate benefit.
