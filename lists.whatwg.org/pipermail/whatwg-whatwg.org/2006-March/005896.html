DreamHost does have cvs, so putting it in CVS is straightforward and quite easy.
Making the diffs available would be harder: DreamHost only allows access over
ssh, so anonymous access isn't possible. Bonsai could one option. Another would
be to make CVS mail the diffs to an archived announcement list, and that's
probably easier to set up quickly.

I would appreciate CVS diffs, too.
