Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.

I've specced out an initial draft for &lt;meter&gt;:

   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#meter0">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#meter0</A>

It's a bit complicated because of having to deal with all of mpt's ideas 
while still supporting all of the min/max/good/bad stuff, but I think it's 
a good compromise in design. It only handles one, two, or three segments 
(good, good/bad, bad/good, good/bad/worse, bad/good/bad, or worse/bad/ 
good). I think that covers more than 90% of the use cases for this, but if 
people feel their use case isn't being covered, please speak up now.

Yeah. I've gone with &lt;meter&gt; for now, but if anyone comes up with 
something substantially better, or can demonstrate that their idea is 
definitely better (e.g. with stats on how authors can't spell &lt;meter&gt; but 
can spell &lt;gauge&gt;) then I'll change it.

&lt;readout&gt; might work... What do other people think? Is &lt;readout&gt; better 
than &lt;meter&gt;? Might have fewer typos, but's longer, and might be confused 
with &lt;samp&gt; (&quot;why does it show a graph??&quot;).

That's for progress indicators, which is a separate element (different 
semantics).

See:

   <A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-September/002211.html">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-September/002211.html</A>

Basically, they have substantially different UIs. Progress meters indicate 
change, and gauges indicate a state. They look different, they act 
different, and at the end of the day, they are different semantics.

It's not a matter of people misspelling it in their finished documents, 
it's a matter of usability. If you keep misspelling the tag name and then 
fixing it, you're going to waste a lot of time. If we can avoid the entire 
problem by reducing the total number of typos, we'll save the human race 
many minutes of wasted life, reduce stress, and increase the amount of 
time that Web devs can spend with their kids. :-)
