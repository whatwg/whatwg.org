well ATM I'm just looking through the sources familiarizing myself. 
attaching a form element (apart from a submit button) to an arbitrary 
form looks relatively simple as the relationship for form submission is 
separate to the DOM. but I'm only working from the 1.5 source at the mo 
(i wanted to get *a* build together). Will do CVS next but like i said, 
i'm not really expecting my changes to make it into the trunk, but i 
suppose there's no harm in asking... someone got PING in there after all.
