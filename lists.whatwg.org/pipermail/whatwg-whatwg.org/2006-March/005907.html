Then why mention them at all? That seems like dog-whistling.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He strongly disproves of not being able to style scrollbars, buttons

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People will always want to do so. Native rendering won't suffice. Some 
</I>&gt;<i> designers hate seeing native buttons, inputs, selects and whatever.
</I>
And they can continue to implement and/or style controls, and pay the 
cost of having less usable sites, just as they do now; with the browser 
vendors saving the Web authors from themselves, to the extent the 
people using the browsers desire, just as they do now.

&gt;<i> If the specifications won't give them the proper ways to style them, 
</I>&gt;<i> we'll see quite many annoying hacks of the future.
</I>
I think the sum (annoyance &#10005; popularity) of those hacks will be less 
than the sum (annoyance &#10005; popularity) of fully stylable menus would be. 
You think the reverse. I think that's the real disagreement here, and 
we can't prove it one way or the other.

&gt;<i> Developers are making the switch to CSS layouts, departing away from 
</I>&gt;<i> table layouts. Now is the time for CSS to evolve and give them all the 
</I>&gt;<i> power they want.
</I>
Non sequitur fallacy. Actually, two of them. First, that more people 
are using CSS does not necessarily mean CSS should &quot;evolve and give 
them all the power they want&quot;. (Such a process would probably lead to 
something as unwieldy as XHTML 2.) Second, even if CSS should &quot;evolve 
and give [developers] all the power they want&quot;, that would not 
necessarily mean that &lt;command icon= should be part of CSS.

Do you have any specific reason for wanting &lt;command icon= to be part 
of CSS? I'm not thoroughly opposed to the idea, it just seems very 
inconvenient. Most icons will be used for only one menu item, so the 
&quot;you don't have to repeat yourself&quot; argument for using CSS doesn't 
apply. In that respect it's quite similar to &lt;object src=.

&gt;<i> I wouldn't personally like seeing a new menu for each web app, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that's the way it goes.
</I>
Slippery slope fallacy. Currently, Web authors who want menus in HTML 
either (a) misuse &lt;select&gt; with script, or (b) implement their own with 
positioned elements and script. Introducing a third option, (c) use 
&lt;command&gt; and related elements, won't increase the proportion of Web 
developers using (b)! It certainly won't result in &quot;each Web app&quot; using 
(b).

&gt;<i> Leave open doors for ugly hacks or not?
</I>
False dilemma fallacy. There is no &quot;or not&quot;: HTML 5 doesn't, and can't, 
prevent Web authors from continuing to use the ugly hacks they're 
already using (except to cry &quot;non-conformant!&quot; and let slip the dogs of 
validation). What it can, and does, do is offer better alternatives to 
those hacks.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> I almost can hear a web developer &quot;ugh .... that's ugly!!!&quot; (seeing 
</I>&gt;<i> the menus natively rendered).
</I>
And he or she has to put up with such vomitous native controls in every 
menu and every dialog of Dreamweaver, too! The poor thing.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then do what native application developers do in the same situation, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when they want to be gratuitously inconsistent with the rest of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform: implement your own menu controls. &lt;...&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True. I myself don't like scrollbar colors being changed just because 
</I>&gt;<i> the designer of the site wanted so. It's annoying.
</I>
So the anecdote of the na&#239;ve guy above was more dog-whistling?

&gt;<i> You either: agree, embrace or disagree with diversity.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
I suspect that's another false dilemma, but to be honest I'm not even 
sure what you're saying. :-)
