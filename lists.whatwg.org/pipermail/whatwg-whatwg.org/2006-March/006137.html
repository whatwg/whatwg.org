Did you actually mean 0.25?

Currently, this:

   &lt;meter value=&quot;0.25&quot;&gt;400k / 16,000k&lt;/meter&gt;

...will show a 25% meter, and this:

   &lt;meter&gt;400k / 16,000k&lt;/meter&gt;

...will show a 2.5% meter.

Assuming you meant 2.5%, I think that's a great example of why in fact not 
requiring the attribute is a good thing.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;meter id=&quot;themeter&quot;&gt;&lt;/meter&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> eMeter.value = fUploaded / fTotal;
</I>&gt;<i> eMeter.innerHTML = fUploaded + &quot;k / &quot; + fTotal + &quot;k&quot;;
</I>
The way the spec is defined now, you don't even need to update .value. You 
can just update .textContent and that's enough to make it work.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The only difference between meter and progress is the potential for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; progress to be dynamic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's a big difference. It means the UI for one has to show that it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is static, and the UI for the other has to show that it should &quot;end&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is laudable, and makes sense, but each will be updatable on the 
</I>&gt;<i> fly. a meter has to have this ability, e.g. allowing CNN to show the 
</I>&gt;<i> election votes cast on their home page, updated asynchronously. and with 
</I>&gt;<i> that ability will come authors who use one exclusively, merely applying 
</I>&gt;<i> style sheet rules (&lt;meter class=&quot;votes&quot;&gt;), or use either in place of the 
</I>&gt;<i> other ad hoc, depending on their styling rules. thus there's no way that 
</I>&gt;<i> a UA can be forced to show that a progress indicator is, indeed, 
</I>&gt;<i> progressing.
</I>
Sure. But at least if authors want to do the right thing, they can, which 
they couldn't if we only provided one element.

</I>
Those are indeterminate progress bars, also supported by the current 
spec. But mpt didn't mean that; in Mac OS X, the progress bars have a 
subtly animated texture that indicates the direction of progress.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what about number in other languages ?
</I>
Most languages use 0-9. In fact I'm not aware of any that actually use 
other digits to report progress. However, my experience is limited. Could 
you point me to example sites that use other numbers to show progress or 
to show a meter level or report a measurement?


&gt;<i> So why not forcing use of &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; element for numbers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;progress&gt;&lt;m&gt;30&lt;/m&gt; out of &lt;m&gt;45&lt;/m&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> in that case m has to be a number in whatever encoding even in RTL it 
</I>&gt;<i> will be parsable
</I>
As currently defined, RTL actually works. I don't want to force the user 
of an element if it isn't required. (You can use an element, though, 
indeed one of the examples uses a &lt;span&gt; element like that.)

</I>
Well, if you provide the value=&quot;&quot; attribute, the content just gets 
ignored, so that's already supported.


&gt;<i> This seems like another situation where there needs to be only one,

</I>
It just seems like in almost all the examples people have given so far, 
the code is simpler if you allow the fallback to trigger the value, rather 
than requiring them to be duplicated. In one example above, the 
duplication actually caused an error to creep in (25% vs 2.5%).

I agree we want to have the value=&quot;&quot; attribute as well, even with text 
inside; one of the examples in the spec is something like:

   &lt;meter value=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;High Activity&lt;/meter&gt;
   &lt;meter value=&quot;0.25&quot;&gt;Low Activity&lt;/meter&gt;

...where the actual values are arbitrary, and merely relative to each 
other.

CSS could probably be used for this as well, indeed.
