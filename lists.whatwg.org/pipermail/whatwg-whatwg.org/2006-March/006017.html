<PRE>Henri Sivonen on 2006-03-11:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be beneficial to additionally stipulate that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. The meta element-based character encoding information declaration 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is expected to work only if the Basic Latin range of characters maps 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to the same bytes as in the US-ASCII encoding.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this realistic? I'm not really familiar enough with character 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encodings to say if this is what happens in general.
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose it is realistic. See below.
</I>
Yes, for most encodings, the US-ASCII range is the same, and if you restrict 
it a bit further (the &quot;INVARIANT&quot; charset in RFC 1345), it covers most of 
the ambiguous encodings. The others can be easily detected as they usually 
have very different bit patterns (EBCDIC) or word lengths (UTF-16, UTF-32).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. If there is no external character encoding information nor a BOM 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (see below), there MUST NOT be any non-ASCII bytes in the document 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> byte stream before the end of the meta element that declares the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> character encoding. (In practice this would ban unescaped non-ASCII 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> class names on the html and [head] elements and non-ASCII comments at 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the beginning of the document.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, can we realistically require this? I need to do some studies of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-latin pages, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> As UA behavior, no. As a conformance requirement, maybe.
</I>
If you require browsers to switch on-the-fly, they can redo the decoding 
when they find the &lt;meta&gt; anyway, and this is no longer a problem. There are 
a lot of documents with non-ASCII-language comments and &lt;title&gt; tags that 
are positioned before the &lt;meta&gt;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Authors should avoid including inline character encoding 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> information. Character encoding information should instead be 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> included at the transport level (e.g. using the HTTP Content-Type 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> header).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I disagree.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With HTML with contemporary UAs, there is no real harm in including 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the character encoding information both on the HTTP level and in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> meta as long as the information is not contradictory. On the contrary, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the author-provided internal information is actually useful when end 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> users save pages to disk using UAs that do not reserialize with 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> internal character encoding information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...and it breaks everything when you have a transcoding proxy, or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, not until you save to disk, since HTTP takes precedence. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> authors can escape this by using UTF-8. (Assuming here that tampering with 
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-8 would be harmful, wrong and pointless.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interestingly, transcoding proxies tend to be brought up by residents of 
</I>&gt;<i> Western Europe, North America or the Commonwealth. I have never seen a 
</I>&gt;<i> Russion person living in Russia or a Japanese person living in Japan talk 
</I>&gt;<i> about transcoding proxies in any online or offline discussion. That's why 
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt the importance of transcoding proxies.
</I>
Transcoding is very popular, especially in Russia. With mod_charset in 
Apache it will (AFAICT) use the information in the &lt;meta&gt; of the document to 
determine the source encoding and then transcode it to an encoding it 
believes the client can handle (based on browser sniffing). It transcodes on 
a byte level, so the &lt;meta&gt; reamains unchanged, but is overridden by the 
HTTP header.

The &lt;meta&gt; tag is really information to the server, it is the server that is 
*supposed* to read it and post the data into the HTTP header. Unfortunately 
not many servers support that, leaving us with having to parse them in the 
browsers instead. Reading the &lt;meta&gt; tag for encoding information is 
basically at the same level as guessing the encoding by frequency 
analysis--The server didn't say anything so perhaps you can get lucky.

&gt;&gt;<i> Character encoding information shouldn't be duplicated, IMHO, that's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just asking for trouble.
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest a mismatch be considered an easy parse error and, therefore, 
</I>&gt;<i> reportable.
</I>
That will not work in the mod_charset case above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For HTML, user agents must use the following algorithm in determining the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> character encoding of a document:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. If the transport layer specifies an encoding, use that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Shouldn't there be a BOM-sniffing step here? (UTF-16 and UTF-8 only; 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> UTF-32 makes no practical sense for interchange on the Web.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know, should there?
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there should.
</I>
BOM-sniffing should be done *after* looking at the transport layer's 
information. It might know something you don't. It's a part of the 
&quot;guessing-the-content&quot; step.

&gt;<i> Requirements I'd like to see:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Documents must specify a character encoding an must use an IANA-registered 
</I>&gt;<i> encoding and must identify it using its preferred MIME name or use a BOM 
</I>&gt;<i> (with UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32). UAs must recognize the preferred MIME name 
</I>&gt;<i> of every encoding they support that has a preferred MIME name. UAs should 
</I>&gt;<i> recognize IANA-registered aliases.
</I>
That could be useful, the only problem being that the IANA list of encoding 
labels is a bit difficult to read when you want to try figuring out which 
name to write.

&gt;<i> Documents must not use UTF-EBCDIC, BOCU-1, CESU-8, UTF-7, UTF-16BE (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> BOMless), UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE or any encodings from the EBCDIC 
</I>&gt;<i> family of encodings. Documents using the UTF-16 or UTF-32 encodings must 
</I>&gt;<i> have a BOM.
</I>
I don't think forbidding BOCU-1 is a good idea. If there is ever a proper 
specification written of it, it could be very useful as a compression format 
for documents.

&gt;<i> Encoding errors are easy parse errors. (Emit U+FFFD on bogus data.)
</I>
Yes, especially since encoding defintions tend to change over time.

&gt;<i> Authors are adviced to use the UTF-8 encoding. Authors are adviced not to 
</I>&gt;<i> use the UTF-32 encoding or legacy encodings. (Note: I think UTF-32 on the 
</I>&gt;<i> Web is harmful and utterly pointless, but Firefox and Opera support it.
</I>
UTF-32 can be useful as an internal format, but I agree that it's not very 
useful on the web. Not sure about the &quot;harmful&quot; bit, though.
