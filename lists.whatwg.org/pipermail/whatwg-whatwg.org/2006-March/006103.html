Actually, I wouldn't be so sure about that. It's the correct spelling
when you use it as a noun for a metric, but as a verb and as a measuring
instrument, I think it's &quot;meter&quot;.

My unabridged dictionary here seems to think so, too.

meter (3) n. 1. an instrument for measuring, esp. one that automatically
measures and records the quantity of a substance, as of gas, water, or
electricity, passing through or actuating it. -- v.t. 2. to measure by
means of a meter.

The other two definitions mention the British variant &quot;metre&quot;, but this
one does not.


FWIW, the hits on google for gauge and gage are similar if you search
for the words alone, but in conjunction with things like &quot;fuel&quot; or &quot;steel&quot;
or &quot;measure&quot;, gauge comes out about an order of magnitude more popular.
