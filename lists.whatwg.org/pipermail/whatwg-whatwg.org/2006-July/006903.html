<PRE>   You make the argument that people might be using |rev| intentionally
for some values and the the statistical method used by Goggle doesn't
make that determination. Let's look at the two most common uses.

   If you look at |rev=&quot;made&quot;|, the most common use of |rev|, it's
pretty clear that the use is intentional. However, |rev=&quot;made&quot;| is
pretty much equivalent to |rel=&quot;author&quot;|, which is nearly as common, so
the impact of eliminating |rev=&quot;made&quot;| is minimal. If you look at the
following link, note that |rev=&quot;made&quot;| is the only use of |rev|
mentioned, by the way:

<A HREF="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/head/link.html">http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/head/link.html</A>

   The second most common usage is |rev=&quot;stylesheet&quot;|. Since CSS style
sheets don't use HTML, let alone &lt;a&gt; and &lt;link&gt;, we can safely assume
that this is, in fact, either the result of confusion by the author or a
spelling type, and as you pointed out, a typo is unlikely. This really
does suggest a genuine problem with people not understanding the
difference between |rel| and |rev|, since |rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;| is the most
common use of |rel|. I really wish we could see more data on that, though.

   One of the problems with |rev| is that it's supposed to share values
with |rel|, but in reality many of these values are either have narrow
use cases for |rev| or are completely unusable, such as &quot;stylesheet&quot; and
&quot;icon&quot;. In my estimation, this will eventually result in a proliferation
of values that favor a specific value. In fact, that's what we've seen,
since most values are |rel|-centric.

   None of the values you mention are defined in HTML 4.01, and
considering you are the one asking for |rev| to be included in &quot;HTML 5&quot;,
I don't think you can consider yourself a typical author.
