<PRE>Hello Matthew,

That clears things up a bit.

But, if the intent is to really get rid of confusion then....  There's
actually 2 things I noticed confuse people.

#1: That the label you pick for the &quot;rel&quot; (or &quot;rev&quot;) needs to be a noun.  (I
do understand why... at least I think I do... so that you can use the same
label in the &quot;class&quot; attribute.  But it makes things difficult for some
people.)

#2: That &quot;rel&quot; (and &quot;rev&quot;) represent a relation between the two.  Often
people seem to want to &quot;classify&quot; what's at the end of the &quot;href&quot;.  (Instead
of specifying a relation.)  Perhaps a new attribute is needed.  Perhaps
&quot;hrefclass&quot;.


See ya

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    The second most common usage is |rev=&quot;stylesheet&quot;|. Since CSS style
</I>&gt;<i> sheets don't use HTML, let alone &lt;a&gt; and &lt;link&gt;, we can safely assume
</I>&gt;<i> that this is, in fact, either the result of confusion by the author or a
</I>&gt;<i> spelling type, and as you pointed out, a typo is unlikely. This really
</I>&gt;<i> does suggest a genuine problem with people not understanding the
</I>&gt;<i> difference between |rel| and |rev|, since |rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;| is the most
</I>&gt;<i> common use of |rel|. I really wish we could see more data on that, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    One of the problems with |rev| is that it's supposed to share values
</I>&gt;<i> with |rel|, but in reality many of these values are either have narrow
</I>&gt;<i> use cases for |rev| or are completely unusable, such as &quot;stylesheet&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;icon&quot;. In my estimation, this will eventually result in a proliferation
</I>&gt;<i> of values that favor a specific value. In fact, that's what we've seen,
</I>&gt;<i> since most values are |rel|-centric.
