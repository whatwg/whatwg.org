<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> As for myself, I use the &quot;rev&quot; attribute in an internal project (sorry,

&gt;<i> &gt; On the contrary, I would argue that we should get rid of it as fast as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;semantically minded&quot; by making the language more complicated than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; absolutely necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have to disagree here. Removing the complexity in the HTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specification just moves it to the semantic application where the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;semantically minded&quot; users have to agree on what the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inverse relations are. In my opinion the HTML spec is the place where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this distinction can be kept with the least amount of &quot;interfering&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity. As your survey shows, there is not a lot of confusion about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;rev&quot;, just some people having problems with spelling the &quot;rel&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute. I think there would probably have been a lot of &quot;herf&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attributes out there if they were not discovered as easily as they are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is not just that people mis-use the rev attribute; the point is
</I>&gt;<i> that with the exception of a single value (&quot;made&quot;), people *typo the &quot;rev&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute more often than they intentionally use it*.
</I>

It's difficult for me to see how they could &quot;typo&quot; it.  The &quot;L&quot; key and the
&quot;V&quot; key on my keyboard at least aren't anywhere near each other.  (It would
suggest to me that if they wrote &quot;rev&quot; instead of &quot;rel&quot;, then they either
&quot;meant it&quot; or they &quot;don't understand the difference&quot;.)

What makes you so sure they are making spelling mistakes?  Or that they
didn't actually mean it and aren't using it properly?

For example, I tend to use rev-author, rev-comment, and rev-tag quite alot.
These aren't typos; these are intentional.  And I do understand what each
means and am using them properly.

Is the system that generated that report able to &quot;know&quot; that I use them
properly?  Or did it just assume that they must have been mistakes?


Another interesting statistic: people use rel=&quot;made&quot; once for every 2.2
&gt;<i> instances of rev=&quot;made&quot;.
</I>

(Sorry if this is in that report you referred us to, but I didn't notice
it....)

How do you know that those usages of rev-made or rel-made were mistakes?
How do you know that they weren't intentional and weren't accurate?

Was the system that generated the report able to figure out which ones were
&quot;good&quot; and which ones were &quot;bad&quot;?



That is *far* more frequent a mistake than other
&gt;<i> typos (the &lt;script langauge=&quot;&quot;&gt; typo, which is so common that it appeared
</I>&gt;<i> in the top-1000 attributes, is only made once for every 833 uses of the
</I>&gt;<i> correct one -- and that's another example, just like rel/rev, where making
</I>&gt;<i> the typo causes no ill effects in browsers, so it is equivalent IMHO).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This, to me, suggests that in fact what you call a simple typo is not just
</I>&gt;<i> a typo, to me it seems to really be author confusion.
</I>

Again, what makes you so certain that the author was confused, and didn't
really mean to assert rev-made or rel-made?

I guess my question is.... Did the analysis that generated that report just
assume that any &quot;rev&quot; for a label that is usually asserted in a &quot;rel&quot; is a
typo or confusion by the author?  And that any &quot;rel&quot; for a label that is
usually asserted in a &quot;rev&quot; is a typo or confusion by the author too?


[...]

&gt;<i> Just for reference, what was the usage of the &quot;hreflang&quot; and &quot;media&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute in anchor tags? At what usage level do you feel it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apropriate to compromise backward compability by removing an attribute?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Removing those attributes wouldn't affect backwards compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a hreflang=&quot;&quot;&gt; was used about as much as &lt;a location.href=&quot;&quot;&gt;, &lt;hr
</I>&gt;<i> aligh=&quot;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;td heigth=&quot;&quot;&gt; (around 800th in the chart of top-1000
</I>&gt;<i> attributes in the sample). &lt;a media=&quot;&quot;&gt; didn't register. &lt;link
</I>&gt;<i> hreflang=&quot;&quot;&gt; came in at around 950th, &lt;link media=&quot;&quot;&gt; came in at around
</I>&gt;<i> 142nd (stylesheets mean this attribute is oft-used).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hreflang=&quot;&quot; and media=&quot;&quot; don't seem to cause any author damage. They
</I>&gt;<i> provide a useful hook that can't be done any other way. Thus they seem
</I>&gt;<i> potentially valuable and don't have a high associated cost.
</I>

Thanks for adding &quot;media&quot; to the &lt;a&gt; element BTW.  (I'm finding it useful
already in distinguishing RSS and Atom feeds meant for different purposes.)


See ya
