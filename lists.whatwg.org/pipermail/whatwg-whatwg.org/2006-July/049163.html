On the contrary, I would argue that we should get rid of it as fast as 
possible, so that we don't scare away authors who are becoming 
&quot;semantically minded&quot; by making the language more complicated than 
absolutely necessary.


&gt;<i> As developers start building semantics into web technologies, their

</I>
For HTML5 the assumption is that we're removing everything unless we can 
put forward a convincing argument to keep it.

What are the use cases for &quot;rev&quot;? Do they outweigh the author cost?


&gt;<i> Without the &quot;rev&quot;, we could still do this with &quot;rel&quot; however, the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> same label could NOT be used.  And then any kind of system to analyse 
</I>&gt;<i> this would have to understand what this labels actually meant and know 
</I>&gt;<i> what the &quot;reverse relation&quot; name was.
</I>
It would seem to me like that's the case anyway, for any practical 
application. Other than the software you have mentioned, I have never even 
heard of any generic-purpose parsers for this kind of stuff -- and if such 
a parser was going to be useful, you'd think that in the 16 or so years 
since HTML was invented, someone would have made one and people would be 
using it.


&gt;<i> That is essentially my personal reason for wanting &quot;rev&quot;.  So that the 
</I>&gt;<i> exact same label can be used no matter what the direction of the 
</I>&gt;<i> relation.  (That way a generic parser and query engine can be written 
</I>&gt;<i> for this type of stuff, even if the system does NOT understand the 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning of the labels.)
</I>
While I understand what you're saying, it seems highly theoretical. Data 
on authoring practice shows that authors simply don't understand rev=&quot;&quot;: 
the top five &lt;link rev=&quot;&quot;&gt; were made, stylesheet, owns, author, and owner. 
rev=&quot;made&quot; is the only one of those where rev=&quot;&quot; wasn't a typo for rel=&quot;&quot;.

Usage of &lt;a rev=&quot;&quot;&gt; was so low that even the &quot;height&quot; attribute on the 
&quot;space&quot; element is used more often, according to the data I have. And the 
&lt;space&gt; element doesn't even exist! In contrast, the &lt;a rel=&quot;&quot;&gt; attribute 
was used more than 60 times more often than the &lt;space height=&quot;&quot;&gt;. (I use 
&lt;space height=&quot;&quot;&gt; as the example here because that's the least-used 
attribute that I actually recorded data for; &lt;a rev=&quot;&quot;&gt; is used so rarely 
that it didn't even appear on my top-1000 attributes list. I have data 
regarding &lt;a rev=&quot;&quot;&gt; values because I specifically recordeded rel/rev data 
in the study, to determine whether or not we should keep rev=&quot;&quot;.)

(This data is based on a crawl of approximately one billion documents.)


&gt;<i> I'm using it for trust metrics and reputation.  (But that's just me and 
</I>&gt;<i> the software I write :-)  )
</I>
Could you give us some pointers to this software?
