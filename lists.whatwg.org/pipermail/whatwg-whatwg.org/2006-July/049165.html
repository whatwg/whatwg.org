RDF/A is an utter disaster and not a valid use case for anything. For a 
more detailed comment on RDF/a, see:

   <A HREF="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-May/004144.html">http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-May/004144.html</A>


&gt;<i> As for myself, I use the &quot;rev&quot; attribute in an internal project (sorry, 
</I>&gt;<i> no link) at work. I have to agree with Charles/Iliya that the 
</I>&gt;<i> recognition of &quot;rev&quot; is probably going up in the future if the adaption 
</I>&gt;<i> of new microformats continues.
</I>
It certainly can't go down.


&gt;<i> &gt; On the contrary, I would argue that we should get rid of it as fast as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible, so that we don't scare away authors who are becoming 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;semantically minded&quot; by making the language more complicated than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; absolutely necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to disagree here. Removing the complexity in the HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> specification just moves it to the semantic application where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;semantically minded&quot; users have to agree on what the corresponding 
</I>&gt;<i> inverse relations are. In my opinion the HTML spec is the place where 
</I>&gt;<i> this distinction can be kept with the least amount of &quot;interfering&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> complexity. As your survey shows, there is not a lot of confusion about 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rev&quot;, just some people having problems with spelling the &quot;rel&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute. I think there would probably have been a lot of &quot;herf&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes out there if they were not discovered as easily as they are.
</I>
The point is not just that people mis-use the rev attribute; the point is 
that with the exception of a single value (&quot;made&quot;), people *typo the &quot;rev&quot; 
attribute more often than they intentionally use it*.

Another interesting statistic: people use rel=&quot;made&quot; once for every 2.2 
instances of rev=&quot;made&quot;. That is *far* more frequent a mistake than other 
typos (the &lt;script langauge=&quot;&quot;&gt; typo, which is so common that it appeared 
in the top-1000 attributes, is only made once for every 833 uses of the 
correct one -- and that's another example, just like rel/rev, where making 
the typo causes no ill effects in browsers, so it is equivalent IMHO).

This, to me, suggests that in fact what you call a simple typo is not just 
a typo, to me it seems to really be author confusion.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As developers start building semantics into web technologies, their 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; going find that they need the &quot;rev&quot; attribute.  (Not sure if that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be enough &quot;justification&quot; here to keep it.  But since we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; already have it, it would be nice to keep it.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For HTML5 the assumption is that we're removing everything unless we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can put forward a convincing argument to keep it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are the use cases for &quot;rev&quot;? Do they outweigh the author cost?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See RDF/A.
</I>
See above. RDF/a is not a use case.


&gt;<i> What is actually the author cost in keeping the &quot;rev&quot; attribute? 
</I>
See above. One mistake for every 2.2 correct uses.


&gt;<i> Wouldn't you say that there is a cost in removing it as well?
</I>
Not a significant one. The &quot;rev&quot; attribute is almost never used. Almost 
all uses are actually rev=&quot;made&quot;, which is a non-issue (it is trivially 
replaced by rel=&quot;author&quot; and we can grandfather that usage in if there is 
a tool that requires that information, for back-compat).


&gt;<i> And removing it also contradicts the statement &quot;care has been taken to 
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that backwards-compatibility is retained&quot; in the draft (1.3.)
</I>
Preventing future documents from using this attribute does not break 
backwards compatibility.


&gt;<i> Just for reference, what was the usage of the &quot;hreflang&quot; and &quot;media&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute in anchor tags? At what usage level do you feel it is 
</I>&gt;<i> apropriate to compromise backward compability by removing an attribute?
</I>
Removing those attributes wouldn't affect backwards compatibility.

&lt;a hreflang=&quot;&quot;&gt; was used about as much as &lt;a location.href=&quot;&quot;&gt;, &lt;hr 
aligh=&quot;&quot;&gt;, and &lt;td heigth=&quot;&quot;&gt; (around 800th in the chart of top-1000 
attributes in the sample). &lt;a media=&quot;&quot;&gt; didn't register. &lt;link 
hreflang=&quot;&quot;&gt; came in at around 950th, &lt;link media=&quot;&quot;&gt; came in at around 
142nd (stylesheets mean this attribute is oft-used).

hreflang=&quot;&quot; and media=&quot;&quot; don't seem to cause any author damage. They 
provide a useful hook that can't be done any other way. Thus they seem 
potentially valuable and don't have a high associated cost.
