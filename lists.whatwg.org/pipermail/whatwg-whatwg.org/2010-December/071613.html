Today that is not possible on any browser that I know of and it's one of if not the biggest selling point for our non-JavaScript editor (we offer both Java applet and Javascript based editors).  This use case would require providing spelling suggestions, not just identifying the location of spelling errors.

There are also styling considerations which are addressed quite well with the current oncontextmenu handler and using pure HTML but which would likely become quite difficult when trying to integrate with a browser's native menu.

They're on their way: the resulting context menu would allow you to add items to the UAs menu. At some point an API may develop to style and/or script the context menu.  This is a limitation until context menus are more flexible.

Allow me to reiterate:

</I>

It is possible today to replace the context menu with a custom one and this works incredibly well for a usability perspective. I don't see a need to change this.

It is also possible today for rich text editors to have the built-in browser spell checker mark any spelling errors. I don't see a need to change this.

What isn't possible is to have the combination of spell checking as you type suggestions with a custom context menu. Inline spell checking with right-click for suggestions has become almost the exclusive way that authors use spell checkers. I regularly and repeatedly encounter clients and prospective clients who are prepared to spend significant amounts of money to solve this problem (by purchasing a non-JavaScript based editor).

Adrian Sutton.
