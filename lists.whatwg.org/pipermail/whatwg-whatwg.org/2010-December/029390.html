For most people it'll be a duration. I don't think it's a big deal.

I don't see how why they would. The only time it makes a difference is if 
they have a non-zero starting time, and they'd have to handle that too 
(using .initialTime). It's unlikely that someone will use .initialTime 
correctly, but .duration incorrectly, IMHO.

Also if they do use it incorrectly the mistake will probably be pretty 
obvious. :-)

That's a good question; if .initialTime is always going to be zero then we 
will likely just drop it.

</I>
The UI would be the same either way -- instead of 0..10 it would just 
5..15 or some such. DVRs use this kind of UI a lot, for instance when 
they show the &quot;real&quot; time of the video on their seek bar.
