What's the use case?

In practice, as far as I can tell, you'd either want the browser to handle 
all the spelling and grammar checking itself, or you'd want to do it all 
yourself. This would argue for an on/off switch for UA-provided checking, 
which indeed is available (the spellcheck=&quot;&quot; attribute), and for ARIA 
exposure of the &quot;spelling mistake&quot; semantic, which is also available.

</I>
Doesn't letting the UA take care of this adequately address this use case? 
If not, why not?


This may be an opportune time to remind everyone that there is a 
process for adding new features, and it begins with establishing use 
cases, researching existing solutions, and testing possible ideas:

Insofar as extending context menus is concerned, that's not a 
spelling/grammar checking issue, it's a context menu issue -- and one that 
is resolved by the contextmenu=&quot;&quot;/&lt;menu&gt; feature in the spec.


&gt;<i> Notably, users do not want the full browser context menu with some 
</I>&gt;<i> custom additions (though obviously this would make a good option for 
</I>&gt;<i> some users) - having &quot;View Source&quot; for example is quite damaging to the 
</I>&gt;<i> usability of rich text editors since it would display a read-only source 
</I>&gt;<i> without running the editors source filtering, as opposed to the editor's 
</I>&gt;<i> built in source view which filters correctly and is editable.  There are 
</I>&gt;<i> also styling considerations which are addressed quite well with the 
</I>&gt;<i> current oncontextmenu handler and using pure HTML but which would likely 
</I>&gt;<i> become quite difficult when trying to integrate with a browser's native 
</I>&gt;<i> menu.
</I>
I am skeptical about allowing Web pages decide what should be in the 
context menu. Adding things is ok, but removing things leads to a broken 
user experience. For example, as a user I frequently make use of &quot;view 
source&quot;, and I don't think it would be good for a page to be able to 
remove that feature.

</I>
_Any_ use cases would be a start. :-)

What's the problem you're trying to solve?

&lt;mark&gt; is the element for this purpose.
