<PRE>Thanks for the feedback guys, really appreciate it.

Using &lt;article&gt; elements within other &lt;article&gt; elements feels a bit like
we'd just be replacing &lt;div&gt; for &lt;article&gt;, it seems to remove some of the
logical distinction between different types of content.

As the use-case would potentially be huge (previously stated impact to
Blogs/Message Boards/News outlets), is there any more mileage in perhaps
using a &lt;feedback&gt; (or similar) element, as suggested by Bruce Hyslop?

A &lt;feedback&gt;,or similar, (&lt;response&gt;?) element would distinguish content as
a response to an article, and therefore denote that it serves a different
purpose to the main content in the &lt;article&gt; element.

Thoughts?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi gang,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if anyone can help me...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I attended &#160;great talk today by Bruce Lawson from Opera about HTML5. I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wondering, is there any plan to implement a &lt;comment&gt; element within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML5 spec? I&#185;m suggesting this as a complimentary element to the &lt;article&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> element.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe it could be useful as it could be used to differentiate between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audience generated content and article-author generated content. This could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enable search engines to differentiate between the 2 types of content, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weigh them differently in different searches. Semantically and structurally,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like this seems to make sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would mean huge implications for all the blogs out there, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasing number of commenting systems on News outlets.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cool, let me know if this has already been covered, or if it&#185;s not a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea, why? :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is potentially interesting.  Right now, the correct way to
</I>&gt;<i> mark up comments is to just put each in an &lt;article&gt; of their own (as
</I>&gt;<i> each is a piece of independent content).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What benefits could be brought along by instead using &lt;comment&gt;?  I
</I>&gt;<i> can think of a few potential benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Differentiating between the main article and user-generated content
</I>&gt;<i> in response (you bring this up).  Would this be useful for search
</I>&gt;<i> engines?  I'm not sure.  Would it be useful to weight comment content
</I>&gt;<i> differently from article content?  Perhaps weight links in comments
</I>&gt;<i> less than links in the rest of the page?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Providing a bit more information to screen-readers that may
</I>&gt;<i> navigate by headings or sections, to make it easier to skip to or over
</I>&gt;<i> the comments on a post.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Make the authoring pattern a bit more obvious - rather than having
</I>&gt;<i> to learn that it's okay and recommended to nest &lt;article&gt;s like that,
</I>&gt;<i> authors could just naturally gravitate towards using &lt;article&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;comment&gt; together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing to note - &lt;comment&gt; has already been used by IE6 and earlier
</I>&gt;<i> as an alternative to the &lt;!-- --&gt; syntax for HTML comments.  They
</I>&gt;<i> apparently stopped supporting this in IE7, though (I can confirm that
</I>&gt;<i> it no longer does anything special in IE8), so we probably don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to worry about it.  No other browser does anything special for it, it
</I>&gt;<i> seems, so the compat impact is apparently small enough to be ignored.
