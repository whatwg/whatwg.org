Form controls are part of constraint validation for completeness only, as 
far as I can tell. Anything that's visible and submitted is a candidate 
for constraint validation.


&gt;<i> This would prevent having invalid elements styled exactly like the 
</I>&gt;<i> submit controls (which would let the user think the submit control is 
</I>&gt;<i> invalid) and it would prevent having :valid applying on buttons for no 
</I>&gt;<i> apparent reason.
</I>
I don't imagine people would style :valid without specifying the specific 
element. I mean, you wouldn't want the same style to apply to your radio 
buttons and your text fields and you &lt;select&gt; elements either.


&gt;<i> This pseudo-class would apply on all submit control inside a form which
</I>&gt;<i> has at least one invalid element subject for constraint validation.
</I>
If people want to style submit controls based on the states of other 
elements in the form, then we could certainly create a new pseudo for 
that. Do people do that enough to justify it?


&gt;<i> Current Gecko nightlies (and next beta, beta7) have a 
</I>&gt;<i> :-moz-submit-invalid pseudo-class. Submit controls can still be marked 
</I>&gt;<i> invalid but that might change before the final release if there is an 
</I>&gt;<i> agreement that :-moz-submit-invalid is a better way to fulfill the need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note for web authors on this list, :-moz-submit-invalid 
</I>&gt;<i> currently has a default style on Firefox but that is very likely going 
</I>&gt;<i> to change for beta8.
</I>
Do people use this feature much?
