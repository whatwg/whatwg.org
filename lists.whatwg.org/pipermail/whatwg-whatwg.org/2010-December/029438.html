</I>
The idea behind timeupdate is just to update the seek bar, and to do so at 
whatever rate the browser thinks is the best balance between power/CPU 
usage and user experience.

There's currently no way to do anything on a per-frame basis explicitly, 
but if we were to support that use case, I imagine we'd want to do 
something more efficient and precise than just firing an event and hoping 
the script can paint the video before the next frame.

That's probably a feature for later, though. Implementations haven't quite 
gotten the current set of features down reliably yet. :-)

Yeah, if we support this it would make sense to do it in some clever way 
where you couldn't (easily) abuse it, e.g. have the registered callback be 
GPU code that doesn't run in the same scripting context (not a concrete 
proposal, just an idea -- we'd have to wait until WebGL has a proven 
solution for safely running code on the GPU).

Indeed.
