Long story short: I haven't changed the spec where it talks about &lt;video&gt;, 
&lt;source type&gt;, Content-Type, and direct file inspection for type 
determination. My plan is to just wait and see what browsers do and update 
the spec accordingly in due course. This is mostly because we clearly have 
a wide range of opinions regarding what the right behaviour is, 
implementations are still changing, and implementors often disagree with 
their own implementations at this stage.

I think that they would argue that these should work either way, with the

I could go either way, but I think the road to all-sniff is less steep.

I'm not sure I follow. It works fine for sniffing JPEGs sent with the

Because a number of people I respect, such as Boris, who also happen to

Certainly it won't change if we have any sniffing going on. :-)

The spec doesn't reflect my position. It would be quite different if it 
did. :-) It reflects what can be implemented interoperably within the 
constraints put forward by implementors.

</I>
text/html wouldn't be sniffed as video, any more than it would be sniffed 
as an image if served at the top level. I agree that this can lead to 
differences between &lt;video&gt; and top-level, even with sniffing in both places.


&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see how sniffing vs. using MIME type makes a compatibility

</I>&gt;<i> The big danger with sniffing, as always, is that the server will think

</I>
Indeed, which is why we must specify any sniffing we do.

This is indeed a problem (but it's three browsers, not two). Eventually 
the spec will change to whatever is implemented. For now I'm waiting to 
see if compliance with the specs can still be achieved. (Note that the 
spec as it stands takes a compromise position: the content is only 
accepted if the Content-Type and type=&quot;&quot; values are supported types (if 
present) and the content sniffs as a supported type, but nothing in the 
spec checks that all three values are the same.)

i.e. approach implementors, get experimental code out there, see how much

Indeed. That's partly the thinking behind the requirment in the spec today 
that the type be recognised as well as the binary data; it would mean we 
can do the same for videos as for images (where the types are all treated 
as synonyms for each other and enable sniffing).

The didaster is uninteroperable sniffing. That's not what is being

I can't speak as to whether the W3C think it's the W3C's problem, but it 
_is_ the WHATWG's problem, in that the goal here is interoperability and 
the often incorrect use of Content-Type is leading to interoperability

Currently it's for no type, application/octet-stream with no parameters,

I think the most logical thing for top-level browsing contexts would be to 
do the same as for images: sniff when you've detected binary, or when 
you've been given a known video type.

That's more or less what the spec has. If the type in the HTML (or the 
Content-Type, indeed) is one you don't support (modulo 
application/octet-stream for practical reasons), then you don't play it, 
even if it's a supported file. If the types in the HTML and HTTP are types 
that _are_ supported, then the spec say you sniff to find out what exactly 
it is and then render it if that's still supported.

X-Content-Type-Options doesn't stop all sniffing in the browsers that

I don't think the latter need lead to the former any more than in the case

That's possible, but so what? They already sniff. We can't convince them 
not to sniff any more than we can convince them to sniff in a particular 
way. That game is already lost. Where we might be able to have convergence 
is with Web browsers; that seems like the best place to start. Once we 
have interop there, there becomes a much higher incentive to the other 
players to converge on the same rules.

Your argument works equally well in the other direction:

The CSS-inclusion attacks are due to undocumented sniffing (or rather,

and the file type), not specced behaviour.


&gt;<i> Lack of sniffing behaviour, however, has never caused a vulnerability.

That's clearly untrue -- all it takes is for a server to incorrectly label 
untrusted user-provided content as text/html for there to be a vulnerability.

True, if it's labeled as text/html currently you'll only sniff for HTML or 
Atom/RSS feeds, not images.

No, it can be detected as an image. Not sure why that would be a security 
problem. The security problem would be if a file got treated as text/html 
when it wasn't label as such (privilege escalation). In the case of a 
binary file labeled as text/plain and then being treated as an image, the 
only serious security problem I can think of would be if the image 
used a code execution vulnerability, but then the problem would presumably 
exist even if the image was labeled &quot;correctly&quot; as an image, and would 
likely work regardless of the origin, so it would be hardly helpful to not 
load it if the file was labeled as text/plain.

Right, the problem is if people use _different_ sniffing. Hence the intent 
to standardise any sniffing we decide should be implemented.

I disagree with the premise here. There's nothing about sniffing that 
makes in less susceptible to interoperability convergence with a 
specification than any other aspect of a browser.

Exactly.

At this point I'm in a similar situation, waiting to see what the browsers

&gt;<i> &gt; canPlayType() is now hardcoded as not supporting

Maybe.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; parameter simply should be ignored, thus the advice [...]:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;The MIME type &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; with no parameters is

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Note: In the absence of a specification to the contrary, the MIME

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;application/octet-stream;codecs=theora&quot;, is a type that the user 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; agent knows it cannot render.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is incorrect, because it requires handling 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;application/octet-stream;codecs=theora&quot; differently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's not incorrect. The type with no parameters is a special case 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that corresponds to a common configuration default. The case with

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration and thus clearly not a video format the UA supports.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that it's incorrect to make this distinction, and that it's

</I>
&quot;codecs&quot; is mentioned here because people asked how it should be handled, 
so clearly it's relevant.

The point is that it's not &quot;application/octet-stream;codecs=theora&quot; that 
is handled &quot;differently&quot;. It's handled the same as &quot;bogus/bogus&quot;, as 
&quot;application/octet-stream;bogus=bogus&quot;, etc. It's very specifically the 
exact magic string &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; that is handled specially, 
and that only for historical reasons.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's also not clear whether the note applies to all parameters or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; just &quot;codecs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The normative text you quote doesn't mention any specific parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In which case it would be a *bit* clearer if the note used a parameter 
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't suggest that &quot;codecs&quot; has any meaning on a/o.
</I>
The note in question explictly says &quot;that parameter is not defined for 
that type&quot;, so I don't think it's realistic to say that someone could be 
confused into thinking that the parameter is defined for that type.


&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding codecs=&quot;&quot; in particular, it's an implementation reality that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user agents that support it are likely to support it regardless of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type, so there's really no point trying to maintain an artificial

I do not. This doesn't affect the note in question though.
