</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm investigating how TimedTracks can be used for in-band-data-tracks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; within MPEG transport streams (used for cable television).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In this format, the number and types of in-band-data-tracks can change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; over time. &#160;So, for example, when the programming switches from a
</I>&gt;<i> football
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; game to a movie, an alternate language track may appear that wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; before. &#160;Later, when the programming changes again, that language track
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's not clear to me how these changes are exposed by the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> Media
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Element events.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The thinking is that you switch between different streams by setting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; src=&quot;&quot; attribute to point to another stream, in which case you'll get an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emptied event along with another bunch of events. If you have a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source where audio/video/text streams appear and disappear, there's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really any way to handle it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe &quot;in-band&quot; was the keyword in the request.
</I> 
That is correct.  I'm working on synchronizing JavaScript applications with video content using in-band EISS signals.

&gt;<i> I do not know how technically the change of stream composition works
</I>&gt;<i> in MPEG, but in Ogg we have to end a current stream and start a new
</I>&gt;<i> one to switch compositions. This has been called &quot;sequential
</I>&gt;<i> multiplexing&quot; or &quot;chaining&quot;. In this case, stream setup information is
</I>&gt;<i> repeated, which would probably lead to creating a new steam handler
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly a new firing of &quot;loadedmetadata&quot;. I am not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> chaining is implemented in browsers.
</I>
The short answer for changing stream composition is that there is a Program Map Table (PMT) that is repeated every 100 milliseconds and describes the content of the stream.  Depending on the programming, the stream's composition could change entering/exiting every advertisement. 

&gt;<i> In a live situation you basically don't have a choice and you have to
</I>&gt;<i> use chaining when your input streams change. For a canned situation
</I>&gt;<i> you can set up all the required tracks from the start and just have
</I>&gt;<i> them send data later or stop sending earlier. In the canned document
</I>&gt;<i> situation therefore the number of tracks does not change. It's just
</I>&gt;<i> that data may not be available for all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The &quot;loadedmetadata&quot; event is used to indicate that the TimedTracks are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ready, but it appears that it is only fired before playback begins. &#160;Is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; this event fired again whenever a new track is discovered? &#160;Is there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; another event that is intended for this situation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an &quot;onload&quot; event on the TimedTrack to indicate that a track
</I>&gt;<i> is finished loading. But there is no event to indicate that a new
</I>&gt;<i> track is available.
</I>
Does the &quot;onload&quot; event fire on in-band tracks?  My current implementation only uses the &quot;oncuechange&quot; event, as you can't be sure the in-band track is ever completely loaded.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Similarly, is there an event that indicates when a track has been 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; removed?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#160;Or is this also handled by the &quot;loadedmetadata&quot; event somehow?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, there is no &quot;onunload&quot; event on the TimedTracks.
</I>
It's possible that you wouldn't need to unload a TimedTrack, if empty tracks were &quot;recycled&quot; for new tracks as needed.  I'm looking at this approach now.

&gt;<i> &gt; No, the loadedmetadata event is only fired once per resource, it's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the event you're looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for actual solutions, I think that having loadedmetadata fire again
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the number or type of streams change would make some sense.
</I>
This is the way I'm currently doing this, but we're evaluating if this will cause other problems.
