</I>
The &quot;pause&quot; thing is never invoked when waiting for network behaviour on 
the same event loop. (That wouldn't work, as you point out.)

Ok, done.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think that's true; for example you could be in an unstable

</I>
No, the parser is defined in terms of tasks and its interaction with the 
event loop (including what is a stable state) is defined.


&gt;<i> Thus, &lt;video&gt; would be unnecessarily delayed in a way that &lt;img&gt; isn't.
</I>
Actually &lt;img&gt; waits for much the same thing. :-) (Its rendering is 
updated when the event loop spins, which is around the same time as what 
is called a &quot;stable state&quot;.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Therefore, when reaching that step, if the resource selection 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; algorithm was triggered by a script, wait until that script has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; finished and then continue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Per spec as currently written, this will give the wrong behavior.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, if the script in question calls showModalDialog, this is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supposed to interrupt the script task and spin the event loop, and so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your synchronous section would need to run while the modal dialog is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up.  It doesn't sound like your implementation does that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That could be, but is this behavior actually useful for anything? It's 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly simpler to implement and more predictable for authors to 
</I>&gt;<i> always wait until the current script has finished executing.
</I>
Consider trying to play a sound in the background while the dialog is up, 
for instance.

It was meant to be the former. I've fixed it.


&gt;<i> In other words, will the synchronous section always be executed?
</I>
Not in between one &lt;script&gt; and a &lt;script&gt; that was document.write()ten by 
that script, no, not always.


&gt;<i> I think I meant to say that it if the synchronous section has run 
</I>&gt;<i> depends on &quot;whether or not the parser happened to return to the event 
</I>&gt;<i> loop before the script&quot;. In other words, networkState could be 
</I>&gt;<i> NETWORK_NO_SOURCE, NETWORK_EMPTY or NETWORK_LOADING here. Hopefully all 
</I>&gt;<i> my conclusions are incorrect and there's actually a guarantee that the 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous sections runs before any scripts execute, see above.
</I>
There is not such a guarantee.

Er, yes! Oops.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I now wonder about the intention of play() (and also of pause()). As 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I understood it, they are both meant to reload the media resource if 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; @currentSrc has changed, similar to what load() is supposed to do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not believe that has ever been the intent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both descriptions of play() and pause() have a &quot;loading the media 
</I>&gt;<i> resource&quot; in them.
</I>
Yes, but not for the purpose of reloading, only for the purpose of loading 
the resource in the first place.


&gt;<i> I assumed that if the @currentSrc had changed, that would trigger 
</I>&gt;<i> loading the new media resource, too. If that is not the intention, maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> the non-normative description should point out that it only triggers 
</I>&gt;<i> loading the media resource when the @src attribute is being set for the 
</I>&gt;<i> very first time.
</I>
Well that's not quite accurate either... it does it if the networkState is 
NETWORK_EMPTY, which can happen in a variety of conditions. I'm open to 
changing this text (from &quot;if necessary&quot; which is what it says now) but I 
really don't know what to change it to that would be both accurate and 
helpful.


&gt;<i> Though, to be honest, I don't really see a difference between setting 
</I>&gt;<i> @src through JavaScript for the first time (which IIUC also has a 
</I>&gt;<i> NETWORK_EMPTY state) and re-setting it again a subsequent time - IMHO 
</I>&gt;<i> both should consistently either include the media resource loading or 
</I>&gt;<i> exclude it.
</I>
The difference is that the first time there's nothing loaded, so to play() 
anything you have to load it, whereas the second time there's already 
something loaded, which play() can just play straight away without having 
to load anything first.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sure, but this is only a snippet of an actual application. If, e.g.,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you really must do it all using script, just use canPlayType and

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for adding that advice. I think it's important to point that out.

I can add it to the spec too if you think that would help. Where would a 
good place for it be?
