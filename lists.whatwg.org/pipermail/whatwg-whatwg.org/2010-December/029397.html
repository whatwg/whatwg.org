This is an implementation choice; the spec allows either the poster to be 
used or the first frame. This is to allow the browser to use the poster 
frame until playback begins, but to then use the first frame if the user 
seeks back to the start of the video.


&gt;<i> The poster should not show while the player is seeking (some browser 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation do show the poster while seeking, resulting a flashes)
</I>
That's an implementation bug. The spec doesn't allow that.


&gt;<i> The poster should show again after the video has ended.
</I>
Why?


&gt;<i> The visibility of the poster should be scriptable and/or controllable 
</I>&gt;<i> using an attribute. Meaning that one should be able to turn on/off the 
</I>&gt;<i> poster (without changing the poster attrbute's value)
</I>
What's the use case for this?

That would be annoying in a different way -- it would mean you couldn't 
seek back to the start of the video and see the first frame.


We could make the spec more precise and require that a particular 
behaviour occur before playback has ever happened and another after 
playback has ever happened, but in practice I think that there is only one 
behaviour that is useful and desireable enough that all browsers will 
implement it, and we don't gain much by making the other more esotecir 
behaviours non-conforming for those few people who would prefer it the 
other way. (In general it is considered bad form to require particular UI 
unless there is a strong reason to do so.)

The default behaviour without script should be the most useful behaviour, 
not the behaviour that can most easily be turned into another behaviour 
with script.

This seems consistent with the spec's requirements.


&gt;<i>  * Don't show the poster when the video buffers - just pause the video

This also.


&gt;<i>  * We've never had anyone request different poster images for begin /

</I>
I'm not aware of people wanting to have it appear at the end -- this never 
came up in the study of use cases. Can you elaborate on this? Are there 
examples of sites that do this today? It seems like you could just put the 
&quot;end poster frame&quot; in the last frame of view instead.

Not sure what this is referencing.

What is reset()?

The goal isn't to make HTML declarative to the extent possible, but to 
make it declarative for the most common 80% of use cases.


&gt;<i> As regards having control over the poster's visibility using

</I>
It seems clear that they can play it again if they want to... why would 
they not be able to? Do you have an example of a site I can use that does 
this? I'm curious to study this kind of UI.


&gt;<i> Seeing that there is no way to show it again (after it has disappeared)

I don't really see why one would want to turn on the poster. What's the 
use case?


&gt;<i> Yes, I know one can assign/un-assign the poster attribute. But really is

</I>
If you want to change the poster, changing the poster=&quot;&quot; attribute seems 
like a perfectly reasonable way to do it.

I agree that this is a description of good UI, but not that we should 
mandate it to the point of making other implementation non-conforming.


&gt;<i> I'd also like to add that...

</I>&gt;<i> available.
</I>
Agreed, to the extent that there doesn't seem to be a good use case for a 
&quot;pause poster&quot; in the first place.


&gt;<i> And I'd also like to add that...
</I>&gt;<i> If there is a &quot;end poster&quot; then it must be displayed when the user stop the

</I>&gt;<i> be shown.
</I>
If we supported this feature that's how it should work, sure.


&gt;<i> Finally I'd like to add that...
</I>&gt;<i> There may be one or more posters, the start/pause/end posters may be the exact
</I>&gt;<i> same poster or different posters.
</I>&gt;<i> The 3 different types of posters must be scriptable to allow rotation between
</I>&gt;<i> multiple different posters.
</I>
I really don't see much evidence that this is a use case that needs 
supporting.


&gt;<i> Does posters support hotzones at all? To allow clickable 
</I>&gt;<i> items/links/symbols (urls?). Just curious!

Not currently.

What's the use case? Is this really something that happens enough to

</I>&gt;<i> Could a call to video.load() reset this state?

It could, yes, according to the spec today, but it also causes the whole 
video to reload from the network (modulo caching).

</I>
Currently the spec does allow the poster to be shown after load(), since 
the poster can get shown at any time where the current position is zero, 
and load() resets that.


&gt;<i> Ideally poster should be an object (a property of the video element)

It's not clear to me that the use cases we've seen justify such complexity.

I think this would make sense if we see evidence that authors actually 
want this behaviour (e.g. they go out of their way to implement it). Do we 
see such evidence in Flash players, for instance?

</I>
That seems reasonable. You can also just use another &lt;video&gt; element and 
fade it in over the top and then remove the old one.


&gt;<i> In my mind, &#8220;load()&#8221; does not imply that the poster should also 
</I>&gt;<i> show. The video stream and poster are quite frankly independent of each 
</I>&gt;<i> other. One is a video stream and the other is an image.
</I>
They're not independent. They're part of the same element.

load() just tells the &lt;video&gt; element to restart. load() is implicitly 
called when you create the &lt;video&gt; element, it's what makes the video 
load in the first place. It makes sense that it would reset the playback 
position, poster, etc.


&gt;<i> The other aspect is that the url to the video changes frequently (in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to prevent bandwidth stealing and such). Using load could impact 
</I>&gt;<i> this delicate balance as well.
</I>
Using a changing URL to avoid someone referencing your video doesn't seem 
like an especially good design. I don't think we should optimise the spec 
to support such a design.


&gt;<i> I fail to see why we can&#8217;t simply have a way to turn on the poster 
</I>&gt;<i> without impacting anything else, especially as it pertains to the video 
</I>&gt;<i> stream. The poster and the video are separate and should remain so.
</I>
I'm not sure I agree with this premise.

The latter sounds like a bug. load() should set /paused/ to true per spec.

That's not how standardisation works. We don't add all the features for 
which we can't find compelling arguments _against_, we only add features 
for which we can find compelling arguments _for_. Compelling arguments 
usually come in the form of use cases (e.g. large numbers of sites that 
are working around the lack of a feature), or compatibility (e.g. lots 
of browsers doing something).
