</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Page1.html:

</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Page2.html:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p id=&quot;test&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     window.setInterval(function() { document.getElementById(&quot;test&quot;).innerHTML
</I>&gt;<i> += &quot;.&quot;; }, 500);
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Assume the user waits until the interval has fired several times, then 
</I>&gt;<i> presses the button, waits a while, and presses it again.  There are 
</I>&gt;<i> three possible outcomes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When the iframe is reattached, the inner page reloads.  This seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> go beyond the wording of the spec, which says only &quot;When an iframe 
</I>&gt;<i> element is first inserted into a document, the user agent must create a 
</I>&gt;<i> nested browsing context, and then process the iframe attributes for the 
</I>&gt;<i> first time.&quot;  (This isn't the first time the iframe is inserted into the 
</I>&gt;<i> document, so we shouldn't process the iframe attributes again.)
</I>
Agreed that this contradicts the spec currently.


&gt;<i> 2. The interval (and presumably, all events) in the iframe is paused 
</I>&gt;<i> while it's been detached (since the document is no longer fully active, 
</I>&gt;<i> but it also has not been discarded because of the global reference to 
</I>&gt;<i> its container element).
</I>
The timeout is paused. Events in general aren't necessarily paused; for 
example you can synchronously dispatch an event using dispatchEvent() on a 
document in an inactive browsing context. Tasks are paused though (so most 
events don't fire).

Actually, the spec wasn't really clear about the status of the browsing 
context of an iframe that was taken out of a document. I've made the spec 
clearer on this matter.


&gt;<i> 3. The interval (and presumably, all events) continues to fire while 
</I>&gt;<i> it's been detached, and the content of page2 will have changed while 
</I>&gt;<i> it's been detached from page1.
</I>
That doesn't match the spec.


&gt;<i> So far, Chrome 6, Opera 10.6 and Firefox 3.6 follow #1, and IE 8 follows 
</I>&gt;<i> #3. My reading of the &quot;fully active&quot; clause of the spec leads me to 
</I>&gt;<i> expect #2. Which of these behaviors is the desired one?  And/or, would 
</I>&gt;<i> it be desirable to permit authors to specify which behavior they intend?
</I>
The spec is #2; it is an attempt to get as close to most existing browsers 
as is probably necessary for compatibility, while still allowing the 
iframe to be useful (e.g. for the regrafted-iframe trick used by GMail).

</I>&gt;<i> live document could re-start async operations correctly.
</I>
All that currently happens with respect to pausing is that tasks for the 
document don't get processed (they remain in the queue). It's actually the 
same mechanism that's used for back-forward interactions; per spec, 
currently, if you grab a reference (from another Window) to a document 
that you then send into session history (bfcache), you can still mutate 
that document, call dispatchEvent() on it, run scripts in it, etc. Since 
you have a reference to it, it won't get automatically evicted, and when 
you traverse the history back to it the changes will be visible (and 
queued events and other tasks, e.g. parsing, will start firing again).

The one difference between session history and moving an iframe out of a 
document is that with the session history when you send a document into 
the &quot;back&quot; history, it gets unload/pagehide events (and pageshow when it 
comes back), whereas the iframe doesn't get any notification at all.

Not per spec.

Right. This is intended to avoid exposing the specifics of GC.

Pages don't _have_ to handle it; there's a number of cases, e.g. if they 
have any 'unload' event handlers, that result in a document being 
classified a lost cause. Search for &quot;salvageable&quot; in the spec.


&gt;<i> Why not reuse those mechanisms?  A strawman claim: Nothing may be

</I>&gt;<i> I missing that breaks this analogy? (It wouldn't surprise me if I missed 
</I>&gt;<i> something obvious, either... :)
</I>
It's very rare, and done only by the author intentionally, so I'm not sure 
there's any reason to really provide a lot of infrastructure to support 
it. Just having the behaviour be whatever falls out of the way more 
important things are specced seems simpler and sufficient.


&gt;<i> Another reason to consider suspending detached iframes: suppose that in 
</I>&gt;<i> the chat window example below, the iframe wasn't just a same-origin 
</I>&gt;<i> place to store global state, but also had its own UI, with callbacks and 
</I>&gt;<i> event handlers and whatnot.  If, during the interim while the iframe was 
</I>&gt;<i> being detached, adopted and reattached, that frame executed a timer that 
</I>&gt;<i> popped up a modal alert or prompt to the user, how would the user 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably know where that alert came from?  And what document(s?) 
</I>&gt;<i> should be paused while the alert is shown?
</I>
Per spec, it can't get a timer or any callback or asynchronous event or 
network task while it is detached, so nothing could trigger the alert.


&gt;<i> Regarding XHR and such -- I guess what I'm suggesting is suspending the 
</I>&gt;<i> event loop, but not necessarily suspending asynch processes.  So XHR can 
</I>&gt;<i> continue to queue tasks; media can continue to buffer; resources can 
</I>&gt;<i> continue to load.
</I>
That's what the spec currently requires (though the browser is of course 
entirely entitled to throttle any network traffic, etc).

</I>
Ah, interesting. Ok. That doesn't really affect the iframe case, since in 
the iframe case the document doesn't stop being the active doc of its 
browsing context, it just stops being fully active (since it stops 
having a parent browsing context).

It's not clear to me what permissions would be based on the top-level 
browsing context rather than on the Window itself.


&gt;<i> Note that in Gecko documents with active network requests never go into

</I>
Currently the spec doesn't use &quot;has pending network activity&quot; as a flag to 
make a document non-salvageable, but allows documents to which nobody has 
a reference (excluding the reference from the session history) to be 
discarded arbitrarily, which is intended to handle this case (it's 
presumed that if you have a reference to a document then you want it to 
survive and will be using any buffering data).

I guess we could also allow browsers to even discard things in the session 
history that do have references to them, but long-term it might be better 
just to have the browsers support that, since it doesn't seem 
intrinsically impossible to do -- it's just something that is typically in 
a hairy part of code, because it's never been specced before. There's 
bound to be other things that need changing as we move all the browsers to 
a convergence point in this area, regardless of what we make the spec say.

I've fixed window.parent and window.top to return window.self, and made a 
few other fixes for things I'd overlooked.

Indeed, the spec had the same problem!

Yeah, that's the real question.


&gt;<i> [...] this does raise the question of when it's OK to gc the iframe.
</I>
This is defined. In particular, since the event loop stops processing 
tasks for the ungrafted nested browsing context, there's no risk of 
scripts suddenly running in its context, and there's no browser-managed 
strong reference to the browsing context (much like when a document goes 
into session history).

This would be scary; top-level browsing contexts have various privileges 
that subframes don't have, and we wouldn't want to give them to a window 
that was invisible to the user.

</I>
The spec says that basically anything you can observe in the DOM is a 
strong reference, including e.g. frameElement. So there's no race 
condition here.

This is as well-defined in the spec as it is for the case of sibling

This is already a problem since you can move an &lt;embed&gt; around directly.
