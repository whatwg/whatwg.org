</I>
I disagree with the premise that the page has to implement its own 
progress indicator. The browser should do that.

</I>
It seems like the better solution is just to have the browser display an 
obvious progress bar as it uploads the file.


&gt;<i> I agree! I'd love to see browsers provide their own information in a

</I>&gt;<i> and information allows web developers the option to display such

</I>
Actually handling the submission process using XHR is only a few lines of 
code; probably about as many lines of code as it would take to display a 
progress bar if we exposed progress events for the form submission itself. 
So it's not clear to me that we would gain much by doing that.

</I>&gt;<i> The onuploadprogress event could either be on the &lt;form&gt; or on the

</I>&gt;<i> a time.
</I>
The problem is that the browser is allowed to blow away the page as soon 
as the server starts responding, which it can do before the entire upload 
has been received, as far as I can tell. So the feature could be somewhat 
unreliable. I think it's better to give authors direct control over the 
entire process using the XMLHttpRequest form submission feature.

</I>
We could, but in general we try to not give requirements for things that 
aren't required for interoperability. Giving UI requirements would not 
really do any good since browsers would just ignore them (they'd have no 
incentive to obey them if they disagreed with them, and if they agree with 
them, putting them in the spec wouldn't give them any more incentive than 
they have already).

</I>
It's not clear to me that the benefit is that great. We're talking about 
half a dozen lines of code here.


&gt;<i> I don't expect anything frankly, I only hope :). But I'm not hoping for

</I>
Adding it to the spec doesn't do anything if it doesn't get added to 
implementations also. Given that UAs haven't made upload feedback a 
priority, why would they make events for upload a priority? It's more or 
less the same difficulty in practice.
