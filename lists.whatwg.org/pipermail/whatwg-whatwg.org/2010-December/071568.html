I'm looking forward to some standardization effort on this point.

This one?

On this point I can only say that I think that javascript: in CSS should  
also not execute, and doesn't in Opera (before or after my changes).

&gt;&gt;<i> Right, these aren't inlines, in Opera terminology at least. As far as I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can see the spec agrees on this, as frames/iframes have their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsing contexts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So do &lt;object&gt;s, sometimes, right?
</I>
Yes, but as far as I can tell from the algorithm [1], the browsing context  
isn't created until step 8, after the URL in data=&quot;&quot; has been resolved and  
fetched. In other words, at the time the steps for handling javascript:  
[2] are run, there's no browsing context, and it will be treated as any  
other inline. This is a good thing IMO, as it would be quite confusing if  
the context in which the script executed depended on the expected type of  
the &lt;object&gt; content.

The spec change that I'm suggesting is to remove the case &quot;If the Document  
object of the element, attribute, or style sheet from which the  
javascript: URL was reached has an associated browsing context&quot;, which  
would mean (among other things) that &lt;object data=&quot;javscript:...&quot;&gt; would  
never execute. But again, let's wait a little bit longer and see if any  
compat issues arise.
