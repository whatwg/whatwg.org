</I>&gt;<i> processes it in some way. All is fine and dandy, as long as everybody is

</I>&gt;<i> that process alone.
</I>Bluetooth was an example. We were discussing a serial connection in general.
It could be BT or RSR232/USB or anything else. I was not thinking specifically
about a web app that would do that, I was just thinking that talking to
a serial device could be very handy.

&gt;<i> Say someone creates a web app that applies a process to weather  
</I>&gt;<i> information gathered from an hypothetical Weather-o-Meter connected via  
</I>&gt;<i> Bluetooth. Say I'm doing a research on global warming and the Gulf stream,  
</I>&gt;<i> and want to apply that process to weather information gathered from all  
</I>&gt;<i> over the country. Even if all the weather stations in Iceland are using  
</I>&gt;<i> Weather-o-Meter, I won't receive the information over Bluetooth. For this  
</I>&gt;<i> to work weather information gathered on the weather stations must be  
</I>&gt;<i> encoded in a standardized format, transferred to me over a network for me  
</I>&gt;<i> to decode and apply said process to. I'm thusly required to persuade the  
</I>&gt;<i> author to add an alternative input mechanism to the app, hack my Bluetooth  
</I>&gt;<i> stack and create a virtual Bluetooth device or rewrite the app.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Does the OS need to know how to fetch this information?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the purpose of an OS is to abstract and multiplex hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> Does a web app need to know how to fetch this information?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Is a browser plugin really a better idea? Which browser/version? Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how is the page going to fetch that? How secure is that? Can't another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page do it? This reminds me the use of &lt;embed&gt; which I personally hate.
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that a browser plugin would the wrong approach, but I argue that a  
</I>&gt;<i> web page would be as well. I can't imagine a scenario where I'm developing  
</I>&gt;<i> software support for a Bluetooth weather station and I figure: &quot;Heck, I  
</I>&gt;<i> should put a web browser between the Bluetooth stack and the weather  
</I>&gt;<i> station abstraction.&quot;
</I>Again, the app should not (but maybe could) listen for
bluetooth-specific devices. If you develop web apps you wouldn't say
that, it would be more like: &quot;Heck, I have a wonderfull web app and now
I have to do some kind of abstraction on several diferent OS
(win,unix,..) so I can in some way export the bluetooth information to
the browser.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; I hope this kind of example enlights some people to forget about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; storage, cameras, keyboards and all the stuff you can get in any general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology store.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Where do you draw the line? What's inherently different about hardware you  
</I>&gt;<i> can find in general technology stores?
</I>General technology stores: cameras, lcds, mouses, keyboards,
microphones. We're not talking about this kind of devices.

&gt;<i> Why should there even be so  
</I>&gt;<i> low-level webapps that they interface with hardware? HTML forms don't care  
</I>&gt;<i> if their input comes from a pipe. No web technology should.
</I>I think I already made my point.
