<PRE>I know it's not effective at the moment; it is a common use case.
QuickTime had the 'badge' ux for years that hardly anyone took advantage of:

<A HREF="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.16/16.02/Feb00QTToolkit/index.html">http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.16/16.02/Feb00QTToolkit/index.html</A>

What we're seeing on the web is a converged implementation of the
YouTube-like overlaid grey play button, but this is effectively
reimplemented independently by each video site that enables embedding.

As we see HTML used declaratively for long-form works like ebooks on lower
performance devices, having embedded video that doesn't cumulatively absorb
all the memory available is going to be like the old CD-ROM use cases the QT
Badge was meant for.
