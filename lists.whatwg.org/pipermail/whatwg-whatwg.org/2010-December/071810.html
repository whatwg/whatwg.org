More than not making it a priority, FF4 has apparently removed the
progress bar entirely, regressing basic user feedback by a decade or
two.  (Combined with the broken wait cursor in Windows, it's now
impossible to tell if the browser is doing anything at all.)  That's
not HTML5's problem, of course.

That said, at least FF4 and Chrome have both implemented XHR2 progress
events, and this is much more like those than upload feedback, so I
wouldn't rule out it being implemented.

FWIW, I think that duplicating all of XHR2's functionality in forms is
a waste of implementation and spec work.  People should use XHR2 if
they want a greater level of control than simple form submission.  I
think it's typically more than ten lines of code to make it work
(server-side API support is often needed, too), but it seems better
than starting to duplicate APIs.
