This is by design. You shouldn't need to know the actual device pixel 
depth, as far as I can tell. What's the use case?

You get this automatically, if you specify the size of the canvas in CSS 
pixels.


&gt;<i> and possibly swapping in different image assets from JS.

That's an interesting use case.

</I>
Any UI that is based on being able to zoom content (e.g. maps is another 
one) would presumably have in-page zoom separate from UA zoom, but you'd 
still want to be able to change the UA zoom (changing the CSS pixel size, 
essentially), since you would want to be able to zoom the page UI itself.

</I>
I could see a need to swap image assets so that the UA gets the assets 
that are the highest resolution assest appropriate for the device at the 
current zoom.

It seems that the best way to do that is to use a technique similar to 
what operating systems use for icons and cursors: have image files that 
expose all the various sizes of data, and then have the UA pick the right 
size when painting the image. That seems out of scope for HTML, though.

</I>&gt;<i> agnostic. When a user zooms in, I need to be able to reprint my fillText 
</I>&gt;<i> to match their resolution.
</I>
When the zoom changes, you should get a resize event, so in theory you 
can already do that. (Or use SVG.)

The 'resize' event is an issue for one of Anne's specs, though.

[snip many e-mails that didn't really cover use cases]

What you describe here is essentially what I would expect of all 
implementations. It is certainly within the realm of what is allowed by 
the specs.

That's not really about zoom, it's about native resolution -- e.g. if the 
user printed the page, you'd want to provide data in the printer's native 
resolution rather than the screen's. That's something that you'd want to 
do regardless of JS being enabled or not, so it can't be a scripting API 
-- it has to be an underlying feature of the graphics rendering. The 
aforementioned model whereby graphics come in multiple resolutions seems 
like the best way to solve this problem for bitmap data; for vector data, 
you'd just want to use something like SVG.

Either way, this seems like a graphics layer issue, not an HTML issue. 
It could be solved using media queries at the image level, for instance.
