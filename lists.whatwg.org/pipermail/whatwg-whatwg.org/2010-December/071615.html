Yes, I understand that.

Your statement relates to a defect in the current flexibility of the 
&quot;context menu&quot;.

I fully understand that, you wouldn't need the context menu to be more 
flexible, if you had access to suggestions, as you have your own custom 
context menu implemented.

Recognizing that &quot;suggestions&quot; can not be shared with the DOM, the 
alternative is to address defects in the context menu.

It seems to me that were the context menu more easily manipulated via 
scripting, your use requirement (having suggestions) would be handled 
without exposing the suggestions to the DOM.

Still, your use case does require that spelling ranges be made available.
