<PRE>Apologies for top posting; I'm on my phone.

One case where posters come back after playback is complete is  when there
are multiple videos on the page, and only one has playback focus at a time,
such as a page of preview movies for longer ones to purchase.

In that case, showing the poster again on blur makes sense conceptually.

It seems that getting back into the pre-playback state, showing the poster
again would make sense in this context.

That would imply adding an unload() method that reverted to that state, and
could be used to make any cached media data purgeable in favour of another
video that is subsequently loaded.

</I>That would be annoying in a different way -- it would mean you couldn't

We could make the spec more precise and require that a particular
behaviour occur before playback has ever happened and another after
playback has ever happened, but in practice I think that there is only one
behaviour that is useful and desireable enough that all browsers will
implement it, and we don't gain much by making the other more esotecir
behaviours non-conforming for those few people who would prefer it the
other way. (In general it is considered bad form to require particular UI
unless there is a strong reason to do so.)

It could, yes, according to the spec today, but it also causes the whole
video to reload from the network (modulo caching).

</I>They're not independent. They're part of the same element.

load() just tells the &lt;video&gt; element to restart. load() is implicitly
called when you create the &lt;video&gt; element, it's what makes the video
load in the first place. It makes sense that it would reset the playback
position, poster, etc.

</I>Using a changing URL to avoid someone referencing your video doesn't seem
like an especially good design. I don't think we should optimise the spec
to support such a design.

</I>That's not how standardisation works. We don't add all the features for
which we can't find compelling arguments _against_, we only add features
for which we can find compelling arguments _for_. Compelling arguments
usually come in the form of use cases (e.g. large numbers of sites that
are working around the lack of a feature), or compatibility (e.g. lots
of browsers doing something).
