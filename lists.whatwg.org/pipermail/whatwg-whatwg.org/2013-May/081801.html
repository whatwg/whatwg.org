Do you have a suggestion?

I don't think this is of particular importance.

&gt;<i> The important thing (IMHO) to remember here regarding the title is that

</I>
Three, actually.

I don't see what's important about that, though.

&gt;<i> The document must be intended as a differentiation between the entire
</I>&gt;<i> version of HTML4, since it does not specify a specific subversion to  
</I>&gt;<i> diff?
</I>&gt;<i> However, it links to the HTML 4.01 specification in the &quot;References&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> section.  If this is *only* a diff between HTML 4.01 and the living
</I>&gt;<i> standard, perhaps the title should then be &quot;HTML differences from HTML
</I>&gt;<i> 4.01&quot; so that the document has additional meaning.  If there are
</I>&gt;<i> differences between HTML 4.0, HTML 4.01, *and* HTML5 in the same section  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the document, those should probably be appropriately marked.
</I>
HTML 4.01 is intended. The differences between revisions of HTML4 is out  
of scope.

The W3C version will have the same title.

&gt;<i> In that case, &quot;Differences between HTML and HTML4&quot; sounds nice as well.

That doesn't seem to address Jukka's concern.

&gt;<i> The only reservation I have is that the &quot;from&quot; preposition connotates  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> HTML follows HTML4 (which it does, in a manner of speaking), whereas the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;between&quot; preposition implies a comparison among similar but equal ideas.
</I>
That suggests &quot;from&quot; is better. :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah.  The document scope [1] explains why it uses &quot;HTML&quot; in the title as

</I>&gt;<i> No, it only says *that* it uses &quot;HTML&quot; to refer to &quot;the W3C HTML5

</I>
It's mostly for readability. Noted in the document.

&gt;<i> &quot;HTML&quot; has been used through the ages to denote a markup language (and  
</I>&gt;<i> associated definitions) in a broad sense, as opposite to specific  
</I>&gt;<i> versions. This is still the everyday meaning. And a title of a work  
</I>&gt;<i> should be understandable without reading some explanation inside it,  
</I>&gt;<i> saying that some common term has an uncommon meaning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't agree on a proper name, at least call it something like  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;modern HTML&quot;. Or, perhaps more realistically, &quot;near-future HTML&quot;.
</I>
&quot;Modern HTML differences from HTML4&quot;? I'm not convinced that's a win.  
&quot;Near-future&quot; seems wrong since it's more like &quot;current&quot;.

&gt;<i> It's not clear to me why the document is needed in the first place. It  
</I>&gt;<i> would seem to be much more relevant to document in detail the  
</I>&gt;<i> differences between HTML 5, HTML 5.1, and WHATWG Living HTML than to  
</I>&gt;<i> write a rather general document about the differences between them (as  
</I>&gt;<i> if they were a single and stabile specification) and HTML 4.
</I>
Such a document would be useful, but it's not this document. The primary  
focus for this document is what is different from HTML4.
