Fair enough.


&gt;&gt;<i> Trying to brain storm as to what should be done when you click a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notification of a site that is no longer there. Navigating to a URL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was one idea. Starting up an event worker as outlined (roughly) in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://annevankesteren.nl/2013/05/applifying">http://annevankesteren.nl/2013/05/applifying</A> might be a better idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's not a bad idea - as you know from my separate email with you, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> less enamored with using Workers for these kinds of on-demand/background
</I>&gt;<i> footprint tasks, because they are limited in so many ways (can't display a
</I>&gt;<i> visible browsing context, for example). I prefer having instead a page that
</I>&gt;<i> is loaded off-screen, albeit perhaps with a limited lifetime as you describe
</I>&gt;<i> in that page.
</I>
So how would that work if open gmail.com twice, in two distinct
browsing contexts? Long term we want those to be able to use distinct
threads I think, but they should be able to share a single event
page/worker.

Not having the ability to focus (draw attention to) and open windows
does seem like something we should solve. (The cross-origin loading
case you mentioned should really be solved using WebSocket or CORS. I
heard from at least one guy from your app team that they want to move
to something like that long term and the &lt;iframe&gt; thing is mostly a
intermediate hack.)


&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, that's currently not described. You think we should leave that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to developers? That might work, although that leaves the questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the site being closed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, it does. Currently in Chrome we basically punt on this, with the
</I>&gt;<i> expectation that well-behaved pages close their notifications via an
</I>&gt;<i> document.onclose handler. I hadn't really considered the case of the app
</I>&gt;<i> developer wanting their notifications to hang around after the window closes
</I>&gt;<i> and still have some action undertaken when the user clicks on them.
</I>
That seems like something we want to support, no? E.g. you get a push
message, so you open the event page/worker, and that dispatches a
notification, but then you want to kill the event page/worker so it
doesn't continue to use system resources. Couple days later the user
might click the notification and then you'd open the event page/worker
again.
