</I>&gt;<i> No, it only says *that* it uses &quot;HTML&quot; to refer to &quot;the W3C HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> specification, W3C HTML5.1 specification, and the WHATWG HTML standard&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> *Why* it does so is not addressed at all
</I>

You are correct.  The &quot;why&quot; is something that should be addressed.  Perhaps
the document could read:

This document covers the W3C HTML5 specification, W3C HTML5.1
&gt;<i> specification, and the WHATWG HTML standard. In order to simplify the
</I>&gt;<i> readability of this document, these are referred to as if they were a
</I>&gt;<i> single specification: &quot;the HTML specification&quot; or simply &quot;HTML&quot; when
</I>&gt;<i> something applies equally to all of them; otherwise, they are called out
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The WHATWG differentiates, when necessary, by describing the constantly
evolving version of HTML as the &quot;HTML Living Standard&quot;.  The &quot;HTML&quot; that
you describe is this HTML -- it does not refer to specific versions, but
the overall language as it stands currently.

The topical document is good to have as a learning tool, and to broaden the
understanding of when (and sometimes why) certain changes were made between
HTML and one of its previous subversions.

As the WHATWG specification [1] states,

There are numerous differences between this specification (the HTML Living
&gt;<i> Standard) and the W3C version, some minor, some major. Unfortunately these
</I>&gt;<i> are not currently accurately documented anywhere, so there is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> know which are intentional and which are not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you believe that documenting the (constantly evolving) differences
between HTML and its HTML5 and HTML5.1 subsets would be relevant, please do
so!  It would be a great thing to be able to reference such a document.
