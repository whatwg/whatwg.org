I made some suggestions, which you comment later, but I will make 
another one here.

&gt;&gt;<i> Besides, the spelling is &quot;HTML 4&quot;. Especially if you think HTML 4 is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this is of particular importance.
</I>
If it isn't, why not use the correct spelling? When referring to 
specifications, it is usually a good idea to use their own spelling, 
even when it is odd and confusing.

&gt;<i> HTML 4.01 is intended. The differences between revisions of HTML4 is out
</I>&gt;<i> of scope.
</I>
Then the heading should say &quot;HTML 4.01&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;HTML&quot; has been used through the ages to denote a markup language (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associated definitions) in a broad sense, as opposite to specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions. This is still the everyday meaning. And a title of a work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be understandable without reading some explanation inside it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saying that some common term has an uncommon meaning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you can't agree on a proper name, at least call it something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;modern HTML&quot;. Or, perhaps more realistically, &quot;near-future HTML&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Modern HTML differences from HTML4&quot;? I'm not convinced that's a win.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Near-future&quot; seems wrong since it's more like &quot;current&quot;.
</I>
The difficulty here directly reflects the vague nature of HTML5: it 
partly tries to describe HTML as actually implemented and partly 
specifies features that should (or &quot;shall&quot;) be implemented. Hence it is 
both modern and (intended to be) near-future.

But the fundamental difficulty is that you are trying to describe a 
specific version, or set of versions, of HTML without giving it a proper 
name or version number.

Since WHATWG does not use a proper name for its version (the title is 
just &quot;HTML&quot;), I think the only way to refer to it properly is to prefix 
it with &quot;WHATWG&quot;. This would lead to the title

&quot;Differences of HTML5 and WHATWG HTML from HTML 4.01&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> It's not clear to me why the document is needed in the first place. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would seem to be much more relevant to document in detail the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differences between HTML 5, HTML 5.1, and WHATWG Living HTML than to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write a rather general document about the differences between them (as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if they were a single and stabile specification) and HTML 4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such a document would be useful, but it's not this document. The primary
</I>&gt;<i> focus for this document is what is different from HTML4.
</I>
But why? What is the purpose of this document? This is relevant to 
naming it, and to the content too, of course. Now it is neither a 
reliable comparison with links the relevant clauses nor an overview - it 
has too many details, to begin with. Is this for authors who consider 
moving from HTML 4.01 to HTML 5? Then I think it should primarily 
specify what HTML 4.01 features are forbidden in HTML 5, then the 
extensions.
