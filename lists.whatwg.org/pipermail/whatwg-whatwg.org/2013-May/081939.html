Correct.

Correct.

&gt;<i> 3)  Even after a page has been placed in the page cache it can be evicted from the page cache for various reasons (again, at least in Gecko).
</I>
Correct.  Of course note that pages that have been placed in the page cache that are evicted have no visibility that the eviction occurred (at least in WebKit)

&gt;<i> How does the firing of visibilitychange events after pagehide affect things here in an undesirable way?
</I>
I can answer this in two buckets.

---

Bucket 1 - &#8220;Pages not going in to the page cache&#8221;

Let me ask you this - Are there any (reasonable) pages in the wild that (reasonably) expect to do anything *after* the unload event is fired?  I would say no, probably not.

If a page listens to pagehide instead of unload, then they are not reasonably expecting to do anything after &quot;pagehide with persisted set to false&#8221; is fired.  Especially since &#8220;pagehide with persisted set to false&#8221; was identical to &#8220;unload&#8221; until this change in the spec.

Would it have made sense for page-vis to put the visibilitychanged event *after* unload?  I don&#8217;t think so.  No author would expect that or find it very useful.

So I still cannot see how having it after &quot;pagehide with persisted set to false&#8221; is the right call.  Maybe authors writing to the spec might expect it, but they wouldn&#8217;t find it very useful.

---

Bucket 2 - &#8220;Pages going in to the page cache&#8221;

The long standing design goals and implementation of our page cache prevents us from delivering these events to a page that was just sent &#8220;pagehide with persisted set to true&#8221;.

So it&#8217;s undesirable for two reasons:
1 - We can&#8217;t meet the spec.
2 - Authors can&#8217;t get the possible benefit that were available to them if the spec was reasonable in sending visibilitychanged before pagehide instead of after.
