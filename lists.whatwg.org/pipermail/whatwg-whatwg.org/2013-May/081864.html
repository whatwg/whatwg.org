Thanks. I think this is probably the most interesting bit. Next is
whether doing it on the main thread would be actively hostile to a
future parallel world.


&gt;&gt;<i> Not having the ability to focus (draw attention to) and open windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does seem like something we should solve. (The cross-origin loading

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intermediate hack.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &lt;iframe&gt; thing (and other &lt;script&gt;-based solutions like JSONP) are
</I>&gt;<i> definitely hacks, but they are hacks with a fairly long history in the web
</I>&gt;<i> world. Agreed about CORS, although we've been talking about CORS support in
</I>&gt;<i> workers for a while now with no implementations AFAIK - maybe we just need a
</I>&gt;<i> compelling feature like this to drive teams to actually build it.
</I>
There's a difference between cross-origin workers and cross-origin
fetching from workers. I meant the latter.


&gt;&gt;<i> That seems like something we want to support, no? E.g. you get a push
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message, so you open the event page/worker, and that dispatches a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notification, but then you want to kill the event page/worker so it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't continue to use system resources. Couple days later the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might click the notification and then you'd open the event page/worker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, I think this is a valid use case once you support event
</I>&gt;<i> pages/workers as targets for notifications (it also probably has some uses
</I>&gt;<i> for things like server-initiated notifications, where the server can specify
</I>&gt;<i> a URL to navigate to when the user clicks, although I've never really paid
</I>&gt;<i> attention to the server-initiated notification discussions so I don't quite
</I>&gt;<i> follow their use cases).
</I>
I think even if we didn't have event pages/workers we'd still want to
support end-user notifications that remain in the notification center
after the page has been closed (or crashed or whatever). Use cases for
push notifications are basically &quot;new email&quot;, &quot;new instant message&quot;,
&quot;new photo from friend&quot;, while the page/app is not open (communicating
the push notifications should probably be done through either end-user
notifications or spawning some kind of window (although the latter
would be pretty disruptive).
