</I>&gt;<i> feature being proposed here? Same question for the Firefox and Firefox-
</I>&gt;<i> OS features that motivate creating a new feature here.
</I>
If this feature uses the &quot;load' event, as long as those tools listen
to &quot;load&quot;, that is enough: when they receive that event, the page
should be rendered in the state the web site developer wanted.

If a use case is identified that makes it difficult to use the
existing &quot;load&quot; event, then the tools would need to listen to a new
event. They would also need to inspect the document state (maybe by
checking for a &quot;loading&quot; attribute on the documentElement?) to know if
this new event is in play.

&gt;<i> Similarily, it would be helpful to approach the problem from the per-
</I>&gt;<i> spective of content creators. Let's say you have a website, and any new
</I>&gt;<i> visitor gets to see an overlay that &quot;encourages&quot; them to &quot;sign up with
</I>&gt;<i> Acme&quot;. When would this site signal that it is &quot;ready&quot; for the purposes
</I>&gt;<i> I've mentioned? And would all of the implementations cited above wait
</I>&gt;<i> for this signal?
</I>
If the &quot;load&quot; event approach was used, the web site would:

* call document.delayLoadEvent() during JS execution (needs to happen
before the browser would normally trigger the load event).
* Once the Acme overlay DOM element was inserted, call
document.stopDelayingLoadEvent()
* The platform waits for any images/resources for the current DOM to
finish loading. It then fires the normal document load event.

For tools that are listening:

* Just listen for the &quot;load&quot; event for the document.

---

If a separate event/trigger instead of &quot;load&quot; is used, then I am not
exactly sure what is needed. One guess:

For the web site:

* stamp the DOM in some way to indicate this new event would be fired,
perhaps add the &quot;loading&quot; attribute to the documentElement.
* insert the Acme overlay DOM element, then remove the attribute.
* The platform waits for any images/resources for the current DOM to
finish loading (?) then fire &quot;appload&quot; event?

For tools that are listening:

* Inspect the state of the page, looking to see if there is a
&quot;loading&quot; attribute in play. Listen for both &quot;load&quot; and &quot;appload&quot;, and
if the &quot;loading&quot; attribute was detected, wait for the &quot;appload&quot; event.

In fact, the tool needs to discount &quot;load&quot; if the page detects
&quot;appload&quot; is in play as it may fire. (So, in response to one of
David's comments, trying to fallback to &quot;load&quot; would not be
feasible/detectable).
