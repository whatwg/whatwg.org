OK, that's at least a reasonable argument for the behavior.  ;)

&gt;<i> OK, technically, the way I phrased it, yes. But what I meant was that

</I>
Yes, but the key is _who_ is making the suggestion and why.

&gt;<i> That seems like quite a sophisticated attack that relies on a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> things falling into place all at once.
</I>
Uh... yes.  Like most browser exploits.

&gt;<i> Then I think it is the responsibility of the UA to sniff the file and
</I>&gt;<i> protect the user from such attempts to mislead.
</I>
This is not trivial, since sniffing can easily fail on files that are 
both HTML and png or both HTML and exe at the same time.  There's a good 
bit of research on things like this.

&gt;<i> There is a price to freedom, as they say. We shouldn't let a few
</I>&gt;<i> rotten apples spoil the whole bunch.
</I>
If it's going to open users to exploits.... we do it all the time.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure I have the resources to do extensive real-world testing
</I>&gt;<i> of this (and that documentation suggests it has been superseded in
</I>&gt;<i> more modern OSes), but I don't think it would be unreasonable for the
</I>&gt;<i> UA to override or augment the filename suggested by the @download
</I>&gt;<i> attribute it if determines that it would not be in the best interest
</I>&gt;<i> of the user to use the suggested filename unchanged.
</I>
Phrased that way, using the Content-Disposition filename is a perfectly 
valid &quot;override if not in the best interest of the user&quot; behavior, fwiw.
