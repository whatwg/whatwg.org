<PRE>I realize this is an old thread, so apologies if this has already been
resolved. The discussion that originally followed seemed to have
gotten off track, so I wanted to try to clarify things.

First off, there are two factors to consider:
(1) Whether to download the file or display it.
(2) What filename to suggest for the file when it is downloaded.

In the general case, with a normal &lt;a href&gt; and no Content-Disposition
header (or the plain 'Content-Disposition: inline' header, listed as
(1) originally), the answers are:
(1) Display it.
(2) Whatever the filename on the server is (e.g. &quot;page.txt&quot; or
&quot;example.php&quot;), modulo OS restrictions.

In the case of a normal &lt;a href&gt; and a 'Content-Disposition: inline;
filename=&quot;B.txt&quot;' header (listed as (2) originally), the answers are:
(1) Display it.
(2) &quot;B.txt&quot;

Changing the disposition type doesn't change much, with a normal &lt;a
href&gt; and a 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;B.txt&quot;' header
(listed as (3) originally):
(1) Download it.
(2) &quot;B.txt&quot;

So now, the question is, what effect does a @download attribute have?
Nothing too surprising.

An empty @download attribute would override the 1st factors above so
that they are always &quot;Download it.&quot;

A @download attribute with a value would override both factors, like so:
(1) Download it.
(2) &quot;A.txt&quot;

Thus, the @download attribute acts to override the Content-Disposition
header, giving the following hierarchy:


@download &gt; Content-Disposition &gt; URL


Or, in pseudocode (with the assumption that if X has Y, then X is also present):


disposition_type = ( @download is present ) ? &quot;attachment&quot; : ( (
Content-Disposition header is present ) ? Content-Disposition
disposition type : &quot;inline&quot; );
suggested_filename = ( @download has a value ) ? value of @download :
( ( Content-Disposition has filename parameter ) ? Content-Disposition
filename value : filename from URL );


I don't see what the security concerns might be: There is no
difference here than what is already available, except that there's
now an additional way to specify it. AFAICT, there are no content
sniffing or cross-domain issues at play. Browsers already give strange
results when saving a file; they don't do any file extension vs. file
format checking. (For example, the output of a .php or .cgi or .py
file on a server is usually HTML, yet browsers don't generally make
any attempt to change the file extension to .html when saving the
file, IME.)

Does this make sense? Am I missing anything?

Regards,
Gordon
