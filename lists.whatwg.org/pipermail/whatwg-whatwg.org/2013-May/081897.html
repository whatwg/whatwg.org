<PRE>Thanks for sharing your experience, Paul.
A few questions:
* Do you think that under the conditions I mentioned in the initial post
(&quot;media&quot; works only on async scripts without dependencies, since running
order can be pretty much anything), things would have been better in your
case?
* Can't the media dependant scripts &quot;clean out&quot; the scripts that already
ran and are no longer relevant for current form factor?
* Do you have any opinions on re-running scripts upon media change? (such
as orientation change)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How bad is the current situation with JS-based loaders? I would expect a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; JS-based loader and the couple of feature-detection tests to be rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; small as well as heavily cachable, so not that awful for performance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JS based loaders have several drawbacks:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * JS files are not discovered by the preloader, which means the browsers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't prioirtize their download appropriately.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * They require JS inlining, which will become significantly harder with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CSP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (JS nonces make it possible, but it'd require server side logic)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Arguably, attributes make authoring easier, which may mean authors are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more likely to avoid useless JS downloads.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure I understand your point about preloading scripts parsing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you want them to be preparsed (which costs in battery as you mention) or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; not preparsed (which will result in longer time when actually needing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; script)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was referring to HTML parsing (so the discvery of JS resources in HTML),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not the parsing/execution of the JS resources themselves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  How much time can be expected to be gained from such a feature given the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; state-of-the-art JS loaders?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Overall, what is the expected gain between a JS-based loader and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; declarative media-aware loader? 1ms? 100ms?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; While the expected gain may vary per site, I'd estimate that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the area of hundreds of ms for most sites. A recent study by Google
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (addressing this specific issue) showed that the PreloadScanner gives ~20%
