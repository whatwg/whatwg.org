<PRE>Le 06/05/2013 21:35, James Burke a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> In my experience as a JS library provider (first with dojo and more
</I>&gt;<i> recently with requirejs), JS scripts heavily favor binding to
</I>&gt;<i> DOMContentLoaded over document load to do work. DOMContentLoaded is
</I>&gt;<i> also what jQuery's ready() uses, which I expect is what most sites
</I>&gt;<i> that use jQuery use.
</I>If the UA load event is delayed, I guess the delayed value is what is 
registered in performance.timing [1]. Then, how do people keep track of 
their performance for the actual UA load event? I would recommend 
separating the &quot;app ready&quot; mechanism from the UA load event.

&gt;<i> It would be good to do a survey of existing public source to verify
</I>&gt;<i> the uses of document load vs. DOMContentLoaded. Anyone know if this
</I>&gt;<i> has been done before?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just going on my experience (admittedly a limited data set): anything
</I>&gt;<i> that actually binds to document load really wants to know when &quot;all
</I>&gt;<i> resources loaded (images/iframes) and page is considered complete&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which fits with the motivations of this new capability.
</I>An app could be considered complete before the UA load event (hidden 
iframe hasn't finished loading, below-the-fold images haven't fully 
loaded yet, etc.)
Delaying the load event doesn't take that into account.

&gt;<i> 2) Use paired JS API (document.delayLoadEvent and
</I>&gt;<i> document.stopDelayingLoadEvent being one example) vs. setting an html
</I>&gt;<i> attribute &quot;loading&quot; and removal the attribute trigger the event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The JS API allows less coordination among multiple scripts. I can see
</I>&gt;<i> this becoming more important with Web Components. The HTML attribute
</I>&gt;<i> loading solution would likely push that API into library-specific APIs
</I>&gt;<i> use cases, which just seems to result in the same outcome, but in ways
</I>&gt;<i> that make it harder to use scripts from disparate sources -- the
</I>&gt;<i> scripts would need to buy into library-specific APIs.
</I>Light versions of Caja [2][3] would allow each independent components to 
both use standard APIs and coordinate easily.
Specifically for Web Component, maybe each component could have a 
component-wide setting to tell it's ready. That probably even makes a 
lot of sense.

&gt;<i> 3) What about errors?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would expect this to work how errors affect onload notification now.
</I>&gt;<i> The behavior/consequences seem to be the same for paired JS API vs.
</I>&gt;<i> attribute approach.
</I>Agreed.

&gt;<i> If the concern is about an async script erroring out between the
</I>&gt;<i> paired calls/addition and removal of an attribute, then perhaps any
</I>&gt;<i> uncaught error ends up triggering the same behavior that occurs now
</I>&gt;<i> when there is an error during onload determination.
</I>In case a component fails to notice it's ready, having the &quot;app 
readiness&quot; event separated from the UA &quot;load&quot; event would allow 
outsiders to use the UA &quot;load&quot; as fallback (which is the current best 
approximation).


&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;<i> Summary
</I>&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am fine with the paired JS API approach tied to document load, as a
</I>&gt;<i> web app developer and consumer of the API. I do not have a particular
</I>&gt;<i> favored design of what that paired API looks like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is agreement on focusing on a paired JS API and for it being
</I>&gt;<i> tied to onload, perhaps the API discussion could begin.
</I>I still strongly believe the UA load event should be kept out of this 
discussion and a new independent thing should be added instead.

Thanks,

David
