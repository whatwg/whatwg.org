agreed.

&gt;<i> Semantic markup is about what we think not what we see;

agreed.

&gt;<i> and what we think is difficult to deduce unambiguously from what we

</I>
agreed.

but there's a point that we might take into consideration: People.
People do not want spend time structuring information, only a  
minority like me.
If the only way to edit structured document is hand coding then it  
will fail. Always. Microformats/RDF have the same problem. It is too  
complicated to hand edit. So let's look around us and identify when  
people do structure editing:

- Spreadsheet software (structured tables)
- Templates in word processing tools
- addressbooks (form-oriented applications)
- DB applications with UI
- Weblogs (only title, content, and category)

They are all based on constraints given by an editing template. The  
only way to do structure editing is to have a normalized templating  
language, which can trigger specific UI for editing. People use this  
because they can have an immediate benefit of their editing.


&gt;<i> Also, the sheer variation of browsers and their configuration  
</I>&gt;<i> ensures that
</I>&gt;<i> others will rarely see the same thing anyway.
</I>
Not a problem. I was answering to the message which was advocating  
for hand coding. Hand coding addresses only a minority of Web  
technologies users.

&gt;<i> With that caveat, especially given the fact that most browsers compete
</I>&gt;<i> to make textarea as unusable as possible, allowing users to open an
</I>&gt;<i> external editor for text inputs and textarea is an extremely sane  
</I>&gt;<i> idea.
</I>&gt;<i> It's suggested by UUAG:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10-TECHS/topics.html#form-control-orientation">http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10-TECHS/topics.html#form-control-orientation</A>
</I>
Yep I think that would be a move forward. A real one.
It would likely to remind the time of OpenDoc/CyberDog on Mac OS 8  
for example

&gt;<i> Web Forms 2.0 tries to help by including a type attribute. This is
</I>&gt;<i> better than nothing, but it's not great for two reasons. First,  
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> usually user-contributed content comes in the form of parts of  
</I>&gt;<i> documents
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. a string of HTML) not whole documents. Second, because text/html
</I>&gt;<i> is not nearly specific enough to cover even the different branches of
</I>&gt;<i> (X)HTML, let alone the microformats and so forth.
</I>
Challenges indeed.

&gt;<i> CURRENT EXTERNAL EDITORS:

Thanks for all the references. Very helpful.

&gt;<i> Apparently, you can open a textarea in OmniWeb with TextMate using the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Edit in Textmate&quot; Cocoa input manager:
</I>[&#8230;]
&gt;<i> Safari also uses Cocoa, so this will work there too; it may also  
</I>&gt;<i> work in
</I>&gt;<i> Camino, though not as seamlessly:
</I>
Edit in textmate doesn't work in
	- Camino
	- Firefox
But it works perfectly in
	- Safari.
