See the mail I just sent in response to Ian.

&gt;<i> Consider hAtom.  If you went by media types alone, you'd be confronted with;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link type=&quot;text/html&quot; href=&quot;hatom.html&quot; /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not particularly useful for subscription (or anything else for that
</I>&gt;<i> matter) is it?
</I>
How does hatom.html relates to the current page? Is it an alternate?
is it a &quot;container&quot; (rel=&quot;up&quot;, rel=&quot;index&quot;)? why would I subscribe to
such a thing if I don't know what it is about?
(also, note that rel=&quot;&quot; is required for &lt;link&gt; elements).

&gt;<i> This would be better;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;feed&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; href=&quot;hatom.html&quot; /&gt;
</I>
It still doesn't tell me what it has to do with the page I'm looking at.

I do agree there is a &quot;problem&quot; in these cases, and that's why I
originally proposed keeping a rel=&quot;feed&quot;, but with a clear definition
as a relationship (opposed to a &quot;kind of resource I'm linking to&quot;).

&gt;<i> Autodiscovery should ideally be based primarily on link types, and
</I>&gt;<i> only secondarily - as an optimization - on media types.  Even this
</I>&gt;<i> should work;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;feed&quot; href=&quot;hatom.html&quot; /&gt;
</I>
As long as hatom.html is a feed where the current page is (or has
been) linked to as an &quot;item&quot;.
If you are already looking at hatom.html, your hAtom-aware browser
should already provide you with a &quot;subscribe to this page&quot;
link/button/etc.
If you can't describe the relationship between the current page and
hatom.html, there is little chance that this is a resource of interest
and that the person reading the page will subscribe to it (at least
without &quot;visiting&quot; it).

With rel=&quot;feed&quot; as a real relationship (&#224; la rel=&quot;index&quot;),
autodiscovery can be (as it should have already been) based on media
types (am I able to subscribe to such a thing?) *or* rel=&quot;feed&quot;, with
an equal &quot;priority&quot;.
If it appears than my proposed rel=&quot;feed&quot; really is identical to
rel=&quot;index&quot;, then a new mean should be found (e.g. a new attribute
&lt;link rel=&quot;index&quot; href=&quot;hatom.html&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; subscribable&gt;)

Saying &quot;this is something you can subscribe to (it's a feed)&quot; is not
talking about relationships. On the contrary, saying &quot;this is an
'index' and it incidentally is something you can subscribe to (it's a
feed; either by using the 'type' attribute an hypothetical
'subscribable' attribute)&quot; is.
