Maybe. Or perhaps the narrator/stage descriptions should be part treated
as another interlocutor. Or perhaps we need an element (&lt;action /&gt;,
&lt;stage-direction /&gt;, &lt;narration /&gt; ?) for such descriptions; which
should be capable of being both block and inline. You can have short
stage descriptions actually intermixed with dialogue. Here's a good
example from Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan:

&gt;<i> MRS. ERLYNNE.  [With a note of irony in her voice.]  To bid good-bye
</I>&gt;<i> to my dear daughter, of course.  [LORD WINDERMERE bites his under lip
</I>&gt;<i> in anger.  MRS. ERLYNNE looks at him, and her voice and manner become
</I>&gt;<i> serious.  In her accents at she talks there is a note of deep tragedy.
</I>&gt;<i> For a moment she reveals herself.]  Oh, don&#8217;t imagine I am going to
</I>&gt;<i> have a pathetic scene with her, weep on her neck and tell her who I
</I>&gt;<i> am, and all that kind of thing.  I have no ambition to play the part
</I>&gt;<i> of a mother.  Only once in my life like I known a mother&#8217;s feelings.
</I>&gt;<i> That was last night.  They were terrible - they made me suffer - they
</I>&gt;<i> made me suffer too much.  For twenty years, as you say, I have lived
</I>&gt;<i> childless, - I want to live childless still.  [Hiding her feelings
</I>&gt;<i> with a trivial laugh.]  Besides, my dear Windermere, how on earth
</I>&gt;<i> could I pose as a mother with a grown-up daughter?  Margaret is
</I>&gt;<i> twenty-one, and I have never admitted that I am more than twenty-nine,
</I>&gt;<i> or thirty at the most.  Twenty-nine when there are pink shades, thirty
</I>&gt;<i> when there are not.  So you see what difficulties it would involve.
</I>&gt;<i> No, as far as I am concerned, let your wife cherish the memory of this
</I>&gt;<i> dead, stainless mother.  Why should I interfere with her illusions?  I
</I>&gt;<i> find it hard enough to keep my own.  I lost one illusion last night.
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I had no heart.  I find I have, and a heart doesn&#8217;t suit me,
</I>&gt;<i> Windermere.  Somehow it doesn&#8217;t go with modern dress.  It makes one
</I>&gt;<i> look old.  [Takes up hand-mirror from table and looks into it.]  And
</I>&gt;<i> it spoils one&#8217;s career at critical moments.
