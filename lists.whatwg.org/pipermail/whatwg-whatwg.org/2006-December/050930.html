Pingback supports in-page markup, though (rel=pingback). That could easily 
be extended to work on a per-&lt;article&gt; basis rather than per-page. You 
certainly don't have to go to RDF to do what Trackback does, HTML already 
has features to do it more easily (and more accessibly). That's all I'm 
trying to say here.

Fair point. Maybe we should disallow paragraphs from holding structured 
inline content after all.


&gt;<i> Past attempts to address this (XHTML1.x then XHTML2) clearly didn't

</I>&gt;<i> extensibility. That doesn't mean that it isn't possible, it just means 
</I>&gt;<i> that it wasn't a goal of those teams, and therefore wasn't attempted.
</I>
Yeah. I think we're trying pretty hard with HTML5, but it's not clear to 
me exactly what the solution should be (or, really, what exactly the 
problem is).

Food for thought, though.
