</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the current technology, this could have been avoided with a single

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that wouldn't help, e.g., Lynx users.
</I>
Over a period of years, I would think that a requirement like the one 
below could be phased in (presuming that one could be found to work).  I 
have no expectation that Lynx would ever support a real XHTML mode.

&gt;&gt;<i> In the longer run, I do believe that an architected simple rule like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    xmlns attributes are invalid on HTML elements except html, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    when found on unrecognized attributes imply style=&quot;display:none&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    unless you recognize the value of this attribute.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... would channel those with insane desires to make extensions into 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing so in a manner that is harmless.  Such a rule might take a year or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two to get widely deployed, but the worst feet-draggers won't be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affected any worse than they were in the days when &lt;table&gt; was young.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are millions of documents that would be &quot;broken&quot; by such a rule, 
</I>&gt;<i> so browser vendors couldn't actually deploy that, sadly. :-(
</I>
Can you identify three independently produced ones?

BTW, I deeply respect the pushback that you give to everybody who thinks 
they want to have a say in the future of HTML.
