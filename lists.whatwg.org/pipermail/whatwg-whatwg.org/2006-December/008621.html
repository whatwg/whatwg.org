I disagree.  The pingback specification does NOT do exactly what the 
trackback specification does.

Pingback discovery works for any media type, does not deal with any 
granularity smaller than a URL.

Trackback discovery is limited to (X)HTML, but can deal with multiple 
entries on a single page.  Here's an example:

   <A HREF="http://scott.userland.com/2005/11/09.html">http://scott.userland.com/2005/11/09.html</A>
