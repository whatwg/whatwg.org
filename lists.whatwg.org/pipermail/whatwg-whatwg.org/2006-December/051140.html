</I>&gt;<i> Why is the DOCTYPE marked &quot;in error&quot; in the former case?
</I>
Because otherwise this document:

   &lt;!DOCTYPEH

...would emit a DOCTYPE that is not in error (since the token would be 
emitted before the bit at the end of the DOCTYPE name state).


&gt;<i> In other words, why would &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; be &quot;in error&quot; while
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!DOCTYPE Html&gt; wouldn't?
</I>
Both would be not in error, because of the sentence at the end of the 
DOCTYPE name state.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not. The &quot;DOCTYPE name state&quot; also has this paragraph: &quot;Then, if

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it also has this note, which is quite confusing: &quot;Because lowercase

</I>
How is it confusing? I would clarify it, but I don't know what is 
confusing.


&gt;<i> It remains that the tokenization stage is a bit confusing&#8230;
</I>
Yes. The tree construction stage is even worse. Just implement it exactly 
as written with no interpretation and you should be fine. ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> So what's the prupose of marking the DOCTYPE &quot;in error&quot; in the &quot;before

</I>&gt;<i> three letters &quot;tml&quot; (case-insensitively)?
</I>
Unexpected EOFs, as noted above.


&gt;<i> So &lt;!doctype html&gt; should not produce a parse rror? or should it?
</I>
No parse error.

</I>&gt;<i> Additional note: as I read this, if the DOCTYPE was previously marked as

</I>&gt;<i> error&quot;.
</I>
Correct. The DOCTYPE being &quot;in error&quot; or not just affects whether to use 
strict mode or quirks mode, it doesn't affect anything else, and in 
particular has no bearing on whether the document itself has parse errors 
or not.


&gt;<i> So I'll just code it so that these are &quot;correct&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!doctype html&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> and every other lowercase/uppercase variant;
</I>&gt;<i> and thiese are &quot;in error&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!doctypehtml&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!DOCTYPEHTML&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> and every other lowercase/uppercase variant.
</I>
No, those four are all treated exactly the same as far as token emission 
goes (they all emit a &quot;correct&quot; DOCTYPE token with name &quot;HTML&quot;). However, 
the bottom two do have parse errors.
