<PRE>The following are honest questions, not rhetorical baiting.

&gt;&gt;<i> Use XHTML, send it with an HTML MIME type, and be happy.
</I>&gt;<i> No!
</I>
	Why not?  What's wrong with doing that?  

Lachlan Hunt wrote:
&gt;&gt;<i> In many more cases, an HTML document or even an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XHTML 1.0 as text/html document is just tag soup.
</I>
	What's wrong with that?

&gt;<i> &gt; There were a few proprietary, incompatible, buggy engines

</I>&gt;<i> OpenSP, which is free software,
</I>
	Will a recommendation to use OpenSP be included in the spec?

</I>
Again, why is this a problem?  It is no different than we have today.

Maybe I should ask a different question. If people write XHTML badly, what
makes you think they will write HTML5 any better?

</I>
As I understand it, serving with the correct mime type for XHTML isn't an
option, assuming you want people to be able to read it with current
browsers, or am I wrong on that?

</I>
And what MIME type should he be using that will work on today's Internet?

I must be missing something...
