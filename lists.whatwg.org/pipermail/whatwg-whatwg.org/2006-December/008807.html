The original problem I was contesting and attempting to solve was that
users would think, incorrectly, that such messages indicated a problem
with Google. You seem to think users would think, correctly, that there
is a problem with the linked page. That's what they should think,
because that's what the message means.

&gt;<i> As for &quot;text/html&quot;, it's just another string of technical jargon added
</I>&gt;<i> by those crazy Google guys.  Wonder what it means?
</I>
Yeah, so do browsers. :)

In any case, it is the job of good design to explain requisite jargon. I
suggest &quot;text/html&quot; because such pages are not HTML, and there's no
point in mislabelling them. If you have a better term, I'm all ears.

&gt;<i> Perhaps you feel I'm exaggerating; in that case, go and ask any
</I>&gt;<i> non&#8211;computer savvy friends or relatives what it means if the HTML on a
</I>&gt;<i> page is corrupted.
</I>
Go ask them what it means if a Word document or hard disk is
&quot;corrupted&quot;. It's the right word for the case; end-users don't need to
have a deep understanding of how web pages or Word documents or file
systems are part together.
