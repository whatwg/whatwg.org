   I think it's clear from the context of my previous message that I was
neither referring specifically to you, nor did I make any claim to know
your thoughts. My claim was that you and others were pushing new
features that collectively amounted to a semantic styling language
without realizing it. If anything, that's believing I know what group of
people are _not_ thinking.

   There's nothing respectful about the tone of your reply. If you
wanted to constructively criticize my previous message, you could have
simply emailed me directly. What you're really trying to do is publicly
shame me, and that's not something you do to someone you respect.
