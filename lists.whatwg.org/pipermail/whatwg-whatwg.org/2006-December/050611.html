If you're implying, &quot;Treat as XML and if that fails....&quot;:

One of the cool things about Opera is that if it encounters a broken
xml document, you can reparse it as HTML with a click of a link.

That means, there could be an option for browsers that support
application/xhtml+xml to treat text/html as xml ( by sniffing for a
xmlns or some other way) and then either directly or non-directly fall
back to html if there's an error.

Firefox could do the same with the yellow bar that pops up at the top
of the page that says, &quot;The document appears to be XHTML, but is not
well formed. Firefox has reparsed it as HTML for you in an attempt to
handle the errors.&quot;, or something like that.

The problem with that would be that a lot of well-formed XHTML markup
would break if treated as XML ( because of casing rules etc.), so
you'd still want an option to reparse as HTML even if there were no
markup errors.

Sites could have a &quot;Our pages support 'text/html as XML'  handling.
Add us to your browsers's text/html -&gt; XML list.&quot;.

One point is that stuff like that could be done in a slick way with
the text/html type instead of a new type as we already have problems
with 2 types. (not that I believe this idea would be well accepted or
practical)

Just mentioning this though, I realize everyone's thinking, &quot;Users
would just turn that feature off and what's the point anyway etc.???&quot;,
but I do see some benefit in the idea as a developers tool, to spread
XHTML awareness and to provide XHTML benefits with just using
text/html.

To be on topic, the other point is, that describes a (far fetched) use
case for those suggesting  *partial* integration of XML stuff in
HTML5.
