OK. That's a pretty convincing argument, although it still leaves room for
the question what your suspicion is based on. Is a conscious effort being
made to define the HTML5 parse error spec such that it leaves as little room
as possible for such a hack?

Maybe. But with things like laws and specs you shouldn't only look at today's
situation. It takes years to define and then implement such things, so they
need to aim for usability in a not entirely foreseeable future. I name
Microsoft as today's obvious example, but no more than that. There will be
others. As long as a party can gain something it will try -- especially when
it stands a chance at succeeding. It is the limitability of that chance I'm
thinking about.

&gt;<i> I'm sure they realise
</I>&gt;<i> that such a move would only be detrimental to the web, not to mention
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, and not beneficial in any way.
</I>
Why wouldn't it be beneficial? When you control the market, you can ask any
price you like; you can operate in a much more comfortable stability then
when you're just one of many competitors.
