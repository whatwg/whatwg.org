{shrug} The same way they got them to use other such tools today. Frontpage,
Outlook, Explorer, Word, etc. all frustrate interoperability.

It doesn't require guns to get people to do most things. Much easier, cheaper
and effective to just make them feel good.

We'll have to see to what extend that will be put in practice. Anyway, as I
said, my point was not about Microsoft specifically (nor did I introduce the
mostly abused word &quot;evil&quot;), but 'parties that have the power to do such
things'. Microsoft is just the most obvious example of such a party today.

It wasn't too late for Microsoft when Netscape owned 95% of the market. It
wasn't too late for Google to take over the market when Alta Vista was the
main search engine.

&gt;<i> no sane developer would use a tool which

</I>
Have you looked at the Web lately? Whether it is due to insanity or not, the
reality is that some 95% of Web pages has accessiblity problems. *Many* Web
sites still genrate problems when accessed with Safari, Mozilla/Firefox,
Opera, iCab, lynx, IE pre-6, braille and speech browsers, mobile browsers,
spiders, etc. (Especially if you consider more than just HTML. Think of
things like javascript-dependancy, Flash-dependancy, WindowsMedia-depencency,
and even CSS-dependancy.)
