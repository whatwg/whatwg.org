OK, that ambition hadn't yet sunken in here.

Still, I don't see how this makes it not guesswork. Looks to me like a
*formalisation* of the guess work; specifying what is the best guess in
situation x. (Mind you, I'm not saying that is't useful, especially since
this guesswork is apparently based on research of real, out there in the
wild, HTM, and is this intelligent guesswork. But I don't see how, in error
situation x, interpreting y as z can ever guarantee that the author did
indeed mean z.)

Or do I misunderstand something?

</I>
Surely your &quot;not paying attention&quot; is the same as my earlier &quot;ignoring&quot;? How
does the ignorability of the lock icon make it negatively affect usability?
(Maybe from the standpoint of those who insist the user must deal with that
message, but surely not from the standpoint of the user.)

Sure, bugging people with error messages continuously is bad for usability.
But an unobtrusive, ignorable icon that conveys something useful?
