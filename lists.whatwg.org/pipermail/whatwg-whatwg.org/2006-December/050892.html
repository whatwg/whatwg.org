Your assumption seems to be that the interoperable handling of HTML 
documents is to somehow abort processing. This is not the case. Each error 
has explicitly defined error-recovery behaviour. The user need never know 
there was an error. The error-recovery behaviour described in HTML5 is as 
close to what IE does today as humanly possible.

</I>
No, no browser will say that. That's the way XML works, not how HTML 
works.
