I scetched two *general* groups, to keep things simple. Of course not
everybody will fit in either one. In fact most people will not fall in either
group most of the time ;)

The point was though, that there is a group who doesn't care or is even in
fact quite happy if the AWPS [automated web publishing system] fixes their
markup automagically.  The'y're not going to wet themselves just because
their 5 empty lines resulted in 1 empty line.

Others will indeed want more control (and will have to carry the
responsibiity that comes with that). I'm sure in this group you'll find
everything in a range from minor to major control. My point was that it would
be good if authoring systems would offer 'control modes' to accomodate those
different groups better.

Everybody's different, so there in the end there is no way to truly define
people in terms of groups. Not only that, many people will belong to a
different group in different situations. (One moment you're writing a CMS,
the other you're entering some some basic wiki syntax or markdown on a blog
or forum.)

I can't follow this. In what sense? Tidy is Tidy. AWPS authors can
incorporate it into their product. What standard or compatibility plays a
role here?

</I>&gt;<i> ESP engine spec?
</I>
The &quot;ESP engine&quot; is that part of the browser that guesses what authors might
have meant when the parser runs into crap posing as HTML.
