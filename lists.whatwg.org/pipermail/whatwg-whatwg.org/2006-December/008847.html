You guys are looking at the forests, not the trees. Don't nitpick the
details at this stage. It would be a PR campaign.  If they (Google, Yahoo,
MSN, et. al.) thought it were worth doing, they could damn well create a PR
campaign that would put the right spin on it.  Nice little happy logos for
complaint, poor little sad logos for non-compliant.  And they'd say it was a
public service aimed at making the web better, just like when the government
fixes potholes. The average user isn't so dumb that they can't understand
that some things are just for the benefit of the information super highway
even if they don't understand the details.

The only problem with what I just described is if there really is no value
in cleaning up websites that don't follow standards.  So that leaves just
one question...
