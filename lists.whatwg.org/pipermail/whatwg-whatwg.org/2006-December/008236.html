Yes I see. At the time I thought the spec required xml:lang to work  
in HTML, because of the way xml:lang is mentioned in the section  
about the lang attribute. Now I see it's the &quot;lang&quot; attribute in the  
&quot;xml&quot; namespace that would work, not the &quot;xml:lang&quot; attribute HTML  
would have.

But I think the reverse could work: xml:lang cannot work in HTML, but  
lang (html:lang) do work in XHTML if I'm not mistaken (although it's  
non-conforming).


&gt;&gt;<i> This would make it possible to have documents conformant with both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> syntaxes at the same time.

</I>
I don't want to send XHTML as text/html. I want to see if it's  
possible to have a common subset between HTML and XHTML at the markup  
level, so that someone can create a document that is conforming both  
with XHTML to HTML.

I'm not sure if this is desirable or not, that's why I was asking for  
opinions. I see that it may also be completely irrelevant, but I  
don't really know what to think.


&gt;&gt;<i> This could also help reinforce the idea that it's the media type that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differentiate HTML from XHTML. It'd make many valid XHTML1  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there conformant with HTML5 with a mere modification to the doctype.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not if they use things like &lt;![CDATA[...]]&gt; or the empty element  
</I>&gt;<i> syntax on
</I>&gt;<i> non-void elements, or any number of other XMLisms.
</I>
Well, by &quot;out there&quot; I meant all the XHTML1 documents that are built  
for text/html, that validates and which don't use any feature that  
both parser can handle. This certainly does not include &lt;![CDATA[...]]&gt;.

Sorry if I wasn't clear; &quot;out there&quot; was certainly misnomer.


&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it's a goal for the two serialisations to have a common
</I>&gt;<i> subset.
</I>
That's fine with me.
