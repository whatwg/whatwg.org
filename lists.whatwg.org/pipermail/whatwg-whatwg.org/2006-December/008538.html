How does this solution deal with, e.g. hAtom?

The content type does not help you there. Some other meta-information
is necessary.

&gt;&gt;<i> Fair enough. They still exist, though. Browser vendors aren't going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stop supporting this. We would be just sticking our heads in the sand if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we ignored this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many things are marked as &quot;deprecated&quot; in earlier HTML versions, and
</I>&gt;<i> are still supported by browsers.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, as the misuse of rel=&quot;alternate&quot; is not machine testable, and
</I>&gt;<i> given that I don't propose &quot;banning&quot; the use of rel=&quot;alternate&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> feed autodiscovery, I can't see how a browser vendor could &quot;stop
</I>&gt;<i> supporting this&quot;.
</I>
I agree that misusing &quot;alternate&quot; to link to feeds that are not an alternate
representation of the page should be non-conforming.

&gt;<i> Of course yes, and they will be discovered based on the content-type,
</I>&gt;<i> and rel=&quot;&quot; will deserve its real role: describing the relationship
</I>&gt;<i> between the two resources (and not describing the other end of the
</I>&gt;<i> link).
</I>
I agree that the &quot;feed&quot; link type is not /quite/ a proper link type--
it's more of a meta-content-type--but I've come to conclusion that the
problem it solves, and how neatly it solves it, eclipses this (subtle)
semantic distinction.

&gt;<i> Definition of feed: a bag of items; the representation of a feed
</I>&gt;<i> generally exposes only the 10, or so, latest created or updated items.
</I>&gt;<i> You'll note that this has nothing to do with the feed &quot;format&quot; (Atom,
</I>&gt;<i> RSS, a Web log's homepage in HTML, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> If a document was once linked from a feed's representation as an item,
</I>&gt;<i> it is an item of this feed, even if the feed's current representation
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't link to it anymore. The relationship still exists. This
</I>&gt;<i> relationship is &quot;I am an item of this feed&quot; or &quot;this is a feed within
</I>&gt;<i> which I once appeared&quot;. I propose representing it as rel=&quot;feed&quot;.
</I>...
&gt;<i> Anyway, if you link to something, there's a reason. This reason is
</I>&gt;<i> that there is a relationship between the current document and the
</I>&gt;<i> thing the link points to. This relationship is described in the rel=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It is *a* feed&quot; is not a valid reason, it doesn't describe a relationship.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This is an alternate representation of this page in a format you can
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe to&quot; is a valid reason: it's an alternate representation.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I am an item of this feed&quot; is a valid reason: I was once linked from
</I>&gt;<i> it, so you'll find other similar things you might be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> (because they are from the same author, or about the same subject,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. this is to be &quot;explained&quot; to the user using the title=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, that's not something a &quot;machine&quot; has to know about).
</I>
That's an interesting relationship. Perhaps it could be expressed as
&quot;index feed&quot; within the context of WA1.0's current link type definitions.
In any case, I would like to see this use case definitively addressed.
Such a link would be the most appropriate default feed to subscribe to
from an entry page, if it were somehow clearly labelled.
