<PRE>
I've been having a lot of trouble following this discussion, because I 
can't work out what it is that is being asked for. There seem to be 
multiple discussions going on, and it isn't clear to me that everybody 
really knows what they are arguing for or against.

I've changed the spec to allow a (meaningless) &quot;xmlns&quot; attribute on the 
root &lt;html&gt; element, for the same reasons /&gt; is allowed on void elements 
now. I don't think it's a particularly useful thing, but I'm curious to 
see what people think. (Like anything in the spec, we might remove it in 
due course, based on real world experiences with the spec.)

There seem to be other issues being raised, though. Here's some possible 
things I think people might be asking for, based on the thread so far and 
on discussions on IRC:

Possible Request A: We want a way to add proprietary markup to HTML 
documents, and have them be usable by text/html browsers.

Possible Request B: We want a way to add markup representing standard 
vocabularies other than HTML (e.g. MathML, SVG, DocBook, RDF) to HTML 
documents, and have them be usable by text/html browsers.

Possible Request C: We want XML-style draconian error handling for 
text/html.

Possible Request D: We want HTML-style graceful error handling for XML 
content sent.

Possible Request E: We want to use XML syntactic sugar in HTML.

Possible Request F: We want a powerful tool chain like the XML one.

Are there other requests? What are they?

Let's address each of the above in turn:


* Possible Request A: We want a way to add proprietary markup to HTML 
documents, and have them be usable by text/html browsers.

This won't work, because the browsers won't support that proprietary 
markup. This has nothing to do with the specs. (The same problem exists in 
XML.) For the same reason, proprietary markup is poor for accessibility. 
HTML actually has a mechanism to add custom/proprietary semantics to 
general HTML semantics, which works hand-in-hand with good accessibility 
techniques and _does_ work in existing browsers, namely the &quot;class&quot;, 
&quot;rel&quot;, and (for now) &quot;profile&quot; attributes. This is how microformats.org 
work. This doesn't require any sort of XML markup.


* Possible Request B: We want a way to add markup representing standard 
vocabularies other than HTML (e.g. MathML, SVG, DocBook, RDF) to HTML 
documents, and have them be usable by text/html browsers.

These should be raised as distinct feature requests. We're already looking 
at adding Math markup to HTML (probably in a way compatible with MathML 
renderer implementations). SVG is not semantically rich (it's 
presentational), and so probably belongs not in the document layer (HTML) 
but in the presentation layer (CSS+XBL) or the embedding layer (external 
documents using &lt;object&gt; and fallback content for accessibility).


* Possible Request C: We want XML-style draconian error handling for 
text/html.

This won't work, because of the existence of legacy text/html content 
that would trigger error messages. (Browsers with draconian text/html 
handling wouldn't even get any market share.)


* Possible Request D: We want HTML-style graceful error handling for XML 
content.

This is out of scope of the HTML5 specification. Speak to the XML guys. 
XML currently requires draconian error handling and has no defined 
gracefull error handling.

You should ask yourself, though, why is it that you want to use XML, if 
you don't like what it implies?


* Possible Request E: We want to use XML syntactic sugar in HTML.

This wouldn't work, because new syntactic sugar in HTML would have to be 
compatible with legacy content and legacy browsers. The XML syntactic 
sugar (like &lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;) doesn't really work well in HTML (what with it 
becoming a comment and all). Some things -- xmlns=&quot;&quot;, /&gt;, &apos; -- are 
already allowed in HTML5. We could theoretically add PIs as well, I guess. 
I don't see what else we could add. (And PIs are a bad idea in both XML 
and HTML anyway, except for stylesheets, where for backwards compatibility 
reasons we have to rely on &lt;link&gt; in HTML anyway.)


* Possible Request F: We want a powerful tool chain like the XML one.

By introducing HTML5 parsers and serialisers that plug onto the ends of 
existing XML toolchains, we can leverage the XML tool chain without having 
to force authors to use XML. Work is already in progress to enable this. 
The parser specification (new in HTML5) enables this. The lack of such a 
spec for previous versions of HTML is, IMHO, the reason why there has 
never been a strong HTML tool chain.

HTML is actually pretty rich, all things considered. SVG, on the other

What I'm &quot;hostile&quot; towards is the fiction that you can take an XML parser 
and attempt to parse an HTML document. The two formats aren't the same, 
using the wrong parser is simply that, wrong.

Exactly. And the *exact same situation* exists today with XML.

Anyone who actually ties to use an XML parser to handle HTML rapidly hits 
a wall, since most HTML documents are not even close to actually 
conformant to the HTML or XML specs. Even if we were to require that HTML5 
documents use exactly XML syntax, this would still be the case.

A browser that shipped with a frowy face showing on 93% of pages would do

You can do that with HTML5 too. (Or HTML4, in theory.)

Making it conformant HTML5 is even easier than making it conformant XML 
(and you don't even need to make it syntactically correct to get 
interoperable behaviour, with HTML5, since the parser has defined error 
handling behaviour).

What is it about XML that you like, that you don't get with HTML, that 
makes you request that we make HTML more like XML?

</I>
In the Web Apps 1.0 world, an HTTP message whose headers say text/html is 
an HTML document, regardless of what sequence of bytes the body of the 
message actually say. An HTTP message whose headers say text/xml, or use 
some other XML MIME type, is an XML document. It's the MIME type that 
decides how it is processed. If it is processed as an HTML document, then 
it _is_ an HTML document, possibly with errors. So says the spec.

Browsers wouldn't implement this due to performance concerns (it was 
considered for XHTML-as-text/html back in the day). It also would result 
in dramatically different renderings, just because there was a minor 
well-formedness error one day.

I have huge doubts that this would pass even elementary usability testing,

The above is being considered. It doesn't necessarily require any XML,

Requiring xml:lang seems like a bad idea (since it's longer for no good

three different language attributes with weird fallback rules, which would 
end up being a huge source of bugs and an implementation nightmare. 
Browsers have enough trouble implementing this stuff without having to 
give them incomprehensible namespace confusion like this.

Well, it's impossible. If you _think_ you're using XHTML, but you process 
it with an HTML processor (e.g. by sending it as text/html), then you're 
really just using HTML, with a lot of syntax errors.

HTML5 isn't based on SGML, so no. You have to write your own parser, or 
use one of the HTML5 parsers being written as we speak.

This is basically correct, yes. (It's possible if you're an advanced

text/html. Which means using HTML, not XHTML, because text/html content

Just out of interest, could you say what those are? It's likely that HTML5 
actually has the same benefits, so that you don't lose them by using HTML5 
instead of XHTML5.


The following e-mail very clearly describes the problem, I think:

pipeline with an HTML5 serialiser on the end. (This would basically mean 
dropping the HTML4 code, simplifying the CMS, and making very few changes 
to the XML serialiser.)


&gt;<i> 7.) Currently offering a CMS/web app generates XHTML with an XML pipeline
</I>
Move to HTML5 with an XML pipeline. (This is basically the same as number 
6, except that there's no code to drop first.)

It will be split in due course, but not while it's actively developed, as 
that would be a significant increase in development cost.

I'm not sure this would be compatible enough, but it's one of the things

Adding MathML or SVG to HTML doesn't require using XML, necessarily. But 
we're looking at that. (Mainly we need implementation experience to be 
able to make educated design choices here.)

JavaScript is a more apt example, since it's used on the Web... and it has

I'd be interested in seeing statistics on this.

Actually, all those _are_ hand authored. They all use templates that were 
very carefully written by HTML authors by hand.

</I>
Again, most of the HTML on those pages was hand-authored. Sure, it was 
written in Perl scripts (or whatnot), but it was still, at one point, 
hand-authored, and not generated by a markup editor like Dreamweaver.



&gt;<i> Hand authoring is a distinct minority on the web today.

I would need statistics to be convinced of this. My own research doesn't 
back this up.

I think this is a false dichtomy. I think there is a FAR bigger set, 
namely those who do not have the level of skill necessary to hand author 
HTML in a text editor, but do so anyway.

Given that we're talking about HTML here, I don't see what you mean (since 
for you, as you've told me, &quot;well-formed&quot; means XML).

Why do you need well-formedness? Is it to ensure interoperability? HTML5 
ensure interoperability even in the absense of syntactic correctness, by 
defining clear error handling rules. Is this not enough? Why not?

It would be better to have hard data to work with, rather than having to 
rely on our opinions of this. My own research does not suggest that most 
authors use tools. That over three quarters of pages have major syntactic 
errors leads me to suspect that tools are not going to save the syntax.

This would break millions of pages, sadly. There are huge volumes of pages 
that have bogus xmlns=&quot;&quot; attributes with all kinds of bogus values on the 
Web today. I worked for a browser vendor in the past few years that tried 
to implement xmlns=&quot;&quot; in text/html content, and found that huge amounts of 
the Web, including many major sites, broke completely. We can't introduce 
live xmlns=&quot;&quot; attributes to text/html.

That doesn't mean we can't introduce MathML, SVG, or other language 
vocabularies to HTML5 in other ways, though, and this is being examined.

Currently, there wouldn't be one. We could extend HTML5 to have some sort 
of way of doing this, in the future. (It isn't clear to me that we'd want 
to allow inline SVG, though. It's an external embedded resource, not a 
semantically-rich part of the document, IMHO.)

Mostly because they have almost as much in common with XML as HTML5 does.
