<PRE>
Thanks for your patience trying to work out these extremely hypothetical
examples with me. I need to figure out a way to get the internal
examples out here so we can discuss them concretely. In the meantime,
you have motivated me to look at the existing infrastructure with a
different perspective and try to see how we can solve our problems
without adding new attributes.

One of the key problems I'm trying to solve is to have a single parser
for all HTML files. I'll keep the list posted on my progress on that and
come back when I have more information on the rest.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what you mean by &quot;existential&quot; in this paragraph.

</I>&gt;<i> If you are saying &quot;how do we make the pard-id be a property of the order

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;div id=&quot;order1&quot; class=&quot;ibm-order&quot;&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Microformats is very restrictive in how you can parse the data.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't understand why you think this. Could you elaborate?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess restrictive is the wrong word, it's only defined to say you must 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grab the entire HTML content within the element. Fair enough again. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although, I'd like to differentiate between HTML sub-content, plain text 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and also specify which data type. quantity is an integer/long/etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you can define your structure pretty much as you like, nothing 
</I>&gt;<i> forces you to define &quot;description&quot; in the example above as being the 
</I>&gt;<i> entire contents, you could just as easily say that your processing model 
</I>&gt;<i> only involves the direct child text nodes, or some such.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We need the flexibility of specify the content everywhere, yet the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> property apply to any element on the page, not just the parent 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> element.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Again, concrete examples would really help me understand this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In some part of the page....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;div id=&quot;picture1&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img src=&quot;picture1.jpg&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now somewhere else in the page....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;span about=&quot;picture1&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;&gt;A Night in Venice&lt;/span&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here I'm able to connect two elements in the page. I'm not sure how I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would use id to differentiate the two.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why would you need this? Just have:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;figure&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;img src=&quot;picture1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;legend&gt; A night in Venice &lt;/legend&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/figure&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you could provide a URI to a document showing why you need the legend 
</I>&gt;<i> and the figure split from each other, that would be very useful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't emphasise enough that it would really help if you could point to 
</I>&gt;<i> some real world examples (with URIs) showing what we are talking about. 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, as I've mentioned before, it feels very hypothetical.
