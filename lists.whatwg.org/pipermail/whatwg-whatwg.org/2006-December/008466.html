In one of the products, we need two things: one to specify our own piece
of structure data (call it microformat, call it RDFa data). Our first
problem is parsing microformats. We must somehow explain in prose how to
parse our specific microformats just like hCard/hEvent do or do it via
GRDDL (XSLT transform) or custom JavaScript parsing code. If you can
read in the uF wiki [1] there's really not much guidance on how to parse
one or all of them. RDFa on the other hand gives a generic parsing
mechanism to extract properties (hopefully as a JSON object) for our
value-added JS libraries to enhance the UI of our applications.
Secondly, we need our customers to safely express details about objects
also via HTML using a metadata approach that allows this, currently
RDFa, without worrying about class names collisions. I guess in a
nutshell what has attracted the attention of several of our developers
is the ability to have a single parser (as RDFa defines such mechanism)
to extract JSON/RDF representations of structured data in the HTML. The
goal ultimately is to have those object specified by customers grafted
into other UIs in our systems in an extensible manner.

I hope this gets a bit more concrete, but as I check around tomorrow at
work, I'll try to get more details. Thanks.
