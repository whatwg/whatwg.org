Yup, that's always been a problem. However, it might be harder for them 
than you might imagine. For example, the parser spec in HTML5 is basically 
the most compatible you can be with IE7's parser as humanly possible, 
because we need to be able to render existing content. But Microsoft also 
have to be compatible with IE7's parser, since they _also_ have to be 
compatible with existing content. So they effectively have to be pretty 
compatible with HTML5.


&gt;<i> So my question is: am I wrong that this risk exists? And if the risk 
</I>&gt;<i> exists, what are the plans to deal with that situation when it happens?
</I>
The plan has always been to provide shims to make HTML5 work in the most 
popular browser, thus allowing content to exist that relies on HTML5, thus 
encouraging browser vendors to support it natively.
