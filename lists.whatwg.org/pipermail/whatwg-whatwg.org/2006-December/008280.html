OK, so how many of those sites produce well formed code? If the tools 
will save us all, why hasn't it happened yet? As I said, tool authors 
prioritize their budget for things other than well-formnedness of the 
output - things that will actually benefit the tool users and site 
customers. Moreover, XML is an entirely unacceptable risk for any 
business - it's too easy to accidentally transmit malformed data and 
knock the site out. Why do that when you have the option of using a UA 
mode that supports error recovery?

I'm totally lost about your point. You seem to have changed from saying 
&quot;producing valid XML is easy - any non-bozo can do it&quot; to &quot;well it's not 
easy but the tools will save us all&quot;.
