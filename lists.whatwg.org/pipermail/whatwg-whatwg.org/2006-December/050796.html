You are aware that I like to &quot;tweak&quot; IE users, right?

With the current technology, this could have been avoided with a single 
div and two lines of CSS.  And I am most capable of doing that.

In the longer run, I do believe that an architected simple rule like:

    xmlns attributes are invalid on HTML elements except html, and
    when found on unrecognized attributes imply style=&quot;display:none&quot;
    unless you recognize the value of this attribute.

... would channel those with insane desires to make extensions into 
doing so in a manner that is harmless.  Such a rule might take a year or 
two to get widely deployed, but the worst feet-draggers won't be 
affected any worse than they were in the days when &lt;table&gt; was young.
