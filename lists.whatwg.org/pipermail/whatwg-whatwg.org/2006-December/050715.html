Well, if you want to call &quot;well-defined interoperable error handling&quot; 
&quot;guesswork&quot;, then sure. I guess that's just terminology.

The point is the browsers all do the same thing, and that's well-defined 
and documented.


&gt;<i> I don't see how, in error situation x, interpreting y as z can ever 
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee that the author did indeed mean z.
</I>
Well, if all the browsers do Z, then since the author presumably checked 
his page with at least one browser, and it did Z, and he didn't correct Y, 
then the assumption that Z is what Y was supposed to be is IMHO a safe 
one.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; How is that different from that key in the status bar that they see 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; randomly on some pages?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given the extremely bad usability of SSL UI, and the fact that the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, bugging people with error messages continuously is bad for

</I>
This is somewhat out of scope of the WHATWG work. In my experience with 
usability studies, unobtrusive, ignorable icons are a waste of time, and 
in my experience with browser vendors, they mostly try to avoid UI that's 
a waste of time. I doubt a mainstream browser would support this feature.

It's certainly possible, though, and the HTML5 spec goes to some lengths 
to make implementing such a feature somewhat easier than it had been, for 
example by defining what is a parse error and what is not.
