OK, agreed. For HTML5 documents that seems a reasonable assumption. (Assuming
the browser indeed is HTML5 compliant.)

I'm still somewhat sceptical about the reality of this though, as it relies
on the author checking the document with at least one HTML5-compliant
browser. This reliance would provide Microsoft an easy attack vector on
HTML5: give away free authoring tools (or even lure people into paying for
them) that produce code that triggers HTML5-compliant browsers to, as per the
HTML5 spec, stop processing the document, and have InternetExplorer present
such documents as if they're fine.

What then? Will every other browser really tell the user that it won't try to
interpret what the author might have meant?
