An HTML parser relies on knowledge of the schema, so it's not easy to 
parse an arbitrary, unknown schema with an HTML parser.

For example, HTML offers no syntactic way to differentiate between 
&quot;void&quot; elements like &lt;br&gt; and normal elements like &lt;div&gt;. The parser 
just &quot;knows&quot; that BR is void.

Likewise, the content model of the &lt;script&gt; element is &quot;hardcoded&quot; into 
the parser; there's no way to discover it from the syntax alone. (I'll 
admit that there's no similar construct to the content model of &lt;script&gt; 
in XML, however, so this particular difference doesn't pose a problem.)

In order to handle custom elements in HTML while still allowing them to 
appear in the DOM, you'd have to make some rules such as that no void 
elements are allowed. You'd have to write otherwise-void elements as, 
say, &lt;img&gt;&lt;/img&gt; in order to have them handled correctly by the parser.

Even if you aren't constructing a DOM of these unknown elements, you 
need to be able to count opens and closes so that you can detect the end 
of the root custom element and resume normal parsing.

 &gt; Standard browsers would be advised to ignore extensions that they
 &gt; don't understand.  Including any text, so we don't have a repeat of
 &gt; the &lt;table&gt; problem again.

I'm sure you realise this, but there are already browsers out there that 
*don't* ignore extensions that they don't understand, so a mandate such 
as this would be meaningless.
