This exactly summarises why we can't do this.

I don't really see how this would be particularly beneficial. Saving two 
characters to specify an ID (and 5 for a class) at the cost of losing 
compatibility with all legacy UAs, seems pointless.

Exactly.

Yes... that's why we're not inventing anything unless we absolutely have 
to. Like &lt;canvas&gt;, or &lt;datagrid&gt;, or the various other new features in 
HTML5. (There aren't that many. They're all pretty vital.)


&gt;<i> In other words: what is so conceptually wrong with HTML 4.01 that

</I>
HTML5 is HTML4, just better defined (fixing bugs in HTML4) and with a few 
new features to handle things HTML4 couldn't do.


Please let me know if there is something that was said in this thread that 
deserves further reply; I don't think there was (mostly this thread was 
people disagreeing with Andrew or off-topic discussion).

Cheers,
