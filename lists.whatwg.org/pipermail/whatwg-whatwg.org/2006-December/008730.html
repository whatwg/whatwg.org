Yes; I think a rigorous process is important. Don't you? Designing formats 
ad hoc is hardly good design practice.


&gt;<i> So is the better approach to wait until the issue has created real 
</I>&gt;<i> non-reversable problems and the web is even more Balkanized?
</I>
Yes. That's how technologies evolve and are designed. You let the market 
show you what is needed, then you address it. Addressing problems before 
they exist is a form of premature optimisation and is not a good way to 
design technologies.


&gt;<i> Can you say XHTML and text/html? (I thought you could.)
</I>
XHTML isn't an example of this. HTML itself is an example of this -- 
people needed calendar widgets, people made up massive hacks of JS 
libraries to get them, and eventually HTML added a calendar widget.

XHTML, if anything, is an example of the premature optimisation I 
mentioned. People didn't _need_ an XML version of HTML, but it was 
provided anyway, solving a non-existant (and poorly specified) problem. 
Result: a mess, with XHTML not even remotely addressing real needs.


&gt;<i> -- Anywhere else people want to create &quot;add-hoc&quot; microformats using 
</I>&gt;<i> keyword values in class/profile attributes say they SHOULD use the 
</I>&gt;<i> format of &quot;xxxx-yyyy&quot; where &quot;xxxx&quot; is an ad-hoc context/namespace and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;yyyy&quot; is the specific semantic markup, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&lt;span profile=&quot;webspec-editor&quot;&gt;Ian Hickson&lt;/span&gt;
</I>
Realistically, most authors wouldn't follow such a requirement.


&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, this would have a small footprint in the spec. It 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be REQUIRED, and it wouldn't even need to be parsed by the HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> parser. However, it would provide a disambiguation mechanism that 
</I>&gt;<i> frankly I think would solve a huge future problem that will otherwise 
</I>&gt;<i> occur.
</I>
Nobody is going to stop you from using disambiguating prefixes if you want 
to use them; in the documents you need to worry about, and in the formats 
you want to work with, I encourage you to use them.


&gt;<i> P.S. Already RDFa vcard conflicts with Microformat vcard.  Why not stop 
</I>&gt;<i> the madness before it really starts?
</I>
RDFa isn't going to conflict with anything in the real world.
