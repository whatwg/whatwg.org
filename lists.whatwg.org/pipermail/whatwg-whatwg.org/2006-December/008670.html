Can I ask some really basic questions about this? (Jason Hunter's talk
didn't appear to be online.) Are there Exist equivalents for Python,
PHP, and Ruby programmers, or do we all need to use Java in the brave
new world?

Is the theory here that the entire site's content goes into one XML
file? And, if so, what happens when it gets big? Or would you have
different XML files for each article, comment, and user? What happens to
hypermedia like videos, images, and audio? Is there a walkthrough of
creating a hypermedia system with Exist online? (A brief search of the
Exist website didn't turn one up, although I see it includes a module
for resizing images.) Are such systems going to be as simple for
end-users to install on their servers as WordPress?

To which Rimantas Liubertas replied:
&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> such system, which will be pretty compelling reason to stick with
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;old-fashioned&quot; RDBMs which &quot;just work&quot;.
</I>
I really can't see how this follows from what Elliotte was saying. Is
John Doe a programmer or an end-user? Plenty of programmers seem to have
difficulties with databases of all stripes. And I can't see why the
end-user would be worrying about well-formedness with such a CMS any
more than they worry about well-formedness when using OpenOffice.org or
Microsoft Word.
