In case there is anybody here who doesn't faithfully follow my blog 
&lt;grin&gt;, I have prototyped MathML + SVG + XLINK in HTML4:

This lead Jacques Distler to modify his MovableType plugin:

I figure that if the existing FireFox HTML4 parser has an existing test 
suite then modifying the parser to obviate the need for the script is 
likely only a weekend task.  This could be designed in such a way that 
it was only enabled as an about:config option.  Where I would need help 
with is in getting it into the codebase.  (Robert?  You listening?)
