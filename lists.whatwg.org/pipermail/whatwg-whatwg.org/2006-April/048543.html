So, like, the address in the following HTML:

   &lt;button onclick=&quot;
     navigater.registerContentHandler('<A HREF="http://www.example.com/&amp;eacute;">http://www.example.com/&eacute;</A>', ...);
   &quot;/&gt;

...would be invalid? Or not? That changed when the IRI spec came out. I'm 
not sure you can guarentee that a URI will always be invalid.


&gt;<i> Anyway, I wonder if it's worth mentioning that malformed URIs should 
</I>&gt;<i> never cause an exception to be thrown? (other than lack of %s of course)
</I>
Added.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; BTW... shouldn't sites have the possibility to unregister 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; themselves? I as a user would expect a site that has a &quot;register me&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; button to also have an &quot;unregister me&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would presume the UA would provide this option, not the page. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Similarly, you don't have a Web API to remove a search engine, only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to add one.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, the UA should have that as well. But it feels to me that the page 
</I>&gt;<i> should also have it. This API is more likely than the search engine case 
</I>&gt;<i> to register pages that require having an account (e.g. subscribe to a 
</I>&gt;<i> feed, import a .ics file, send an email (mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">foo at bar</A>)). Wouldn't it 
</I>&gt;<i> be nice if the page could unregister itself when the user deletes their 
</I>&gt;<i> account?
</I>
I don't know, would it? I don't see the use case. Why would, e.g., Flickr, 
ever unregister itself as an image/x-flickr handler? (The only theoretical 
case I can see, namely the site changing its server location, seems like a 
bad reason -- you should always support the old location, good URIs don't 
change.)


&gt;<i> Hm... actually it's possible that we have differing ideas of how the UI 
</I>&gt;<i> will look. I am imagining that there will be an option for the user to 
</I>&gt;<i> always open that protocol/content type with the specified URL. If this 
</I>&gt;<i> is done during registration, where would you as a user expect to 
</I>&gt;<i> unregister the URL again? Where you registered it, I would say.
</I>
I think that would be a very dangerous option. But in any case, consider 
the case for a download today -- you can set the default to always be a 
particular app when you download a file, so how do you change the default? 
IMHO it would be in the same place.


&gt;<i> But, I don't feel strongly on this point. If this doesn't convince you, 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm fine with that :)
</I>
I think we should wait until we have more experience before adding the 
unregister feature. Adding features is reasonably easy. Removing them is 
near-impossible.


&gt;<i> I do suspect that this will lead to inconsistent UI. Some files will go 
</I>&gt;<i> to the registered URL, some to the pre-existing handler (local app or 
</I>&gt;<i> something). The user may have no idea why.
</I>
The same could be said today for clicking on a link. I'm all for making 
this better, but I don't see what the spec can do to help.


&gt;<i> &gt; This seems equivalent to what is currently in the spec -- the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already says that when the UA uses the given URI, it must do so in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular way. I've added some minor text to reference that more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explicitly in the paragraph you mention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To me, &quot;User agents may do whatever they like&quot; means that there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions. It sounds to me like they can ignore everything that was 
</I>&gt;<i> said before. I guess leave this as-is if you don't think people will 
</I>&gt;<i> read it that way.
</I>
Clearly people will, if you did. :-)

I've changed it to:

   User agents may, within the constraints described in this
   seciton, do whatever they like [...]


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - The request may have required certain cookies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - The request may have required certain authentication headers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - The request may only be possible from certain IP ranges
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In other words, the content might be privileged -- in which case you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definitely don't want to send it to a remote site!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, you may still want to send it to a remote site. Consider this: A 
</I>&gt;<i> university's information system may allow exporting a student's courses 
</I>&gt;<i> for a semester as an ICS file. A user may well not mind sending that ics 
</I>&gt;<i> file to Google Calendar, but accessing that export functionality does 
</I>&gt;<i> require authentication of course.
</I>
I think for this case the university should either offer a &quot;private&quot; URI 
that can be forwarded to the remote site (much like how Google Calendar 
has a &quot;private URI&quot; for your ICS file), or the user should download the 
file, go to the other site, and upload it.


&gt;<i> &gt; Leaking intranet URIs is a lot less dangerous than leaking intranet 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _content_, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah. That's true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it doesn't require anything. The spec doesn't say when you use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this --
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Convenient, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in particular, it doesn't say you should use these options for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; result of non-GET or authenticated requests. It even says that maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you _shouldn't_ use it for authenticated requests, and I've now added 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a sentence that says you musn't use it for non-GET resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I fear this will lead to inconsistent UI. That you don't say when 
</I>&gt;<i> it should be used is also not ideal, but I guess unavoidable as you 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to require a certain UI.
</I>
I don't see how we can require a certain UI. User Interface is how 
browsers differentiate from each other.


&gt;<i> Let me ask you: Does a spec with this many unspecified details satisfy 
</I>&gt;<i> you?
</I>
Yes, I wouldn't have written it otherwise. :-) This is not a UI spec -- 
this is a spec that is to ensure one thing and one thing only, namely that 
the same basic feature can be offered for any browser without having to 
browser-sniff.

Specs don't say how, e.g., &lt;select&gt; elements should work, other than the 
fact that they should offer certain options. Whether it's control-click or 
command-click or whether it's a drop down or a list or whether it's a 
pop-up, is all up to the UA. You can't require a particular UI, because 
some applications (e.g. EmacsSpeak) have radically different UIs than 
others (e.g. Opera on a cell phone).


&gt;<i> &gt; The main use cases I see here are for feeds, and for those you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definitely want to send the URI. Same with, e.g., an iCalendar feed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe. The iCalendar file in question may not be something that changes 
</I>&gt;<i> though. It seems to me like this is useful only for very few use cases, 
</I>&gt;<i> limited basically to feeds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not happy with registerContentHandler at all.
</I>
I'm not sure how to address your issues. What text would you like to see 
be added to the spec?
