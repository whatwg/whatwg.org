</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hm, I'm not sure what you mean -- we have no way of holding on to a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for most, I would think.  Adding support for retained path objects would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be an additional chunk of work, though, and isn't really necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was suggesting that we may wish to add that code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider a &lt;canvas&gt; implementation of a board game with many little

</I>&gt;<i> With the API above, you basically have to redraw the entire board, except
</I>&gt;<i> instead of calling .fill() on each one, you call .pointInPathFill(). That
</I>&gt;<i> seems painful. Then again, you have the same problem with .fill() in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place, so maybe it's not a big deal.
</I>
I don't think it's a big deal either; creating the path itself is
typically not the expensive part of those operations, and not having a
retained-path mode simplifies the API.  There are things we can borrow
from OpenGL that can help here if we want a more complex picking API;
specifically, you would enable a special picking mode, and then before
drawing any object (as complex as you want), you would assign it a
tag.  You end up building up a scene with regions &quot;filled&quot; with these
tags; then you submit x,y queries and you get back what tag is at the
given coordinate.

Note that with getPixel(s) you can do basically that right now -- use
an offscreen canvas, draw each pick-shape in a different color, and do
picking queries against that offscreen canvas.  Would be quite fast,
especially if your base scene that you want to pick to doesn't change
all that often.

&gt;<i> (Incidentally, I would prefer isPointInPathFill() or isPointInPath() for
</I>&gt;<i> this method name, since it is a test that returns a boolean.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming nobody has any problem with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    boolean isPointInPath(in float x, in float y);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...then I'll add that to the spec when you reply to this mail.
</I>
Sure, isPointInPath sounds fine.  We can always add
isPointInStrokedPath if we ever want to bother with that (which is
where the &quot;...Fill&quot; bit came from in my API, because the region
covered by a stroked path and that covered by a filled path are
different, even though testing for a hit against a filled region would
by far be the common case).

&gt;<i> Incidentally, what JS type did you mean float[] to map to? A simply Array
</I>&gt;<i> instance?
</I>
Yeah; there's some JS2 stuff that might help optimize this in the
future, but a simple Array for now.
