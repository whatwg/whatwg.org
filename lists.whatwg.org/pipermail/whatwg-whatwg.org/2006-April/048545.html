I see your point, and it makes sense. What I meant, kind of, was whether 
a failure calling nsIIOService::newURI, in Mozilla code, should cause an 
exception to be thrown here, but that is clearly not wording the spec 
can use :-)

But the solution you picked is fine.

Thanks.

Mmm, good point. OK.

&gt;&gt;<i> I do suspect that this will lead to inconsistent UI. Some files will go

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something). The user may have no idea why.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same could be said today for clicking on a link. I'm all for making

</I>
No, I disagree (about the &quot;today&quot; part). When you click the link, and it 
links to a certain MIME type, you are always able to open that in your 
preferred application, no?

&gt;<i> Clearly people will, if you did. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've changed it to:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    User agents may, within the constraints described in this
</I>&gt;<i>    seciton, do whatever they like [...]
</I>
Thank you, that sounds much better (except for the typo :) but that 
seems to be in the email only, not in the spec).

&gt;<i> I think for this case the university should either offer a &quot;private&quot; URI 
</I>&gt;<i> that can be forwarded to the remote site (much like how Google Calendar 
</I>&gt;<i> has a &quot;private URI&quot; for your ICS file), or the user should download the 
</I>&gt;<i> file, go to the other site, and upload it.
</I>
Hmm... maybe... this requires special action on all sites that provide 
content of this type though.

&gt;<i> I don't see how we can require a certain UI. User Interface is how 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers differentiate from each other.
</I>
Yeah, indeed.

&gt;&gt;<i> Let me ask you: Does a spec with this many unspecified details satisfy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I wouldn't have written it otherwise. :-)
</I>
:<i>)
</I>
&gt;<i> This is not a UI spec -- 
</I>&gt;<i> this is a spec that is to ensure one thing and one thing only, namely that 
</I>&gt;<i> the same basic feature can be offered for any browser without having to 
</I>&gt;<i> browser-sniff.
</I>
I'm not even sure you can avoid that. If a page doesn't like how a 
particular browser filled in the holes of the spec, it may well want to 
avoid offering this feature to it. (All hypothetical, I know... but 
there's just no browser that implements this yet or a page that uses it yet)

&gt;<i> Specs don't say how, e.g., &lt;select&gt; elements should work, other than the 
</I>&gt;<i> fact that they should offer certain options. Whether it's control-click or 
</I>&gt;<i> command-click or whether it's a drop down or a list or whether it's a 
</I>&gt;<i> pop-up, is all up to the UA. You can't require a particular UI, because 
</I>&gt;<i> some applications (e.g. EmacsSpeak) have radically different UIs than 
</I>&gt;<i> others (e.g. Opera on a cell phone).
</I>
Sure. I didn't mean that you should suggest a particular UI, although it 
may have sounded like I did. But, because it can't specify the UI, the 
spec leaves out important information IMO.

Now... maybe if you look at it like &quot;Pages can tell the UA that they can 
handle a type&quot; instead of &quot;Page wants to handle all content of a certain 
type, or at least know what it can't handle&quot; it's not so bad... But does 
this suffice for pages? I have no idea.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not happy with registerContentHandler at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how to address your issues. What text would you like to see 
</I>&gt;<i> be added to the spec?
</I>
Well. What I would _like_ is not something you will like, I suspect... 
What I would like is the specification of registerContentHandler to be 
removed.
