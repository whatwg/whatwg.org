The spec says:
&quot;User agents are not free to handle non-conformant documents as they  
please; the processing model described in this specification applies  
to implementations regardless of the conformity of the input documents.&quot;

I think this view of conformance is too restricted. Considering the  
availability of XML tools and how easy it would be to handle  
*conforming* HTML5 documents with those tools as well, I think the  
cost of supporting the processing model for HTML5 makes no sense  
considering the benefit in many (or most) non-browser scenarios.

Consider a non-browser UA that does not do scripting and is a  
conforming XHTML5 UA and is built on off-the-shelf XML tools. It  
would be nice for such an app to be able to ingest HTML5.

Dealing with conforming HTML5 documents would be simple: Just convert  
them into equivalent conforming XHTML5 documents and send them down  
the XML code path. If the UA does not run scripts delivered in  
content, this kind of conversion is pretty harmless. Even if the UA  
is a special-purpose CSS formatter, changes are that requiring the  
style sheets to be authored for XHTML is acceptable.

The benefits of hooking a TagSoup-like parser into the UA would be  
huge compared to the little work required to glue the additional off- 
the-shelf parser in.

But what about non-conforming HTML5 docs? On the XHTML5 side, ill- 
formed docs would be rejected outright. On the HTML5 side, however,  
the spec requires an elaborate error-handling model that leaks to the  
internals of the app and does not stay at the parser level. This has  
adverse effects:
  * Leaking to the app internals means that the off-the-shelf XML  
tools would perhaps need patching. XML 1.0 places rather arbitrary  
(but mandatory) restrictions eg. on attribute names. Having to pass  
on names that do not conform would potentially violate every  
documented XML-based API contract throughout the app (much like the  
infamous XML 1.1...).
  * The way the adoption agency algorithm requires changes to parts  
of the doc that have already been passed to the app would prevent the  
use of streaming XML APIs or would require full-DOM buffering first  
defeating the performance benefits of streaming APIs. Full-DOM  
buffering would be unwise in e.g. a high-throughput spider. :-)
  * Implementing the HTML5 processing model incurs a tremendous  
opportunity cost, because whoever has to do it could instead hook up  
a TagSoup-like parser and then work on new features.
  * If whoever has to implement it does it for money, there will be a  
significant accounting cost.
  * The adverse effects on software architecture will incur costs, too.

I think the model of processing HTML with XML tools is just too  
useful to be abandoned just because the spec requires a particular  
browser-oriented processing model. It would be nice for the spec to  
acknowledge this.

Therefore, I suggest calling apps that have the following properties  
conforming with some qualifications:
  * The UA is a conforming XHTML5 UA.
  * The UA is able to convert any conforming HTML5 document into a  
conforming XHTML5 document and process the result.
  * text/html byte streams that are not conforming HTML5 documents  
are not handled per spec (e.g. they are shoehorned into well-formed  
XHTML by means other than the prescribed parsing algorithm or they  
are rejected in a Draconian way or some combination of those).
