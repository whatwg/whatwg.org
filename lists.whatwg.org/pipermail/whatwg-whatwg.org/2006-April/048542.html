<PRE>
putPixels is just a cover for drawing a bunch of 1 x 1 rects. And in  
general it won't be much more efficient than that, due to possible  
device scaling. Is drawing a bunch of 1x1 rects a common enough use  
case to be worth it? Seems like it would almost always be better  
solved by drawing an image or using other drawing calls.

getPixels, as others have mentioned, is hard to define sensibly when  
the canvas backing store is higher resolution than the canvas  
coordinate space.

Calling these &quot;pixels&quot; also seems misleading since they are neither  
device pixels nor CSS px units.

Proposed alternate design:

1) Add a call to allow copying a rect from one canvas to another. You  
may want to be able to control the compositing mode for this. Then  
you can use an offscreen canvas to store a bitmap for later drawing  
into your visible canvas. If this involves a change of size the  
implementation has the opportunity to apply intelligent scaling.

2) Add an averageColorInRect call for the benefit of &quot;eyedropper&quot;  
type tools.

I'm actually not sure how people intend to use getPixels / putPixels  
so I'm not 100% sure this covers the use cases.

Maciej

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the opposite of getPixels; the given array must be exactly width
