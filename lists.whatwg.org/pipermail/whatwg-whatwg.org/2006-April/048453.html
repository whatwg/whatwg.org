Changing id in some cases to an attribute that does not have the ID  
nature would be problematic, but see below.

</I>
I agree that editor-friendliness is a worthy goal. I have been  
keeping it in mind, even though I have not actually been testing  
schemas in any RELAX NG-aware editor.

Schematron is not amenable to editor autocompletion features, but in  
*theory* it could be used for discovering errors by running the  
validation function over the document being edited from time to time.

&gt;<i> RelaxNG /can/ do IDREF integrity checks.
</I>
It turns out that the ID nature in RELAX NG DTD Compatibility does  
*not* require the ID value to be an NCName. That is a further  
restriction imposed by the <A HREF="http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/">http://relaxng.org/ns/compatibility/</A> 
datatypes/1.0 and <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes</A> datatype  
libraries. The ID nature itself only requires that that the ID value  
does not contain whitespace.

I spent quite a while today verifying (by implementing a more  
permissive ID datatype library) that James Clark's Jing agrees with  
my reading of the spec. It does, which is good evidence that my  
reading of the spec is correct. :-)

I don't know what kind of datatype library support Etna has or will  
have, but theoretically, it could even allow using Jing/MSV- 
compatible libraries via JNI. (That could actually be a worthwhile  
feature considering that Java API for datatype libraries is probably  
the most popular one.)

There is a problem, however. One of the main features of RELAX NG is  
that it allows ambiguous grammars: It is OK for a document to be  
valid according to multiple derivations. RELAX NG DTD Compatibility  
restricts grammar ambiguity, because the IDness of an attribute can't  
remain ambiguous. It appear that enabling ID/IDREF checking wreaks  
havoc with schemas that have not been written with this in mind.

I have not yet assessed the extent of the damage, but it could turn  
out that ID/IDREF checking needs to go in a separate schema like  
exclusions. (Does Etna support multiple schemas at a time effectively  
ANDing them?)

&gt;<i> The part about form
</I>&gt;<i> attributes referencing only form elements can be checked by  
</I>&gt;<i> Schematron.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> From an authoring standpoint, the *most* useful part of IDREF  
</I>&gt;<i> integrity
</I>&gt;<i> checking is to check against typos, not against misinterpretation  
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> idref attribute's intent. :)
</I>
OK.
