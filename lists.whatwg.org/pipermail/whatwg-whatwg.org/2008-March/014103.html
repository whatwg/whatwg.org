</I>
So this draft makes one of the two endpoints cross scope, i.e. it is 
created in one window, and are then passed over to the other. This is a 
major pain security wise. For example, what happens to expando 
properties set on the object? Currently only window and location objects 
cross scopes as useful objects and there have been several security 
issues with this due to being hard to implement.

I would instead suggest having an api such as:

window A:
myPipe = createMessagePipe();
myPipe.onmessage = function(e) { alert(&quot;A got this:&quot; + e.message) }
otherWindow.postMessage(&quot;here ya go&quot;, myPipe);
alert(&quot;posted&quot;);

window B:
window.onmessage = function (e) {
   pipeFromOtherGuy = e.pipe;
   pipeFromOtherGuy.onmessage = function () { alert(&quot;ack from B&quot;) }
   pipe.postMessage(&quot;thanks!&quot;);
   setTimeout(sendMoreStuff, 10);
}

sendMoreStuff() {
   pipeFromOtherGuy.postMessage(&quot;more stuff&quot;);
}


The messages are synchronous so this would alert, in order:
A got this:thanks!
ack from B
posted
A got this:more stuff
ack from B


This also generally seems simpler. If you try to pass a pipe to 
postMessage that has aleady has been passed in an earlier postMessage 
call an exception is thrown.

I too am strongly in favor of having synchronous message. Asynchronous 
things are in general harder for developers to understand. And while 
Synchronous things generally are evil when it comes to network loads, I 
see no such problems here.
