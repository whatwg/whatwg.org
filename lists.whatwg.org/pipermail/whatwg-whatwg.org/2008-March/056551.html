I agree that the semantic fig leaf is confusing. It means  
&quot;hidden&quot; (from all interaction modes).

&gt;<i> I understand your point about superfluity being defined by the

</I>&gt;<i> styles, it doesn't really help.
</I>
More to the point, it is unreasonable to expect casual authors to  
supply sensible aural CSS even if it were supported.

&gt;<i> I still feel like it's a good idea to have an optional attribute on  
</I>&gt;<i> each element that indicates the element's content should not be  
</I>&gt;<i> ignored by screen readers regardless of the style applied. Perhaps  
</I>&gt;<i> this could be better handled by an ARIA role...
</I>

As currently drafted, ARIA has aria-hidden, which is essentially a  
less elegant duplicate of HTML5 'irrelevant'. As far as I can tell,  
ARIA doesn't specify aria-hidden=false as overriding display: none; in  
accessibility API exposure. (But then in general, ARIA doesn't specify  
processing requirements in the way we expect from HTML5.)
