<PRE>
Executive summary:

 * Changed the &rang; and &lang; entities (which we'd already changed 
   anyway) to something more appropriate. (r1286)

 * Made a number of things parse errors to allow conformance checkers to 
   catch common attribute mistakes. (r1292, r1293, r1299, r1303)

 * Made a number of changes to parsing for compatibility reasons: entities 
   no longer get parsed betwen comments in RCDATA elements, three more 
   ways to trigger quirks mode, made DOCTYPE parsing not trigger quirks 
   mode if there's trailing garbage (r1294, r1302, r1306)

 * Made entities at the end of an attribute be not a parse error. (r1296)

 * A number of editorial changes. (in range r1286 - r1307)

Well, we'd changed them anyway (since before they mapped to non-canonical 
characters); changing them to something better seems at least partially 
sensible... Browsers are pretty poor on these two entities anyway.

When should we allow them? The requirements here are pretty complicated 
already, and stray &lt;s aren't a common error, based on Henri's data. Do we 
really want to allow them?

With the exception of treating entities like real characters, which I do 
not think is a good idea, we currently do what IE does, except with LFs 
instead of CRs. Which happens to match Firefox, yes. This seems like the 
optimal situation to me. What's the benefit of further complicating the 
newline processing by making CRLF detection happen after tokenisation 
instead of before?

I'm very skeptical about introducing entities for the codes that are

I don't know enough about the others to have an educated opinion. I can 
set up a search to examine the data in more detail.

Surrogates aren't characters. They are meaningless (and should be treated 
as FFFD) outside of UTF-16. The spec is correct in its current 
description, I believe. Browsers that currently allow surrogate pairs to 
be passed in and that then treat them as UTF-16 are probably using UTF-16 
internally.

I agree that it would be good to magically make things silently work 
without failing to catch the mistakes -- ironically, right now we are 
complaining about the working cases and silently failing when people 
accidentally match an entity. But I don't know how to do it.

Both somewhat true points, but I think it is still bad that we would fail
