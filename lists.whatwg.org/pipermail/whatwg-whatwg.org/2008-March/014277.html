</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>W3C staff report through a variety of documented means to their 
stakeholders (including at regular events, Web Conference, TPs etc), 
they have named and documented roles grounded in the W3C Process, a 
class of document for airing their proposals to the wider community 
(Team notes) as well as strong internal-transparency via extensive 
internal email, cvs and irc logging so that new team-members can have 
access to previous discussions.

Is this the equivalence you have in mind?

W3C staff as a group culture (nothing personal here; I was one myself 
years) also have a tendency to be a little over-secretive, insular, and 
too often slip into thinking of themselves as having to heroically 
figure out what to do internally before presenting an external opinion. 
Get a tight-knit, smart and distributed group of people together with a 
sense of mission, and that's a hard trait to avoid.

I hope you'll lean towards the public accountability side of things here.

</I>Thanks, interesting. Is a version history and change-log available, 
beyond what can be discerned from 
<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.whatwg.org/charter">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.whatwg.org/charter</A> ?
 From the outside it is hard to understand how the charter has evolved 
over time.

cheers,

Dan
