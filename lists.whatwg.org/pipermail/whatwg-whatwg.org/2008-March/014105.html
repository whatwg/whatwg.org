</I>
Personally it's something I would be very reluctant to do. It would add 
a whole lot of code for basically no benefit for web developers. I have 
never heard of anyone that actually desired changing the base uri for 
all or parts of a page dynamically.

There would definitely be overhead unfortunately. First of all in lots 
of code added to every place that resolves URIs in order to set up 
appropriate listeners to the notification, and managing the lifetime of 
those listeners. Second there would be memory overhead in keeping around 
lists of who listens to what subtrees.

My guess is that supporting dynamic modifications would be one of those 
features that someone would file a bug on early on during testing of a 
UA implementation, and then nobody would care about a very long time, 
including both web developers and UA developers. Especially given that 
the feature would be missing from all other UAs.

But yeah, I have no real good solution either. We could either say that 
uris MAY not be immediately updated in the face of dynamic 
modifications. Which would probably suffer from some amout of 
implementation differences. Or we could say MUST be immediately updated 
and probably still suffer from implemenation differences due to lack of 
implementation.
