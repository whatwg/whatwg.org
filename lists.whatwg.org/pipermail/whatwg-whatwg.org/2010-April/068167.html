</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The feature is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I have a list of small pictures arranged in a sequence of lines
</I>&gt;<i> - I can select or unselect pictures by clicking them
</I>&gt;<i> - I can drag the selected pictures to a new location, to reorder them
</I>&gt;<i> - When I start dragging I have a drag image that shows what is being
</I>&gt;<i>   dragged
</I>&gt;<i> - It is possible to select non-continuous ranges of pictures
</I>&gt;<i> - Pictures are arranged in sections represented by a picture-sized box
</I>&gt;<i>   with the name of the section, followed by the section's pictures
</I>&gt;<i>   themselves
</I>&gt;<i> - It is possible to select a section, in which case all its pictures are
</I>&gt;<i>   selected
</I>&gt;<i> - When dragging, I want to update the drag image with information about
</I>&gt;<i>   what happens should you drop things over here
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried several approaches for setting the drag image:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Use Selection to instruct the browser of what is selected, and leave
</I>&gt;<i>   the drag image alone, as this gives me the best drag image since
</I>&gt;<i>   non-continuous images are represented with the selection &quot;holes&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i>   the drag image.
</I>&gt;<i> - Create a new DOM element to represent the selection and put some info
</I>&gt;<i>   in there like how many images are selected and a few of the images
</I>&gt;<i>   stacked together.
</I>&gt;<i> - The same using a canvas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using the window.getSelection is nice visually but there's no way to
</I>&gt;<i> update the drag image with contextual information. Also when adding the
</I>&gt;<i> section boxes to the selection, their text becomes visually selected and
</I>&gt;<i> that looks bad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did not find it possible to use a new DOM element to represent the
</I>&gt;<i> selection, unless I append it to the document, which looks bad, since
</I>&gt;<i> it's only meant for the selection.
</I>
The spec actually already supports this case -- when the drag starts, call 
dataTransfer.addElement() for each element that is being dragged.

</I>
The state of the keyboard is in the drag events, so this shouldn't be 
necessary.

</I>
Why would you need to know the original state? Surely it doesn't matter 
how the user got to that state, you just need the current state.

It's what IE does.

Why would this use the keyboard? Surely the folder should just open while 
the user drags over it.


&gt;<i> I also have a question regarding DnD started in an external application:

</I>&gt;<i> lot (when we don't get drag or dragstart events), perhaps it should be
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in the spec?
</I>
You can detect it when you get a dragover anywhere in the document. 
However, since the user might be dragging over your window on the way to 
another window, you'll have to keep track of the dragleave events also, to 
make sure you don't keep the highlights up past the point of the last 
dragleave.

</I>
The events bubble, so you can use either a capture or bubbling listener 
at the top of the document hierarchy (or whatever element represents the 
area over which the user has to hover before you show drag targets).

</I>
It's better to have the browsers implement one thing than two things, 
since if they have to implement two things it'll take them twice as long 
to make them both bug-free.

However, even beyond this, having every Web page be notified whenever the 
user drags anything in any other app or Web page seems a bit weird, 
possibly even a sort of weak privacy violation.

The spec basically is just describing what IE does. The API as a whole 
makes very little sense beyond this, sadly.
