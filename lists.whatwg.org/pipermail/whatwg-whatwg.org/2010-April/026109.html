</I>I don't know whether I would be happy, if all headings in my document 
were shown *BIG*, 'cause I use h1 everywhere. I would much more 
appreciate them to be unstyled. (But this is only personal opinion.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But not to existing HTML4 UAs...
</I>As said above, I think it increases backwards compatibility by omitting 
all styles. But it depends on the case whether it's better to have only 
big titles or only unstyled titles.

I easily think that using h1 everywhere isn't semantically correct. 
Especially if the subsections (with their h1s) cannot be redistributed 
solely it does not make any sense.

&lt;h&gt; would mark up a heading, &lt;h1&gt; does mark up an heading of highest rank.

But maybe you are right. The html5 spec is already blown up with stuff 
nobody will ever use (keygen?) enough. In this case less is probably more.
