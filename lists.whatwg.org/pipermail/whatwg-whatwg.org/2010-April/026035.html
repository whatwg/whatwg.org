&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, the autofocus attribute specification [1] is quite
</I>&gt;<i> permissive: only one element should have the autofocus enabled in the
</I>&gt;<i> document but each time an element with autofocus is inserted into the
</I>&gt;<i> document, the UA should give it the focus. The UA can disable the
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus request for some reasons like if the user is already typing
</I>&gt;<i> into a document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The specification uses the term &quot;user&quot; in double meaning, in the same sentence:

|<i> The autofocus content attribute allows the user to
</I>|<i> indicate that a control is to be focused as soon as the
</I>|<i> page is loaded, allowing the user to just start typing
</I>|<i> without having to manually focus the main control.
</I>
Change to:
&quot;The autofocus content attribute allows the author...&quot;

&gt;<i> As far as I know, the autofocus attribute has been introduced to
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus a form field during the load process to prevent doing that in
</I>&gt;<i> js and thus focusing an element after the load of the document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To better fulfill this need, I think we should add two rules for the
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus attribute behavior:
</I>&gt;<i> - only the first element with the autofocus attribute specified should
</I>&gt;<i> get the focus. All other autofocus requests should be ignored. This is
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same for authors because they should not have more than one
</I>&gt;<i> element with the autofocus attribute specified but that would be better
</I>&gt;<i> for the user because it will prevent autofocus to move from a field to
</I>&gt;<i> another.
</I>
Right; having focus shift from one control to another would be bad.

The author adding a second autofocus'd element to the page might
observe that the element does not get autofocus. It is then his task
to correct his mistake and remove autofocus from the first.

&gt;<i> - if an element with the autofocus attribute specified is inserted after
</I>&gt;<i> the load event (or the 'DOMContentLoaded' event) it should not get the
</I>&gt;<i> focus. Having an element inserted in the document with the autofocus
</I>&gt;<i> attribute specified is just a way to prevent using .focus(). That is not
</I>&gt;<i> why autofocus has been introduced. If an author want to focus an element
</I>&gt;<i> after the load event, he/she should use .focus().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Using focus() is easy enough to do.

&gt;<i> What is your opinion about these two propositions ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The autofocus encourages inherently bad usability. See my response to
Jonas as well as timeless' example.

&gt;<i> [1] <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/forms.html#attr-fe-autofocus">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/forms.html#attr-fe-autofocus</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That page is heavy and throws javascript errors.

Firefox 3.6:
&quot;uncaught exception: Failed to find TOC&quot;

IE7 has three errors:
1) &quot;Exception thrown and not caught.&quot;
2) &quot;Object doesn't support this property or method.&quot;
3) &quot;Object doesn't support this property or method.&quot;

Ouch.
