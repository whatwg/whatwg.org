Really?  Given:

   &lt;h&gt;This is a header&lt;/h&gt;
   This is some text after the header.

The &quot;unstyled&quot; rendering you would see is:

   This is a headerThis is some text after the header.

If the &lt;h&gt; is followed by a block you're better off, of course, but the 
common case from what I've seen is to just have something like the above.

&gt;<i> As said above, I think it increases backwards compatibility by omitting

</I>
The latter wouldn't look like titles at all, right?

&gt;<i> I easily think that using h1 everywhere isn't semantically correct.

I'm not sure I follow.

&gt;<i> But maybe you are right. The html5 spec is already blown up with stuff

</I>
Amusingly enough, keygen is something I use once a year or so (when my 
user certificate expires), and something that MIT students need to use 
to, say, register for classes (or view their grades, deal with bursar's 
office stuff online, etc, etc).  See <A HREF="https://ca.mit.edu/ca/certgen">https://ca.mit.edu/ca/certgen</A> 
(though that will likely require a login... that you may not have).  See 
<A HREF="http://ist.mit.edu/services/certificates">http://ist.mit.edu/services/certificates</A> for the various documentation.
