</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in them. But we would not commit to interpreting every special markup
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that some author came up with that worked in his particular player.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be a native Web format in my eyes. It is just interpreted for the Web.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;TTML is not supposed to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a native Web format&quot;? Once browsers add support for it, it becomes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> native web format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you call SRT a native Web format, too?
</I>
If we were to implement it directly in browsers, yes.

&gt;<i> Are RSS and ATOM native Web formats?
</I>
Most definitely.

I guess it comes down to a matter of definition of &quot;native web
format&quot;. As a browser implementor I think of it as anything that I
have to implement and maintain to the level of quality that we want
the web to work. As a web author I think of it as any format that I am
able to use.

&gt;&gt;<i> No matter if the implementation behind the scenes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> map xsl:fo to CSS or through some other means. Netscape 4 implemented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CSS by mapping it to JSSS [1], however for all any web developer ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knew, Netscape 4 supported CSS. Poorly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CSS is much tighter linked to HTML than a timed text format. If your
</I>&gt;<i> UA happens to not support TTML, only one feature will be missing, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> timed text on your video. That doesn't destroy your Web page. But lack
</I>&gt;<i> of CSS support does.
</I>
I guess I don't fully agree with you, but I think we've gotten side
tracked as I don't think this matters to the question at hand.

&gt;&gt;<i> I really do hate to come up with a new format. But I think TTML is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> severely off the mark for what we want. Am I wrong in that marking up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dialogue vs. sound effects vs. narrator vs. descriptions is important?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or at least more useful than for example the ability to set the text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outline blur radius?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think your requirement is off the mark. I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> something that current caption formats don't do, since there hasn't
</I>&gt;<i> been a need and nobody has really looked at them from a Web
</I>&gt;<i> background. Therefore it wasn't included in TTML. I also have multiple
</I>&gt;<i> requirements that are not satisfied by TTML. I was under the
</I>&gt;<i> impression that we can fix up TTML with such extensions. But if people
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to develop a new format, that's fine by me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't mean though that we can ignore TTML. For what it has been
</I>&gt;<i> developed - for use in captions in all sorts of environment, which
</I>&gt;<i> include for example digital TV and mobile devices - it has been good
</I>&gt;<i> and its use is spreading.
</I>
That's unfortunate to hear indeed. If there is a substantial body of
content produced in TTML, and this body of content gets published on
the web, then I agree that we indeed will have to reconsider.
