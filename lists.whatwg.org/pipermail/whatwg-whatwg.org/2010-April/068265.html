<PRE>FYI: as of now, WebKit Workers 'close()' behavior is following the results
of this thread and is compatible with FF (except we don't implement close
event, as mentioned here).

Thanks for clarifications!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think fallback is to be considered an exceptional case. Especially as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time goes on and more browsers implement support for the new type.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The question is, what are the actual concrete cases where people will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be sending DOM nodes? Without concrete cases, it's easy to construct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; artificial cases that prove this to be better one way or the other.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Say sending a DOM that the user has edited (using contentEditable) which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the worker will convert into a ODF document and send to the server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Personally, I think throwing an exception fits in with the spec's use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; of them elsewhere (i.e., cross-document and web workers.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Where do we use exceptions for extension points in a similar way?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For circular object graphs in the very same algorithms.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It does matter because if you send null, the worker has to respond that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it got null so the script can do what it wants on the main thread, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes the operation async and means the worker script needs logic for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the non-supported case. It's more convenient to catch an exception and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do what you want directly, and have the worker script only care about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the supported case.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is actually the exact same problem as what we have now, moving from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string based to structured clone. In order to test structured clone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support, you have to send a message back and forth. I think it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been better if non-strings threw an exception from the start, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's too late to change it now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A use case I had with structured clone is posting three ImageData
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objects where the worker compares the pixels of two of them and puts the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference on the third and posts that one back. I do it in a worker
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it's a heavy operation for big images and I needed to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; timing correct for events in the main thread. If workers isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supported, I did the operation later when the timing of events didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matter. I didn't make it detect support for workers but lack of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structured clone because it seemed too annoying to implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. I've changed the cloning mechanism to throw an exception
</I>&gt;<i> instead of nulling host objects.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...] close() method on WorkerGlobalScope.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In particular, the spec seems to imply that after calling close() inside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the worker, the JS does not get terminated right away, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continues to execute, while an internal 'closing' flag is set and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message queue associated with the worker discards all the tasks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing and future. Also, all ports are immediately disentangled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've changed the spec based no the feedback below so that the ports are no
</I>&gt;<i> longer disentangled upon calling close().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems to leave some questions without explicit answer, with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; differences in current implementations:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Does this code in a worker continues looping until the parent page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unloads:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  close();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  while(true) {}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WebKit V8 terminates, WebKit JCS terminates after a timeout, FF does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terminate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FF is correct. The WebKits are not non-conforming, though, since you're
</I>&gt;<i> basically allowed to kill workers whenver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Do the errors propagate back to Worker object after close()?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; close();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nonExistingFunction();  &lt;&lt;-- throws, if not processed locally, posts
</I>&gt;<i> error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info to the Worker object.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In WebKit and FF errors propagate, although it does not seem consistent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while worker closed all the ports and is in a dormant state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec seems clear that close() has no effect on error propagation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Should synchronous operations work after close()? Asynchronous ones
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps should not, because of the event loop queue which is stopped...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; close();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;foo.com&quot;, *false*);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; xhr.send();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WebKit: does not work (mostly), FF - does work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anything depending on tasks doesn't work. Sync XHR doesn't seem to use the
</I>&gt;<i> event loop mechanism, so it's ok.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps it would be simpler to either say nothing is
</I>&gt;<i> executed/posted/fired
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after close() (immediate termination), or to enable worker run unimpeded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (with ports open, etc) until it naturally yields from JS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've gone with the latter.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll note that the spec gives the UA an significant amount of latitude
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about its behavior after close() is called:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; User agents may invoke the &quot;kill a worker &lt;#kill-a-worker&gt;&quot; processing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; model on a worker at any time, e.g. in response to user requests, in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; response to CPU quota management, or when a worker stops being an active
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needed worker&lt;#active-needed-worker&gt; if the worker continues executing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even after its closing&lt;#dom-workerglobalscope-closing&gt; flag was set to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; true.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Essentially, UAs can kill a worker at any time, and since the &quot;kill a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worker&quot; algorithm allows UAs to abort the script after a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user-agent-defined amount of time (including zero), it seems like almost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any behavior post-close is compliant. This seems like a guaranteed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source of cross-browser incompatibilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also allows killing scripts pre-close. We don't really have much choice
</I>&gt;<i> here; browsers need to be able to terminate any malware or runaway
</I>&gt;<i> process at their whim, basically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've always operated under the impression that the intent of the spec is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to allow pending worker operations to complete, but still give UAs the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ability to abort scripts that don't exit in a timely manner (so close()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should not immediately abort the script), but I don't see anything in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the spec regarding this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is what the spec now requires, modulo UAs being allowed to bail on
</I>&gt;<i> worker scripts at any time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For #2 [above], I believe that exceptions in worker context should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *always* be reported, regardless of closing state. Section 4.6 (Runtime
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; script errors) makes no mention of tying this behavior to the closing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if we say close() lets script run until completion (but prevents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; further messages/events from dispatching), then perhaps we don't need it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at all - there is nothing then that script in the worker can not do to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same effect (unregister onmessage, clear timers etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It can be a lot harder to actually find all the various things that are
</I>&gt;<i> keeping a worker alive than just to call close().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That means letting worker to call close() on itself only makes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; additional sense if it is specified as immediate termination. It could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be useful and it can be specified in deterministic manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that immediate termination might also be useful, but if that's
