</I>&gt;<i> &gt; second, so that you can store state that you wouldn't store in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URL, because it only applies to the current Document instance and you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have to reconstruct it if a new Document were opened.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An example of the latter would be something like keeping track of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; precise coordinate from which a popup &lt;div&gt; was made to animate, so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that if the user goes back, it can be made to animate to the same 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; location. Or alternatively, it could be used to keep a pointer into a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cache of data that would be fetched from the server based on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information in the URL, so that when going back and forward, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information doesn't have to be fetched again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically any information that is not information that you would not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include in a URL describing the page, but which could be useful when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going backwards and forwards in the history.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can we publish this somewhere?  This is crucial and not obvious.

Done.


&gt;<i> Does it make sense to persist the fact that two history entries with 
</I>&gt;<i> (potentially) different URLs correspond to the same document across 
</I>&gt;<i> session history?  If pushState is supposed to replace using the hash to 
</I>&gt;<i> store data, then we should persist this fact across session restores, 
</I>&gt;<i> right?  But then we have to also persist the state data; otherwise, if 
</I>&gt;<i> the page used pushState with no URL argument, it wouldn't be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish between the two states.
</I>
The spec says you should store the relationship:

|<i> Entries that have had their Document objects discarded must, for the 
</I>|<i> purposes of the algorithms given below, act as if they had not. When the 
</I>|<i> user or script navigates back or forwards to a page which has no 
</I>|<i> in-memory DOM objects, any other entries that shared the same Document 
</I>|<i> object with it must share the new object as well.
</I>
Consider what happens with navigation around a document with just a hash, 
for instance. I think that makes sense. However, pages might get mighty 
confused that they are getting state objects that no longer make sense, if 
they're not careful.
