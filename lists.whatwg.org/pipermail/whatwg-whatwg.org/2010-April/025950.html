I imagine the main use-case where this sort of behaviour might be expected is a Javascript application which dynamically adds a new form to the page based on some user interaction and one of those fields should be autofocused when it's been added to the DOM.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose you could argue that it'd be up to the application to go and *remove* the previous autofocus attribute from the search field, or should manage focus as they currently do with HTMLInputElement.focus(), but I can see the simplicity that automatically moving the focus would represent for these sorts of applications.

You basically only have a 50/50 percent chance of things working
anyway. You're assuming that the new forms will always be added after
the new ones. It seems to me that it's quite likely that they will be
before.

Worse, the spec (IMHO rightly) suggests that if the user is already
interacting with another part of the page, the autofocus attribute
should be ignored. So in this case the 'compose' link will be focused,
and so the UA should IMHO assume that the user is interacting with
that link. Thus it would not focus the newly inserted form control.
