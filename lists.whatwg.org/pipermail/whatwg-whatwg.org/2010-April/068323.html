No accesskeys or tabbing?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, that was established. The problem is that c2 gets focus; the
developer won't notice that; but the user on the slow wifi connection
will get a very bad experience when the focus is shifting
automatically.

I can easily see such problem being created on a project where a page
happens to have two features with autofocus, uses multiple includes,
and has different developers working on separate features.

The proposed behavior would help eliminate problems like that because
when a second autofocus is added, it won't get autofocused. The
developer should then notice that his autofocus did not work and
problem should be more obvious. My comments were an argument to
justify the proposed change.

Considering a case where a page contains an iframe, the iframe's
content is replaced entirely:-

iframeDoc.body.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;input autofocus type='text'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;

- should the input get autofocus or not?

What other edge cases are there?

(I still think its a bad feature).
