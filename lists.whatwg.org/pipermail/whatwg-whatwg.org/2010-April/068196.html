When implementing one complex spec (TTML + XSL-FO) in terms of another
complex spec (HTML + CSS), you have to be very very lucky to find that all
the features map perfectly, even if the specs were designed to work together
that way, which in this case they are not. Even if you're lucky today,
evolution of the specs could easily accidentally break things.

We could make that problem go away by normatively defining something that
looks like TTML in terms of a translation to HTML + CSS. It wouldn't really
be TTML though, and where's the added value for authors?

I understand the deep political problems here, but I think it's most logical
for styled content for the Web to use (possibly a subset of) HTML and CSS.
Server-side tools to translate between TTML and HTML+CSS would be one way to
address the desire to interoperate with TTML.
