<PRE>HI Ian,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IIUC the idea is to focus on the core problem at hand which right now

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to reconsider this for lyrics and chapter markers. I'm ok with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moving the others to a later stage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one page was starting to cover more topics than I could fit in my head
</I>&gt;<i> at once. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two pages are both things I think we need to support in the first
</I>&gt;<i> version. The first page (timed_tracks) is stuff that needs in-video
</I>&gt;<i> rendering, and that therefore affects whatever formatting model we end up
</I>&gt;<i> using. The stuff on the second page (use_cases_for_API-level_access_to_
</I>&gt;<i> timed_tracks) is stuff that only affects the UI or APIs but that I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't expect the browser itself to render natively without script.
</I>
Ok, that was obviously a misunderstanding.


&gt;&gt;<i> Firstly about the Lyrics. I think they are just the same as captions and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should go back into the first document. In particular since we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talking about captions and subtitles for both the &lt;video&gt; and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;audio&gt; element and this shows some good examples of how lyrics are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being displayed as time-aligned text with audio resources. Most of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples are widgets used on the Web, so I think they are totally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the examples are off-video lyrics
</I>
Those other examples are not off-video, they have no video and are
audio-related. I wanted some examples for the &lt;audio&gt; element, too.


&gt;<i> except one which I presume everyone
</I>&gt;<i> would agree should require script or at least SMIL+SVG. This suggests to
</I>&gt;<i> me that they are all things we should handle as part of an API, and not as
</I>&gt;<i> a native built-in feature.
</I>
Yes, the API would be important there.



&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also confused about the removal of the chapter tracks. These are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also time-aligned text files and again look very similar to SRT. Here
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is an extract of a QTtext chapter track example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {QTtext} {size:16} {font:Lucida Grande} {width:320} {height:42}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {language:0} {textColor:65535,65535,65535} {backColor:0,0,0}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {doNotAutoScale:off} {timeScale:100} {timeStamps:absolute}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {justify:center}
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [00:00:09.30]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Chocolate Rain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [00:00:12.00]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some stay dry and others feel the pain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [00:00:16.00]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Chocolate Rain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [00:00:18.00]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A baby born will die before the sin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, chapter markers are clearly something that fits into the same
</I>&gt;<i> model and should be supported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Those are some damn short chapters. Are you sure that's not a lyric
</I>&gt;<i> track?)
</I>
It was an example that I had available. I am not concerned about the
actual content of it but rather about the general format of chapter
tracks. But yes, the example was indeed a transcoding from song
lyrics.


&gt;&gt;<i> So, while I can understand that you currently want to focus on just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solving captions and subtitles, I think it is important to keep other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time-aligned text applications that can be solved in the exact same way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of the design to keep an open mind about general time-aligned text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The split was not intended to indicate a lack of desire to support these
</I>&gt;<i> use cases in whatever format we eventually pick or adapt (or invent, if
</I>&gt;<i> necessary, though I'd really like to avoid that). Sorry for any confusion.
</I>

Thanks for clarifying. I was a bit shocked when I got back to the page
and all my work seemed to have been removed. This all makes sense now.
Thanks.

Cheers,
Silvia.
