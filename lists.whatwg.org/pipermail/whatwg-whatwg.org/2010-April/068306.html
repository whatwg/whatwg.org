</I>
Why is the manager making decisions about U/X? Does he believe he is
qualified to do that? Unless somebody properly tells him otherwise, he
may likely go on believing that.

&gt;<i> as a result users often have text they're typing spread across at
</I>&gt;<i> least two input areas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is it username and password? GMail does that, changing focus around on
me and it is annoying when I get the error message telling me that I
typed the wrong password when I didn't; gmail just changed focus
around on me and that caused a problem.

&gt;<i> needless to say, our users/engineers are not amused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Did you demonstrate the problems? There is a chance that he is totally
ignorant to the consequences of doing that. Maybe his typing is also
slow or maybe he doesn't use the feature repeatedly/

&gt;<i> also note that dom insertion is somewhat random, so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &lt;input id=c1 autofocus&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &lt;input id=c2 autofocus&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> could either focus c1, or it could focus c2, depending on random-ish
</I>&gt;<i> things like packet size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, and that code would surely e a mistake; perhaps using two
separate include files. The developer adding the second might wonder:
Why does c2 not get focus? He would find his mistake, eventually
(hopefully soon!) and fix it.
