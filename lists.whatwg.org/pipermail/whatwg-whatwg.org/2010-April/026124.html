</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the case that the &lt;h1&gt;-only approach, selecting each level of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selectors, where n is the heading level minus one. In other words: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> top level heading can be selected with &quot;h1&quot;, but the next level would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require &quot;section h1, nav h1, aside h1, article h1, ...&quot;, then for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> third level we go nuts (the example is limited to &lt;section&gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; elements, including all of them would yield a list of too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many selectors): &quot;section section h1, section article h1, article
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section h1, article article h1&quot;. A four level would translate into 64
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selectors or more (already quite insane to author), and if we ever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reach the fifth and further levels, we'll be dealing with hundreds or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thousands of selectors. If this isn't insane enough, keep in mind that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is an over-simplification. Sure, there are combinations that will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never happen, but if we have to select also sub-headings inside a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt; things get pretty funny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not true. &#160;The CSSWG has a proposal (with unresolved issues, however)
</I>&gt;<i> for an :any() pseudoclass which works perfectly in this case:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :any(section, nav, aside, article) h1 { foo }
</I>&gt;<i> :any(section, nav, aside, article) :any(section, nav, aside, article) h1 { bar }
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In other words, the &quot;x&quot; selector in the spec is just the :any() selector here.)
</I>There is a subtle, but quite important, difference: something like
&quot;section section h1&quot; would work on all major browsers (with a minor JS
hack for IE to deal with &quot;unknown&quot; elements). Any currently works
nowhere (ok, we have :-moz-any() courtesy of David Baron, and I really
appreciate it; but it's simply useless for the scenario).

Even if an hypothetical  CSS3.1 Selectors got fast-tracked and
recommended by tomorrow, a key problem would still be there: authors
have no sane means to get HTML5'ish headings decently styled (I don't
need perfect, but some degree of *graceful* degradation is generally
needed) on current browsers.



&gt;&gt;<i> This yields several advantages:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) The styling issue improves drastically: any pre-HTML5 will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand this (IE would require a bit of javascript anyway) out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the box:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> h1 { styling for top-level }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section h1 { styling for second-level }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section section h1 { styling for third-level }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so on, for as many levels as you need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fixing HTML because CSS is too difficult probably isn't the right
</I>&gt;<i> solution. &#160;Address the problem at the source - CSS needs to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> handle this case well. &#160;Luckily there are further similar use-cases
</I>&gt;<i> that make solving this problem fairly attractive.
</I>Actually, I *am* trying to fix the problem at the source. This is not
about fixing HTML because CSS being difficult. It's about fixing a
design issue within HTML itself. The problems from the CSS perspective
are only a surface symptom of a deeper issue.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) All of a sudden, something like &lt;section kind=&quot;aside nav&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;See
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also&lt;/h1&gt; some indirectly related links here...&lt;/section&gt; becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible, plus easy to style, and works happily with the outlining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the benefit of marking something as both an &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;nav&gt;?
</I>Quoting the HTML5 spec:
&quot;The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other
pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.&quot;
&quot;The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of
content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside
element, and which could be considered separate from that content.&quot;
Putting that together, a section that links to other pages *and*
consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around
it *must* be *both* a nav and an aside. The most blatant example
(which I thought was clear enough from the example) are &quot;See also&quot;
sections found on many sites (see a couple of examples on [1] and
[2]). Currently, the closest thing we may get is
&lt;nav&gt;&lt;aside&gt;...&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/nav&gt; or &lt;aside&gt;&lt;nav&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;. This
raises several concerns: which one should be the outer, and which the
inner section? How would that interact with the sectioning algorithm?
(ie: would a heading inside there be taken as one level lower than the
expected one?).


&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Future needs will become easier to solve on future versions of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specification, and with significantly smaller costs: for example,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let's assume a new sectioning element such as &lt;attachment&gt; becomes a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> widespread need (it would already make sense on sites like web-mail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services, discussion boards, bug-trackers, and some others...). So a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new crouton on the soup, which would be treated quite like a generic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt; by pre-HTML6 (or 7, or whatever) browsers. Now, with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;+attribute approach, we'd get something like &lt;section
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind=&quot;attachment&quot;&gt;: that'd would still work with the outlining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algoryth (it could be treated as generic section), it's styling will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work smoothly, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the problem with just &lt;attachment&gt;? &#160;Styling is easy to update.
</I>The problem is that the outlining algorithm would immediately break on
any UA released before creating such an element. This can mess up with
assistive technologies, some purpose-specific search and/or parsing
utilities, and so on.
With something like &lt;section kind=&quot;attachment&quot;&gt;, of course UAs and
other tools would need to be updated before they understand the
specific meaning of kind=&quot;attachment&quot;, but they would already know
that it is indeed a section and would perform outlining and related
tasks properly.
Since you mention styling, I'll highlight that with the &lt;section
kind=&quot;...&quot;&gt; approach styling wouldn't need to be updated at all. When,
as you claim, styling is easy to update, this is just a marginal
benefit, but still a benefit. But styling is not always easy to update
(from the top of my head, content templating and team-working are a
pair of examples of having significant costs to update styling).
