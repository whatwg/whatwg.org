</I>&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;address&quot;&gt;
</I>
I haven't been following this thread, but for just the styling aspect
of it, the same thing can be accomplished by adding a &quot;section&quot; class
to each of these elements:

&lt;section class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;nav class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
&lt;address class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;

So that this...

&gt;<i> h1 { styling for top-level }
</I>&gt;<i> section h1 { styling for second-level }
</I>&gt;<i> section section h1 { styling for third-level }
</I>
Becomes this:

h1
.section h1
.section .section h1

Regarding your proposal, if I wanted to style the following element
only, what would the CSS look like?

&lt;section kind=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;

Another option along the lines of your proposal, is you could still
have the same functionality without the kind=&quot;*&quot; so that rather than

&gt;<i> &lt;nav&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;aside&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;address&quot;&gt;
</I>
&lt;nav&gt; is treated as &lt;section kind=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside&gt; is treated as &lt;section kind=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;
&lt;article&gt; is treated as &lt;section kind=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;address&gt; is treated as &lt;section kind=&quot;address&quot;&gt;

In this case nav, aside, article, and address are all types of
sections, and so any style added to a section is added to each of
these, with any style added to one of these specific elements
overriding the section style rules.

In both cases you lose the ability to apply CSS to a plain old section
that will not be automatically applied to the other elements. A third
option is to have a quasi-element that refers to all of these but is
never actually used in the HTML. It would just be a tool for CSS and
outlining algorithms. I can't think of a good name for it, but for
example, &quot;sectional&quot; could reference all of the following and anything
else one might thing should go in this list: section, nav, aside,
article, and address. Now you can style section without having to
override that styling in nav, aside, article, and address.

h1
sectional h1
sectional sectional h1

I think this last option might solve the problems without changing the
current html or css, and would simply add a hook for outlining
algorithms and other use cases where you want a clean way to get a
particular element at a particular depth.

Just some thoughts.
