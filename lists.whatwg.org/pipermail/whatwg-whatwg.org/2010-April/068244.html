Fair enough. I've changed the cloning mechanism to throw an exception 
instead of nulling host objects.

</I>
I've changed the spec based no the feedback below so that the ports are no 
longer disentangled upon calling close().


&gt;<i> This seems to leave some questions without explicit answer, with 
</I>&gt;<i> differences in current implementations:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Does this code in a worker continues looping until the parent page
</I>&gt;<i> unloads:
</I>&gt;<i>  ...
</I>&gt;<i>  close();
</I>&gt;<i>  while(true) {}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WebKit V8 terminates, WebKit JCS terminates after a timeout, FF does not 
</I>&gt;<i> terminate.
</I>
FF is correct. The WebKits are not non-conforming, though, since you're 
basically allowed to kill workers whenver.


&gt;<i> 2. Do the errors propagate back to Worker object after close()?
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> close();
</I>&gt;<i> nonExistingFunction();  &lt;&lt;-- throws, if not processed locally, posts error
</I>&gt;<i> info to the Worker object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In WebKit and FF errors propagate, although it does not seem consistent
</I>&gt;<i> while worker closed all the ports and is in a dormant state.
</I>
The spec seems clear that close() has no effect on error propagation.


&gt;<i> 3. Should synchronous operations work after close()? Asynchronous ones
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps should not, because of the event loop queue which is stopped...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> close();
</I>&gt;<i> xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;foo.com&quot;, *false*);
</I>&gt;<i> xhr.send();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WebKit: does not work (mostly), FF - does work.
</I>
Anything depending on tasks doesn't work. Sync XHR doesn't seem to use the 
event loop mechanism, so it's ok.


&gt;<i> Perhaps it would be simpler to either say nothing is executed/posted/fired
</I>&gt;<i> after close() (immediate termination), or to enable worker run unimpeded
</I>&gt;<i> (with ports open, etc) until it naturally yields from JS.
</I>
I've gone with the latter.

</I>&gt;<i> Essentially, UAs can kill a worker at any time, and since the &quot;kill a

</I>&gt;<i> any behavior post-close is compliant. This seems like a guaranteed

</I>
It also allows killing scripts pre-close. We don't really have much choice 
here; browsers need to be able to terminate any malware or runaway 
process at their whim, basically.


&gt;<i> I've always operated under the impression that the intent of the spec is 
</I>&gt;<i> to allow pending worker operations to complete, but still give UAs the 
</I>&gt;<i> ability to abort scripts that don't exit in a timely manner (so close() 
</I>&gt;<i> should not immediately abort the script), but I don't see anything in 
</I>&gt;<i> the spec regarding this.
</I>
This is what the spec now requires, modulo UAs being allowed to bail on 
worker scripts at any time.


&gt;<i> For #2 [above], I believe that exceptions in worker context should 
</I>&gt;<i> *always* be reported, regardless of closing state. Section 4.6 (Runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> script errors) makes no mention of tying this behavior to the closing 
</I>&gt;<i> flag.
</I>
Indeed.

It can be a lot harder to actually find all the various things that are 
keeping a worker alive than just to call close().


&gt;<i> That means letting worker to call close() on itself only makes 
</I>&gt;<i> additional sense if it is specified as immediate termination. It could

</I>
I agree that immediate termination might also be useful, but if that's 
what you want, just don't do anything after calling close(). :-)

</I>&gt;<i> The one thing that we do and that is somewhat iffy is the close event. 
</I>
The close event is no longer in the spec, so at this point it's a Firefox 
proprietary feature. :-) We removed it to prevent exposing GC behaviour, 
because otherwise if pages start depending on one particular behaviour, 
we'll have accidentally forced the GC rules into the platform, which 
seems like an incredibly bad idea.


&gt;<i> [...] it exposes GC behavior. This is very unfortunate indeed and 
</I>&gt;<i> because of it I feel that our implementation is somewhat experimental.
</I>
I would recommend dropping the 'close' event for this reason.
