Understood. But what is actually the cost of implementing all of TTML?
The features in TTML all map onto existing Web technology, so all it
takes is a bit more parsing code over time. And if we chose not to
implement TTML, we will have to eventually support some other format
that provides formatting and positioning capabilities, seeing how the
legal landscape has evolved for traditional media (e.g. TV, set-top
box technology). Since TTML was originally developed to be the
exchange format for all such formats, it should have a sensible set of
features for this space. So, I personally think it's not a bad choice
for the purpose. Which other format did you have in mind to replace
it?


Cheers,
Silvia.
