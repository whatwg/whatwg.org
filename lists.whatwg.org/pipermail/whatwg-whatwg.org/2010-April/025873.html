</I>
Not knowingly, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if there were lots of 
pages that triggered this, yes. People rely on all kinds of weird things. 
(See for example the sample from Philip below.)


&gt;<i> Given that as I understand it such HTML4 processing instructions were 
</I>&gt;<i> not even used by any standard at that time, and with XHTML 1.0+ 
</I>&gt;<i> processing instructions bringing into practice the XML form, and 
</I>&gt;<i> especially with all of the progress made in X/HTML5 on harmonizing HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> and XHTML, I'd think that it'd really be ideal if this issue would not 
</I>&gt;<i> get in the way (along with the unfortunate loss of external DTDs)...
</I>
In practice this issue shouldn't get in the way anyway, since PIs aren't 
allowed in HTML.


&gt;<i> As long as website creators have the freedom to be sloppy
</I>
Authors don't have the freedom to be sloppy.


&gt;<i> why not go a little further to make XML compatibility better?
</I>
XML compatibility isn't a goal. There is a minor goal of making it 
possible to transition easily from XHTML to HTML. PI-like syntax in XHTML 
is only used for two purposes:

 - the XML declaration, which can simply be removed when publishing HTML, 
   and which if not removed will just be ignored (since it never contains 
   a &quot;&gt;&quot; character, so ending on the first &quot;&gt;&quot; is fine).

 - the XML Stylesheet PI, which needs to be converted to a &lt;link&gt; element 
   anyway, so isn't a problem.


&gt;<i> It'd be a whole lot more appealing to work in both environments out of 
</I>&gt;<i> the box than deal with complex server-side conversion solutions...
</I>
I don't really understand why you would ever use a PI to be honest.

Indeed.

This is actually just for implementation sanity, it's not about XML syntax 
compatibility.


&gt;<i> It seems to me that there should still be a role of eventually

</I>&gt;<i> language-neutral way (e.g., supporting a fuller subset of XML's features

</I>&gt;<i> which may also encourage or rely on using their own XML processing

</I>&gt;<i> standard behavior; and more harmonious and compatible with a simpler 
</I>&gt;<i> syntax (i.e., XML's)--even if the more complex syntax is more prominent 
</I>&gt;<i> and continues to be supported indefinitely.
</I>
People can use XML if they want, but I don't really see a path from 
today's HTML to a generic language that doesn't break backwards 
compatibility. If you're ok with breaking back-compat, though, there's no 
need to worry about HTML at all. Just use XHTML.
