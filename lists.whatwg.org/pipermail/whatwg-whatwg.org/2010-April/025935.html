</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think SRT is the right base format to start extending from.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That extension doesn't give us anything anyway, since no existing SRT

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do &quot;SRT + HTML + CSS&quot;, then we should start completely from a blank
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sympathetic to this sentiment.  SRT seems to be the simplest

</I>&gt;<i> other cases just feels like a potential win.  But it might not be,
</I>&gt;<i> sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Random brainstorm: we already had an element meant to mark up
</I>&gt;<i> dialogues, &lt;dialog&gt;.  Perhaps we can revive it, give it the minimal
</I>&gt;<i> extensions necessary to handle our use-cases, and use that for our
</I>&gt;<i> markup-heavy format?  Additional benefit: the element could then be
</I>&gt;<i> included directly in the page as well, as a transcript.

While I don't favor TTML, I also don't think that extending SRT is a great  
way forward, mostly because I don't see how to specify the language (which  
sometimes helps font selection), apply document-wide styling, reference  
external style sheets, use webfonts, etc...

I actually quite like the general idea behind Silvia's  
<A HREF="http://wiki.xiph.org/Timed_Divs_HTML">http://wiki.xiph.org/Timed_Divs_HTML</A>

This is somewhat similar to the &lt;timerange&gt; proposal that David Singer and  
Eric Carlson from Apple have brought up a few times.

No matter the syntax, the idea is basically to allow marking up certain  
parts of HTML as being relevant for certain time ranges. A CSS  
pseudo-selector matches the elements which are currently active, based on  
the current time of the media.

So, the external subtitle file could simply be HTML, with &lt;track&gt; acting  
much like an iframe with the only difference that the current time of the  
document is given by the embedding &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt;. Something like this:

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
...
&lt;timerange start=&quot;1&quot; end=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/timerange&gt;
&lt;timerange start=&quot;10&quot; end=&quot;12&quot;&gt;The End&lt;/timerange&gt;
...

The default stylesheet would be something like this:

:<i>before-timerange, :after-timerange {
</I>   display: none;
}
:<i>in-timerange {
</I>   display: block;
}

The styling issue is trivially solved, anything you can normally do is  
possible here too.

Pros:
  + Styling using CSS and only CSS.
  + Well known format to web authors and tools.
  + High reuse of existing implementations.
  + You could author CSS to make the HTML document read as a transcript  
when opened directly.
  + &lt;timerange&gt; reusable for page-embedded timed markup, which was the  
original idea.

Cons:
  - Politics.
  - New format for subtitle authors and tools.
  - Not usable outside the web platform (i.e. outside of web browsers).
  - &lt;timerange&gt; is a bit verbose, but that can be changed to whatever we  
want.

Thoughts?
