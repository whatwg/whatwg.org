I think that browser defaults should make sense when the page is rendered
Without author styles.  While authors often override this particular feature
, there they have the option to represent linked images in other ways such
as hover states, or more attractive borders etc.

Authors also often overwrite many other browser defaults such as font, 
styles for horizontal rules, often margins on paragraphs/headings/lists etc.
But it's probably not a good idea to set these things to zero.

At the end of the day, I've never found turning off borders much of a hassle
as an author.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also have to consider what is best for users. In theory, that would be

</I>&gt;<i> practice, our decision here doesn't affect users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This leads to the conclusion that resulted in the current spec text: the
