&gt;<i> Actually, if we try to &quot;implement&quot; the outlining algorithm in

</I>&gt;<i> third level we go nuts (the example is limited to &lt;section&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; elements, including all of them would yield a list of too
</I>&gt;<i> many selectors): &quot;section section h1, section article h1, article
</I>&gt;<i> section h1, article article h1&quot;. A four level would translate into 64
</I>&gt;<i> selectors or more (already quite insane to author), and if we ever
</I>&gt;<i> reach the fifth and further levels, we'll be dealing with hundreds or
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of selectors. If this isn't insane enough, keep in mind that
</I>&gt;<i> this is an over-simplification. Sure, there are combinations that will
</I>&gt;<i> never happen, but if we have to select also sub-headings inside a
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt; things get pretty funny.
</I>
Not true.  The CSSWG has a proposal (with unresolved issues, however)
for an :any() pseudoclass which works perfectly in this case:

:<i>any(section, nav, aside, article) h1 { foo }
</I>:<i>any(section, nav, aside, article) :any(section, nav, aside, article) h1 { bar }
</I>etc.

(In other words, the &quot;x&quot; selector in the spec is just the :any() selector here.)

Selecting for &lt;hgroup&gt;s is somewhat more difficult, but when you're
using &lt;hgroup&gt; you're probably doing something that you can throw your
own styling at.  At the very least, though, just treating &lt;hgroup&gt; as
&lt;h1&gt; in terms of styling would be fine.  Perhaps then throwing
additional styling at the sub-headings to shrink them appropriately,
like this:

:<i>any(section, nav, aside, artile) :any(h1, hgroup) { foo }
</I>...
hgroup &gt; h1 { font-size: 1em; }
hgroup &gt; h2 { font-size: .75em; }
hgroup &gt; h3 { font-size: .58em; }
...


&gt;<i> On the case of a mixed approach, it is *absolutely* impossible to get
</I>&gt;<i> the headings properly matched with current selector technology. Even
</I>&gt;<i> with jquery's :has() (many variants of which have been proposed
</I>&gt;<i> several times on the CSS discussion lists), things would be extremely
</I>&gt;<i> hard, if even possible at all.
</I>
Indeed, addressing heading level absolutely correctly from a purely
structural point of view is difficult and verbose.  But the heading
level itself is unambiguous and easy to determine, which is why a
:<i>heading(n) pseudoclass wouldn't be a difficult thing either.  But
</I>still, with just the :any() pseudoclass, it's not terribly verbose to
get a good &quot;close enough&quot; approach that should work well enough as a
default.


&gt;<i> So, that's enough of a problem statement (at least for now). My
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion is to clean things a bit: consolidate the sectioning model
</I>&gt;<i> into a single element+attribute pair, like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt; stays as is.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;nav&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;aside&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt; becomes &lt;section kind=&quot;address&quot;&gt; (and the former is defined
</I>&gt;<i> in the compatibility section as equivalent to the later, because it is
</I>&gt;<i> the only element of the sectioning model that already exists in
</I>&gt;<i> previous versions of HTML).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure about what should be done with &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt;, but I hope this is a good place to discuss it ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any UA would have exactly the same amount of information within the
</I>&gt;<i> element, so the outlining algorithm could be perfectly implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This yields several advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The styling issue improves drastically: any pre-HTML5 will
</I>&gt;<i> understand this (IE would require a bit of javascript anyway) out of
</I>&gt;<i> the box:
</I>&gt;<i> h1 { styling for top-level }
</I>&gt;<i> section h1 { styling for second-level }
</I>&gt;<i> section section h1 { styling for third-level }
</I>&gt;<i> and so on, for as many levels as you need.
</I>
Fixing HTML because CSS is too difficult probably isn't the right
solution.  Address the problem at the source - CSS needs to be able to
handle this case well.  Luckily there are further similar use-cases
that make solving this problem fairly attractive.


&gt;<i> 2) All of a sudden, something like &lt;section kind=&quot;aside nav&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;See
</I>&gt;<i> also&lt;/h1&gt; some indirectly related links here...&lt;/section&gt; becomes
</I>&gt;<i> possible, plus easy to style, and works happily with the outlining
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm.
</I>
What's the benefit of marking something as both an &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;nav&gt;?


&gt;<i> 3) Future needs will become easier to solve on future versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> specification, and with significantly smaller costs: for example,
</I>&gt;<i> let's assume a new sectioning element such as &lt;attachment&gt; becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> widespread need (it would already make sense on sites like web-mail
</I>&gt;<i> services, discussion boards, bug-trackers, and some others...). So a
</I>&gt;<i> new crouton on the soup, which would be treated quite like a generic
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt; by pre-HTML6 (or 7, or whatever) browsers. Now, with the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;+attribute approach, we'd get something like &lt;section
</I>&gt;<i> kind=&quot;attachment&quot;&gt;: that'd would still work with the outlining
</I>&gt;<i> algoryth (it could be treated as generic section), it's styling will
</I>&gt;<i> work smoothly, etc.
</I>
What's the problem with just &lt;attachment&gt;?  Styling is easy to update.
