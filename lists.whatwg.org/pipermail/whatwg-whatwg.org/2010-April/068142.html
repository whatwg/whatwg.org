</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. &#8220;That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;ll just use the XYZ JavaScript encryption library.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. &#8220;And then use it on every read and every write?&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. &#8220;Ugh, you&#8217;re right, nevermind.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Presumably the &quot;ugh&quot; is a reaction to the perceived slowness of doing
the crypto in JS? Has anyone
benchmarked JS crypto performance compared to what the imagined C/C++
perf would be?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve had, or participated in, this conversation multiple times. I also know,
</I>&gt;<i> from speaking with others about this proposal, that this conversation isn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> uncommon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m all for adding crypto into JavaScript. I think in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to that, there should be affordances for what will likely be common
</I>&gt;<i> usage patterns. To me, any and all mechanisms for client-side storage should
</I>&gt;<i> have some basic crypto built-in, so why not start here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In regards to data expiration, part of ensuring the security of data is
</I>&gt;<i> knowing how long it will be stored on disk. If I let someone borrow my
</I>&gt;<i> computer to check their email, and the email client happens to save some
</I>&gt;<i> data onto the client, then that person&#8217;s data will now be on my disk for who
</I>&gt;<i> knows how long. That represents a data security issue. By allowing an
</I>&gt;<i> expiration date to be tied to the data, you can have reasonable assurance
</I>&gt;<i> that the data isn&#8217;t just going to be sitting around waiting for someone to
</I>&gt;<i> try and use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is true that not having control over your data could be an issue, but simply
embedding expiry into the data may not buy you much to protect it. Insofar
as the crypto wouldn't be running in a TPM, it would be easy to reverse engineer
it and extract the data; it would also be fairly easy to reset the
clock on the device
to keep data from being deleted.

I continue to think that the requirements for a secure storage API
that fit a wide
range of use cases are not particularly clear (and it would be easy to see this
balloon into a wide API designed for lots of different corner cases).
I think the ideal
approach for this would be to build a JS-based implementation on top
of the existing
libraries and, if such a library sees wide adoption, push for it to be
implemented natively.

If there are fundamental missing primitives, then by all means we
should look at adding
them, but I'm not sure that we are missing anything.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that Dirk is right that crypto in the browser is a more

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> My proposal is less about encryption and more about providing better control

</I>&gt;<i> Can you provide some concrete use cases for expiration of content? &#160;They'd

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, that's precisely what I'm talking about. It seems to me that this

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The idea behind letting the key to be defined by the developer is to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any usage that developers deem appropriate for the situation. For example,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one might want to only use a server-generated key to access the data, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which case this data won't be available offline but will be used to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supplement the online behavior. Another might determine the key based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some information in a cookie, which is less secure but does allow offline
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access while also ensuring that if the cookie changes or is deleted, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data remains secure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The idea behind the expiration date is to allow developers to be sure the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data won't stay around on disk indefinitely. Think about the Internet caf&#233;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use case where people are repeatedly logging in and out - we don't want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone's data living on that computer for however many years it's in use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One way or another, I think JavaScript crypto is going to be important in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the next few years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we should instead focus on a set of JS Crypto APIs, since that
</I>&gt;<i> is largely orthogonal to the storage APIs?
