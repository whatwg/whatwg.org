A point that Ian also noted was where styles were turned off, or the
page was viewed in a browser not capable of displaying styles. Yes
they're rare, but they do exist. As he said, it's not a huge effort to
turn them off in a stylesheet, and is often just one of many things
people 'reset' along with table cell padding, header margins, font
sizes, etc. These are among the most often styles that I see people
typically change, and it's usually the same kinds of changes. Should the
browsers all change their behaviour to follow what is the trend of
styling now, or remain historically consistent and let the developers do
a little more legwork.

There is another side to this as well: what bandwidth impact might this
have if stylesheets online didn't have to consistently change the
default behaviour for popular elements?

Thanks,
Ash
