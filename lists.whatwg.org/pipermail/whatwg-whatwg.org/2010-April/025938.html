Would you call SRT a native Web format, too? Are RSS and ATOM native
Web formats?


&gt;<i> No matter if the implementation behind the scenes

CSS is much tighter linked to HTML than a timed text format. If your
UA happens to not support TTML, only one feature will be missing, i.e.
timed text on your video. That doesn't destroy your Web page. But lack
of CSS support does.


&gt;<i> I really do hate to come up with a new format. But I think TTML is
</I>&gt;<i> severely off the mark for what we want. Am I wrong in that marking up
</I>&gt;<i> dialogue vs. sound effects vs. narrator vs. descriptions is important?
</I>&gt;<i> Or at least more useful than for example the ability to set the text
</I>&gt;<i> outline blur radius?
</I>
I don't think your requirement is off the mark. I think it is
something that current caption formats don't do, since there hasn't
been a need and nobody has really looked at them from a Web
background. Therefore it wasn't included in TTML. I also have multiple
requirements that are not satisfied by TTML. I was under the
impression that we can fix up TTML with such extensions. But if people
prefer to develop a new format, that's fine by me.

That doesn't mean though that we can ignore TTML. For what it has been
developed - for use in captions in all sorts of environment, which
include for example digital TV and mobile devices - it has been good
and its use is spreading.


Cheers,
Silvia.
