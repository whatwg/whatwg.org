&quot;Best effort&quot; mapping won't be enough as soon as this gets really
picks up.  Authors can be crazy about the placement of things.  We'll
end up having to define the exact mapping, or else have compat bugs on
all the browsers.


&gt;<i> A spec would need to be written for this new extended SRT format.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if we are introducing HTML markup inside SRT time cues, then it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think SRT is the right base format to start extending from.
</I>&gt;<i> That extension doesn't give us anything anyway, since no existing SRT

</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>
I'm sympathetic to this sentiment.  SRT seems to be the simplest
widespread format that would &quot;just work&quot;, so extending it for the
other cases just feels like a potential win.  But it might not be,
sure.

Random brainstorm: we already had an element meant to mark up
dialogues, &lt;dialog&gt;.  Perhaps we can revive it, give it the minimal
extensions necessary to handle our use-cases, and use that for our
markup-heavy format?  Additional benefit: the element could then be
included directly in the page as well, as a transcript.
