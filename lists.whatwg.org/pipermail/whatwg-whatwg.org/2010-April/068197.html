I believe it is possible today, but of course cannot prove it right
now. Also, future evolution of TTML will be directed by the Web in the
future if it gets integrated, as it would be its main use. Also: it's
a W3C standard, so probably would have the requirement not to break
the Web. So, I don't buy that latter argument. But I guess until there
is a mapping for all of DFXP, there probably aren't enough facts to
support/reject DFXP.


&gt;<i> We could make that problem go away by normatively defining something that

I personally have no issue with introducing a new format - even
experimented with one some time ago, see
<A HREF="http://wiki.xiph.org/Timed_Divs_HTML">http://wiki.xiph.org/Timed_Divs_HTML</A> . There are challenges with this,
too, and they are not only political. For example, I think we would
need to restrict some things from appearing in timed sections: e.g.
would we really want to allow multiple layers of video rendered on top
of video? But we could develop a new format - just like we have
developed microdata.

Introducing a new format would indeed be mainly a political problem.
Not just would it go &quot;against&quot; all other existing formats. It would
also be a challenge to get other applications to support it, in
particular applications that do not contain a Web framework.

Thus, my thinking was that what we do internally is basically HTML+CSS
on time sections. And all formats that we read from externally will be
mapped to that. We would already do that with SRT, too.

Cheers,
Silvia.
