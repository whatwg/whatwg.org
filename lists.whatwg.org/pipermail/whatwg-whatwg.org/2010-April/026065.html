<PRE>Hi Rob, all,

Fair enough :-) I'll have to try better. Rob you give some good examples
(WebGL and CSS3) of how an application could be built which correctly
renders two views with stereopsis. However, with the exception of Anaglyph
methods, a user will need specialised display hardware to properly view the
image. So, to clarify, the issue is not the rendering of the stereo views
(I'll worry about that later) but rather how those views are targeted to the
correct virtual display (for example by alternating the left and right views
on odd and even frames). If we take the case of the Blu-Ray 3D specification
it is neutral about how the hardware is implemented, but the hardware is
expected to respect the flags indicating whether a frame is for the left or
right virtual display. In order to work with HTML the UA has to have some
awareness of the hardware and way of signalling with view is for which
virtual display. My question is, how can this be done in a consistent
manner? Given that this usually requires some hardware control, is a good
approach to use the &lt;device&gt; element?

I hope this is a little clearer.

Best regards,

Eoin.
