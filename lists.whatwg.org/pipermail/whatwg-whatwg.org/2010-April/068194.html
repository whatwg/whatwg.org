I don't fully agree. For example we don't expose DOM Nodes to workers
because several browsers do not have thread safe DOM implementations.
Despite the fact that this is an implementation detail.

Similarly, while localStorage is easy to implement as specified on
single process implementations, it turns out to be a disaster on
multiprocess implementations such as IE8 and Chrome. If we had known
about this earlier we for sure would have adjusted localStorages API.
Despite the fact that this is due to an implementation detail.

I generally agree that implementation details should come second to
what makes a useful API. However if something is hard to impossible to
implement on certain classes of implementations, then we need to take
that into account. Especially when it seems like browsers are
generally moving towards those classes (in this case, multithreaded
audio/video).

That said, I'm not sure if we need to make such adjustments here. But
since I'm not sure I wanted to raise the issue.
