How about putting some text at the end of Section 9.2.3, &quot;Posting
Messages&quot; that says something like:

&quot;Note that messages are not guaranteed to be delivered reliably under
all circumstances. User agents are allowed to not deliver messages if
the details of their implementation may make this difficult or
impossible to do safely and securely. For example, if a new child
window is created and then a message is immediately posted to it, that
message may not get delivered, even if the child window belongs to the
same origin. A rationale for this may me that it would require the
user agent to queue the message across creation of a new event loop,
leading to all sorts of unpredictable timing issues.&quot;

I'm not particularly happy with the wording here, but it gets the
point across. Of course, putting in text like this would naturally
lead the reader to wonder under what conditions messages *are*
guaranteed to be delivered reliably. Which is, I think, a valid
question I don't know the answer to. Is it safe to say that messages
are delivered reliably if the destination window belongs to the
specified targetOrigin and the destination window is fully loaded?
What if a navigation event is triggered on the destination window?
