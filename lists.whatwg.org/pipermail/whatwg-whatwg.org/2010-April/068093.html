<PRE>Sorry for misunderstanding your original suggestion.

It seems to me that Dirk is right that crypto in the browser is a more
general problem and that a general crypto API would be much more valuable
than creating new APIs with similar/duplicate functionality + crypto.
 Optimizing for &quot;repeated patterns&quot; probably should wait until we see what
patterns are actually common.  :-)


&gt;<i> My proposal is less about encryption and more about providing better

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can you provide some concrete use cases for expiration of content?  They'd
probably have to be pretty dramatic to warrant creating yet another storage
mechanism.

Maybe this can somehow be integrated into IndexedDB?  There's very little
chance of it being a v1 feature, but maybe we could make sure it's possible
to add in future versions.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea behind letting the key to be defined by the developer is to

</I>&gt;<i> some information in a cookie, which is less secure but does allow offline
</I>&gt;<i> access while also ensuring that if the cookie changes or is deleted, the
</I>&gt;<i> data remains secure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea behind the expiration date is to allow developers to be sure the

</I>&gt;<i> everyone's data living on that computer for however many years it's in use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One way or another, I think JavaScript crypto is going to be important in

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we should instead focus on a set of JS Crypto APIs, since that
