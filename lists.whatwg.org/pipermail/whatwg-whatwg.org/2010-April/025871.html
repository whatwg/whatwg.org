(There was a subthread investigating making this a quirks-mode feature, 
but there's no evidence that it's needed for compatibility, so I haven't 
quoted that above.)

Personally, my opinion is that images in links should have borders because 
otherwise how do you know it's a link?

This seems to be a minority view, though. People have been explicitly 
turning off this cue for literally over a decade.

Generally for things like this the spec just does whatever is needed for 
optimal compatibility with existing content. In this case, whoever, pages 
don't by and large depend on one behaviour or the other, since there have 
been browsers with significant market share on both sides of this issue 
for a long time.

If compatibility isn't a factor here, and it doesn't appear to be, then 
we have to consider what provides the least work for authors. This appears 
to be having no border, since that is what most authors seem to gravitate 
towards.

We also have to consider what is best for users. In theory, that would be 
to have the border -- but since so many authors disable the border, in 
practice, our decision here doesn't affect users.

This leads to the conclusion that resulted in the current spec text: the 
only major factor here is author convenience, and that argues for no 
border by default.
