Dates outside the near past and near future really aren't in any of the 
use cases for date types in HTML5 so far.

For far away dates, use cases almost always end up being far more 
complicated, requiring things like range support, vague date support (e.g. 
just the month and year, or just the year, or a range of days in a month 
and year), explicit calendar support, etc.

So supporting those dates really isn't a problem that we need to solve, at 
least as far as addressing the use cases put forth so far.

Note that supporting old dates gets especially dicey given that calendars 
changed to the Gregorian calendar at different dates in different 
countries, so you have to include geographic information as well to 
convert old dates into Gregorian-equivalent dates. This is really an area 
of complexity that we do not want to specify in HTML5.

Right.

Neither of these would likely use type=date. Timelines probably would 
rather use logarithmic year selectors (e.g. using type=range), and virtual 
skies for dates far away will typically use Julian dates (which are more 
like type=number step=any).

Genealogy's use of dates is far, far more complex and involved for old 
dates than anything type=date can do.

I agree with all these points.

It does seem somewhat unlikely that any of this will still be relevant in 
7000 years.

But with type=date? Really?

No, we don't have to predict. But we only have to design the language to 
handle the cases that we think are important.

I'm not convinced.

What would be helpful is examples of existing pages that use input 
controls that deal with dates that are not currently handled by the date 
time format in HTML5. That would help us determine what we actually need.

I don't see a benefit here to blind adherence to 8601. The 8601 format is 
hard to read, allowing whitespace gets around this with very little change 
to the parsing requirements.
