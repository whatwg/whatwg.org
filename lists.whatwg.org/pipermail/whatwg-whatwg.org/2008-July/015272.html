</I>
Actually MEDIA_ERR_DECODE will only fire if the advertised codec is 
supported but the media stream doesn't use it.

If none of the advertised codecs are supported, then load() will fire 
INVALID_STATE_ERR.

Anyway, the net effect is that you can already tell if any of the 
advertised codecs are supported.

Since the goal is to just have one codec, I don't want to add new stuff 
just to handle the case where the codec isn't supported.

I'm happy to use whatever implementors want to use. So far MIME types have 
been what has been suggested.
