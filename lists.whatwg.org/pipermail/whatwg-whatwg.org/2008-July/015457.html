<PRE>The situation is a lot better for archives (like MPEG-21 files) that 
have a directory at the front...

</I>&gt;<i>I don't think it is as much of a performance killer as you say it 
</I>&gt;<i>is. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the standard connection limit is 
</I>&gt;<i>two. It is not as though every external file could be loaded at 
</I>&gt;<i>once. Additionally, as I said, you could split resources into 
</I>&gt;<i>multiple archives to take advantage of multiple connections, because 
</I>&gt;<i>they can be loaded asynchronously without issue.  Remember, the use 
</I>&gt;<i>case for this would be when there are likely dozens of different 
</I>&gt;<i>files that need to be loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So you get nondeterministic load behaviour anyway. This is not good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is not so different than directly requesting a file from 
</I>&gt;<i>multiple tabs. Let's say page 1 and page 2 each use the same image. 
</I>&gt;<i>If I load page 2 first, it will go directly to the server. If I load 
</I>&gt;<i>page 1 first, page 2 will get the image from cache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Clearly, there are other ways of performing this task, but I think 
</I>&gt;<i>this way is simple and I know that I would gladly accept it as a 
</I>&gt;<i>possibility. It falls within the same realm that any caching 
</I>&gt;<i>behavior does. It is meant purely for performance, but if you are 
</I>&gt;<i>relying on it for a given behavior then you are on a road to trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The archived resources should be static, and also available as 
</I>&gt;<i>individual files. Pre-fetching them should only be used for 
</I>&gt;<i>performance gains, and if it would not be performant, it should not 
</I>&gt;<i>be used. However, I think there is a fairly wide range of sites or 
</I>&gt;<i>applications that could benefit from this feature. If there are 
</I>&gt;<i>other ways of improving it, or making it work better for certain 
</I>&gt;<i>edge cases, that would be great, but don't throw the baby out with 
</I>&gt;<i>the bath water.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Off the top of my head, I can think of a couple of ways to refine 
</I>&gt;<i>the feature and deal with the issues raised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Only blocking the loading of files that could logically be inside 
</I>&gt;<i>the archive: if the archive is located at &quot;/js/resources.zip&quot;, then 
</I>&gt;<i>the only files that should be blocked would have to be located under 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;/js&quot;. &lt;img src=&quot;/images/lolcat.jpg&quot;/&gt; would not be blocked.
</I>&gt;<i>To go a step further, there could even be some kind of &quot;pattern&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>attribute that would block the loading of files that matched a url 
</I>&gt;<i>pattern. For example, if the archive were located at &quot;/&quot;, but had a 
</I>&gt;<i>pattern of &quot;**.js,**.css,/images/*&quot;, only js, css, and files under 
</I>&gt;<i>the &quot;/images&quot; directory would be blocked.

</I>&gt;<i>Yes, the one major hang up that I foresee is how a browser should 
</I>&gt;<i>handle asynchronous loading. How would it know the contents of the 
</I>&gt;<i>archive before it loaded the archive so it did not try to load the 
</I>&gt;<i>same files directly? The simple answer would be to load the 
</I>&gt;<i>archive(s) synchronously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That is a performance killer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for references in a different tab, if the separate tab/document 
</I>&gt;<i>did not reference the zip archive first, it would operate as normal. 
</I>&gt;<i>It would check the cache and then attempt to load. If the zip had 
</I>&gt;<i>been loaded from the first page already, the file would be present 
</I>&gt;<i>in the cache, and if not, then the browser would attempt to retrieve 
</I>&gt;<i>it from the server.
