Suppose it was called &quot;archive:&quot; instead of &quot;jar:&quot; and the spec was made
open-ended so that other archive types other than ZIP files were permitted.
Would your objection still apply?


&gt;<i> Anyway, it is not obvious at all that linking inside a packaged HTML

Multiple entry points to a single application are common.

&quot;He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are
healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
53:5-6]
