Not sure I agree. Your line of reasoning in general leads to a 
proliferation of elements, whereas my proposal to extend &lt;audio&gt; makes 
that same element more powerful. I guess it's more a matter of 
aesthetics which approach is better.

&gt;<i> It's an interesting idea, but you'd have to answer 'what are your

I agree and I think I pointed that out already in my initial posting.

&gt;<i> I'm guessing that something like MIDI would be drawing primitives, but 
</I>&gt;<i> overall this idea would seem to need a lot of working out...
</I>
Again in that initial posting I was quite specific about an initial set 
of 'drawing' primitives - audio-manipulation primitives -, minimally

get/setSample(&lt;samplePoint&gt; t, &lt;sampleValue&gt; v, &lt;channel&gt; c).

For the sketched use case - in-browser audio editor -, functions on 
sample regions from {cut/add silence/amplify/fade} would be nice and 
were mentioned as an extended possibility, but that is optional.

I don't understand the reference to MIDI, because my use case has no 
connection to musical notes, it's about arbitrary audio data on which 
MIDI has nothing to say.
