No.  The definition *for MPEG-21 files* (which is all I have 
specified so far) is that accesses to the matching absolute URL (or 
relative URL) from within the archibe MUST find the resource within 
the archive.  Since, as I say, this format starts with a directory, 
you know whether you have it or not.  If ZIP or JAR files don't have 
a directory, then yes, they have a different trade-off and must load 
the whole thing before they know.

You only need a resource *outside* the archive if it is requested 
'nakedly' from outside the archive.  If you do that, it might indeed 
hurt, but that's your choice as a site.

The performance trade-off is very simple;  if you have many small 
resources it may be much more efficient to ftch them as a package 
than individually.  The downside is that this is a single connection 
in a pre-defined order whereas multiple resources could be fetched on 
parallel connections, and as needed.  I doubt more connections to the 
same server gets you more bandwidth, however, and the mpeg-21 format 
also allows extent-based interleaving so that e.g. a lareg HTML page 
and and large JPEG can be loaded progressively together.

&gt;<i>And if those copies ever get out of sync you're in very big trouble, 
</I>&gt;<i>because depending on the context, either the archive version or the
