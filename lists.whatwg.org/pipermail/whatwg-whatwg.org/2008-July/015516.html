<PRE>
&lt;figure&gt; was changed some time back to allow any content and to allow the 
legend to be omitted. At the time this was done as part of a content model 
overhaul and so I forgot to respond to some of the &lt;figure&gt; feedback. (I 
haven't quoted most of the feedback asking for this below, since many of 
the same points were made several times.)

Done.

It's not valid.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;caption&gt;.
</I>
I haven't added &lt;credit&gt; yet... I'd rather see how &lt;figure&gt; fares as is 
before adding more stuff.

</I>
Yeah, that might make sense, even. Right now the content model allows it, 
so long as the &lt;legend&gt; comes last (or first), so feel free to experiment 
with this.

&lt;footer&gt; could work too, to some extent. I mean, it's not right per spec 
now, but if people experiment with it I'd be interested in hearing of the 
results, they wouldn't certainly influence how the spec develops.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think a separate element for credit would be great. The caption 
</I>&gt;<i> and credit are functionally different. A caption tells the reader why an 
</I>&gt;<i> image has been included in the page; a credit tells where it came from.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've done a quick survey this morning of magazines and textbooks around 
</I>&gt;<i> the office, and confirmed my suspicion that typically, caption and 
</I>&gt;<i> credit are displayed and styled separately. I think they would be more 
</I>&gt;<i> often separated on the web if average web design was as careful and 
</I>&gt;<i> competent as average print design. They look the same on the Guardian's 
</I>&gt;<i> website, but most often, the caption is small sans-serif text placed 
</I>&gt;<i> directly under or beside the photo with little margin, and the caption 
</I>&gt;<i> is in larger text slightly farther below the image. If the credit is in 
</I>&gt;<i> the same visual block with the caption, it's often presented in a 
</I>&gt;<i> different font. The photo on this page, rather unfortunately, shows both 
</I>&gt;<i> designs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6545249">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6545249</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, styling doesn't determine semantics, but if the design is 
</I>&gt;<i> thoughtful styling does reflect semantics, and the stylistic conventions 
</I>&gt;<i> help readers to process the caption and credit separately as they read. 
</I>&gt;<i> If practical, the same assistance ought to be available to non-sighted 
</I>&gt;<i> readers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When there are several images on a page, an author might wish to put all 
</I>&gt;<i> of the photo credits at the bottom so as not to clutter up the 
</I>&gt;<i> presentation unduly, but if the credit were a separate element, that 
</I>&gt;<i> could be done with scripting while leaving the semantics intact.
</I>
Thanks for this research. (The page above seems to have changed, sadly.)


&gt;<i> Would the credit element, whatever it is called, be block or inline? 
</I>&gt;<i> Semantically I don't believe it makes much difference. I suppose I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> recommend that it be an inline element inside the &lt;legend&gt;, because then 
</I>&gt;<i> with CSS I could declare it to be display: block and pull it out, 
</I>&gt;<i> whereas if it's a block-level element, there's no easy way to put it 
</I>&gt;<i> back inside the legend.
</I>
Interesting idea. Having it be inline in the legend would kind of make 
sense, indeed. If people want to experiment with that, I recommend using 
&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; and letting me know how that works out.

</I>
That makes sense to me, yes.

Experimenting with putting credit information in the image title=&quot;&quot; 
attribute would be another area from which we could learn valuable lessons 
about how we should move forward with this.

True enough, though in the case of figures, I think the semantics are 
still pretty clear, and the class attribute can be used to narrow it 
further (e.g. for books that want to list &quot;charts&quot; and &quot;tables&quot; and 
&quot;images&quot; in separate indexes).
