We have &lt;img&gt; for this already.

0.2%. More common than &lt;abbr&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;dfn&gt;, &lt;kbd&gt;, &lt;ins&gt;, &lt;var&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, 
&lt;samp&gt;, etc...

1 and 3 are non-issues, sorry.

2 is already handled by &lt;object&gt; when you need it.


&gt;<i> &gt; If you need markup in the fallback, use &lt;object&gt;. (Or, better, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider exposing the content to everyone and not making it only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available to those who don't see the image.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The point of fallback is &#145;help for people who can't see the image&#146; 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than &#145;an explanation of the image suitable for all&#146;. Of course, 
</I>&gt;<i> if you can provide the latter, that's great, and there's no problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> Fallback content could be as simple as &quot;Figure 2&quot;, where the surrounding 
</I>&gt;<i> text discusses the image sufficiently that it isn't necessary to see the 
</I>&gt;<i> image, but users still want to know which image element on the page that 
</I>&gt;<i> text was referring to (so they can download it to disk, or whatever).
</I>
My point is that the alternative text (the fallback) will often be useful 
for everyone, not just those who can't see the image. But that if you 
really don't want people to see both, you can use &lt;object&gt; anyway.


&gt;<i> Aye, but &lt;img&gt; gets me very angry.
</I>
With all due respect, this may be more a problem for you than for the 
language. :-)


The spelling of the tag is not a real problem. The lack of rich fallback 
isn't a problem at all, since we have &lt;object&gt;.

I don't really see any issue here.
