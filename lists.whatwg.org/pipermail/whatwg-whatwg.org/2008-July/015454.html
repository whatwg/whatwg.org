As far as I know there are no non-symmetric Window visibility cases in 
HTML5. You can only postMessage() to a Window if the Window can see you. 
Is that not true?

Anyway, getting a hold of a Window and setting its window.location.href 
are two different things, as noted below.

The idea is that message channels are the solution around this, by the 
way -- you sent a port to a window you have access to (and that has 
access to you) and if it passes it on to a window you _don't_ have access 
to, it can't navigate you.

Yes and no -- location.href only allows navigation if a separate access 
check passes (not the same-origin check).


Adam explains it well:

Right. This is defined here:

We can't remove window.source, that's how you talk back. :-)


&gt;<i> For example, consider
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> w=window.open();
</I>&gt;<i> w.opener = null;
</I>&gt;<i> w.location = '<A HREF="http://untrusted.example.org'">http://untrusted.example.org'</A>
</I>&gt;<i> w.postMessage( '...' );
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Untrusted content now gets a window reference it would not otherwise 
</I>&gt;<i> have, and will be allowed to set location if this scripts runs in the 
</I>&gt;<i> top context of the opener.
</I>
If the top-level location changes, the location bar will change too, and 
after that the pages can't communication usefully (all you can do is a 
phishing attack, but then the evil page could just as easily just open a 
new window and hope the user doesn't realise there are two windows open, 
it would have the same effect -- or just redirect its own window to the 
phishing window, or whatever).

If this is really a concern, then use the &lt;iframe sandbox&gt; option. The 
sandboxed navigation browsing context flag will then take care of 
preventing any undue navigation.

This is already the case, since there's no way to get a hold of a Window 
object from another unit.


&gt;<i> In addition, we could define a new target, for example &quot;_unrelated&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> such that calling
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> window.open(url, &quot;_unrelated&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would open the URL in a new unit of related browsing contexts.
</I>
&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt; basically does this per spec today.

I don't want to do it for window.open() because window.open() in legacy 
UAs always returns a Window object, which would defeat the point.

The point is that you can't distinguish changing a top-level frame from 
just opening a brand new top-level frame, so it's not really gaining you 
anything. The &quot;sandbox&quot; feature of &lt;iframe&gt; in HTML5 deals with this.


&gt;<i> That said, I think a reply() method might be a better idea than a source

</I>&gt;<i> generically, but I guess source had that problem already for server-sent 
</I>&gt;<i> events.  Do note it's more spec burden due to determining sender 
</I>&gt;<i> identity (could be mitigated by equating reply with calling postMessage 
</I>&gt;<i> on the proposed-hidden source property); dynamic scope-dependent 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior is no fun that way.
</I>
I'm a little concerned about adding methods to the Event object, there 
isn't any precedent for that really. I'm also not convinced the attack 
scenario is really a problem.
