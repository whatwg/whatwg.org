<PRE>
Over the years a number of e-mails have been sent to the list about 
signatures and other public key cryptography topics, most of which are 
quoted below.

For a number of reasons, not least of which my lack of expertise in the 
area, the size of the HTML5 spec today, and the low level of demand for 
these features, I have decided to not cover this topic in HTML5, and 
instead rely on other groups to define these features.

I include a representative sampling of the e-mails sent to the WHATWG on 
the topic below, so that if anyone wishes to work on this topic, they can 
use this feedback. I encourage people interested in this topic to approach 
the IETF, where work on these issues has historically taken place.

</I>&gt;<i> As you said, we may not get sufficient informations to standardize

</I>&gt;<i> The spec. and interface are almost standardized by governmental rules to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In Korea, the own cryptic algorithm has been encouraged, so vendors 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't use browser-implemented things such as DES. This is first 
</I>&gt;<i> reason to use activex controls.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second is for digital signature. Legally, all data must be signed by 
</I>&gt;<i> user's key. When the money is sent, it needs to know who sends the 
</I>&gt;<i> money. So activex control has almost same user interface with browser's 
</I>&gt;<i> certificate manager.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When an user enters an internet banking site, activex are embedded. 
</I>&gt;<i> User's data by action go to activex control and are encrypted by SEED 
</I>&gt;<i> and signed by user's key. Encrypted and signed data gives hidden form in 
</I>&gt;<i> web page again. When an user submit it, the data were transferred to web 
</I>&gt;<i> server. The server-side application decrypts and verifies the data and 
</I>&gt;<i> proceeds proper actions. Web server transfers the web page by requested 
</I>&gt;<i> actions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First thing is not standardized. National algorithm such as SEED or 
</I>&gt;<i> Camella is problems between browser vendor and its governments. Second 
</I>&gt;<i> can be done such as (re)issue and revocation of personal certificates, 
</I>&gt;<i> the digital signature such as old crypto.sign.Text().

</I>&gt;<i> your issuing and great jobs. But, we can simply think this issue in 
</I>&gt;<i> range of this group. Most of forms directly go to web server via 
</I>&gt;<i> urlencoded. If some indicators are given, browsers can execute signing 
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;form name=&quot;sendmoney&quot; action=&quot;/send.cgi&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot; value=&quot;3.00&quot;&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;submt&quot; value=&quot;Sending Money!&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When an user clicks submit button, the dialog box will be opened for 
</I>&gt;<i> selecting the private certificates to be signed. Server can understand 
</I>&gt;<i> form data and attached signatures signed by browser via SSL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or it can be applied each forms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot; value=&quot;3.00&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway it is browser's the function of digital signature such as 
</I>&gt;<i> sign.Text() function. This idea make possible to handle easily them via 
</I>&gt;<i> form.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> May I try to explain how I look on web-forms and digital signatures?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most people indeed come up with schemes like the one you described 
</I>&gt;<i> because it seems so obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I work with a different concept which is not really form-oriented, but 
</I>&gt;<i> rather view-oriented.  This is borrowed from what most e-commerce sites 
</I>&gt;<i> use today.  First you create an order using arbitrary web methods 
</I>&gt;<i> including &lt;form&gt;.  Then you typically input credit card data etc.  
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually you are faced with a consolidate/aggregated purchase 
</I>&gt;<i> transaction request which typically is just an HTML page with *static* 
</I>&gt;<i> information plus an &quot;OK&quot; button.  When you hit OK, you do not send the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML page, only an acknowledge of the request you had on the screen.  
</I>&gt;<i> Now, how does this map into digital signatures? The basic difference 
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to the OK button is that the returned result contains a 
</I>&gt;<i> signature over the view.  The actual (internal) transaction data is 
</I>&gt;<i> typically not signed since it is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - already is known in advance by the server otherwise
</I>&gt;<i>   it wouldn't have been able to create a view to the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - may not have any visual representation at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's more, the service also does its own calculation of message 
</I>&gt;<i> digests of the transaction request view and is thus able to immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> verify not only the signatures validity but that the user actually had 
</I>&gt;<i> the proper content in his/her browser.  The signature is subsequently 
</I>&gt;<i> stored close to the real transaction record for supporting unlikely (but 
</I>&gt;<i> possible), future dispute resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is an inherent problem with your suggested form:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;form name=&quot;sendmoney&quot; action=&quot;/send.cgi&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot; value=&quot;3.00&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;account&quot; values=&quot;1234567890&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;submt&quot; value=&quot;Sending Money!&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> because in a real-world case it would probably read:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;form name=&quot;sendmoney&quot; action=&quot;/send.cgi&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;account&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;submt&quot; value=&quot;Sending Money!&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which means that you sign data that has not first passed a server's 
</I>&gt;<i> validation.  Although XForms can do validation, I doubt XForms are 
</I>&gt;<i> suitable for anything but simple applications. Server-based validation 
</I>&gt;<i> can also cope with transactional issues that XF can't like bookings.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also I wonder what you meant should be sent to the server. The signed 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes only?  I think this is a half-baked idea since the rest of 
</I>&gt;<i> the document may contain important data that could affect the user's 
</I>&gt;<i> decision to sign th data.  The &quot;fine print&quot; for example :-) If you sign 
</I>&gt;<i> a house contract you don't sign the sales value but a lot of text and 
</I>&gt;<i> conditions.  Digital signatures should IMHO afhere to this notion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In case there would be embedded objects like CSS or IMG in the HTML page 
</I>&gt;<i> holding the &lt;form&gt; they should also in some way be signed?  Now we have 
</I>&gt;<i> a brand new format: Signed HTML. WASP does not need any specific signed 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML because its method is a bit like S/MIME although in XML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to that there are some cryptographic stuff that needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> addressed which makes the rather innocent &quot;signed&quot; attribute grow quite 
</I>&gt;<i> a bit.  If you look on the WASP CertificateFilter it is a good example 
</I>&gt;<i> of how complex it can be to sign.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We also need an attachment feature.  It is a bit unclear how that could 
</I>&gt;<i> be met with a &lt;form&gt; based approach unless all input is done in a single 
</I>&gt;<i> form which would be very constraining.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To not be stuck with HTML but also allow MS office, PDF Open Document we 
</I>&gt;<i> also need some other mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is at least how WASP was conceived
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In case you have an example of a Korean HTML signature, I would be happy 
</I>&gt;<i> to get a copy.
