</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So again, I ask for an &lt;image&gt; element to replace &lt;img&gt;. Benefits include:

</I>
I don't see how this is a benefit over &lt;img&gt;.


&gt;<i> - The alt and longdesc attributes can be part of the fallback content,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing markup.
</I>
If you need markup in the fallback, use &lt;object&gt;. (Or, better, consider 
exposing the content to everyone and not making it only available to those 
who don't see the image.)


&gt;<i> - You don't have to provide a type attribute and match on: object
</I>&gt;<i> [type^=&quot;image/&quot;]
</I>
Seems like &quot;img&quot; handles this too.

</I>
We're not doing any DOCTYPE-based parsing differences unless we 
_absolutely_ have to. This kind of switch is a giant source of 
implementation bugs and authoring problems.

I don't see why it would (who would be making sure the right one was used 
each time?).

This really doesn't seem to solve a real problem.

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah. An abbreviation such as MB should be known by an accessibility

</I>
In any case, what's the image in the case above? Why would you ever want 
that text _not_ visible when the image was visible?
