I think it won't be used by everyone, but some people have indicated a 
clear desire to not have to worry about the numbering of headers.

&lt;sidebar&gt; might be ok, but I wanted to avoid being too specific about the 
presentation in the name.

(&lt;acronym&gt; was removed because it's redundant with &lt;abbr&gt;.)
