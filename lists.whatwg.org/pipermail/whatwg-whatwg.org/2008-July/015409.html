Additionally, I just noticed that gmail does set the location.hash of 
the top window. So gmail would want to change the Location object for 
compat with legacy browsers.

And a library that used a hidden iframe for legacy browsers and really 
wanted to be compatible as far as the Location object goes (though i'm 
still unconvinced that anyone cares) could use iframe.history.pushState();
