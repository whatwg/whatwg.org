</I>&gt;<i> That is a performance killer.
</I>

I don't think it is as much of a performance killer as you say it is.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the standard connection limit is two. It is not
as though every external file could be loaded at once. Additionally, as I
said, you could split resources into multiple archives to take advantage of
multiple connections, because they can be loaded asynchronously without
issue.  Remember, the use case for this would be when there are likely
dozens of different files that need to be loaded.

So you get nondeterministic load behaviour anyway. This is not good.


This is not so different than directly requesting a file from multiple tabs.
Let's say page 1 and page 2 each use the same image. If I load page 2 first,
it will go directly to the server. If I load page 1 first, page 2 will get
the image from cache.

Clearly, there are other ways of performing this task, but I think this way
is simple and I know that I would gladly accept it as a possibility. It
falls within the same realm that any caching behavior does. It is meant
purely for performance, but if you are relying on it for a given behavior
then you are on a road to trouble.

The archived resources should be static, and also available as individual
files. Pre-fetching them should only be used for performance gains, and if
it would not be performant, it should not be used. However, I think there is
a fairly wide range of sites or applications that could benefit from this
feature. If there are other ways of improving it, or making it work better
for certain edge cases, that would be great, but don't throw the baby out
with the bath water.

Off the top of my head, I can think of a couple of ways to refine the
feature and deal with the issues raised.

   - Only blocking the loading of files that could logically be inside the
   archive: if the archive is located at &quot;/js/resources.zip&quot;, then the only
   files that should be blocked would have to be located under &quot;/js&quot;. &lt;img
   src=&quot;/images/lolcat.jpg&quot;/&gt; would not be blocked.
   - To go a step further, there could even be some kind of &quot;pattern&quot;
   attribute that would block the loading of files that matched a url pattern.
   For example, if the archive were located at &quot;/&quot;, but had a pattern of
   &quot;**.js,**.css,/images/*&quot;, only js, css, and files under the &quot;/images&quot;
   directory would be blocked.
