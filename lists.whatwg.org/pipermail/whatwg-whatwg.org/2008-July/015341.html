</I>
I agree it's undesirable, but I don't think it's a particularly big 
problem. I would imagine it is extremely rare that any pages out there 
is ever going to run in to this. We've never handled dynamic changes to 
&lt;base&gt; in gecko, and I've never heard any complaints about it. Similarly 
we end up in the situation where .href/.src returns a different URI than 
what was loaded, but I don't think that's a big deal either.

&gt;<i> I have to admit I am not especially excited about implementing instant 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic updates of everything in the document referencing a URI, whether 
</I>&gt;<i> it triggers a load or not, when the &lt;base&gt; element is changed. That 
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a lot of coding and testing work solely to serve a very 
</I>&gt;<i> unimportant edge case that right now likely no one depends on. In 
</I>&gt;<i> general if the spec requires significant implementation work for 
</I>&gt;<i> something that has no real user or author benefit, just because that is 
</I>&gt;<i> easier to define, then I think we have chosen poorly.
</I>
I feel exactly the same way. This is something that no-one is going to 
run in to most likely. And if they do it seems like something they could 
easily fix.

I honestly think this is a case where the web would do better with 
implementations spending time fixing other issues than adding code that 
no real website is going to trigger.
