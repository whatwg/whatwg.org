<PRE>I recall a little app called soundEdit (I think) that ran in the Mac back in 
the mid 1980's. I think it was shareware (at least it was ubiquitous).

The editing primitives were fairly cleanly defined and, had a reasonable 
metaphoric correspondence to the familiar drawing actions.

There was a thing where you could grab a few seconds of sound and copy it 
and paste it; you could drag and drop; you could invert (by just subtracting 
each of the tones from a ceiling) you could reverse (by inverting the time 
axis). You could even go in with your mouse and drag formants around. It was 
pretty cool.

It would not be a major task for someone to standardize such an interface 
and I believe any patents would be expired by now.
