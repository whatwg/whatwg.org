That should be resolved at the NPAPI level. There's no reason we should 
support Java as some sort of special case as compared to Flash, 
Silverlight, or other runtimes.


&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt; is supposed to be used in place of &lt;applet&gt;, but that can't

</I>
&lt;embed&gt; can also be used. We don't need three separate ways of doing this.


&gt;<i> The problem with &lt;embed&gt; is that it doesn't support fallback content. 
</I>&gt;<i> There's &lt;noembed&gt;, but that's only for when the &lt;embed&gt; element itself 
</I>&gt;<i> is not supported (because you have plugins turned off in your browser or 
</I>&gt;<i> something.).  Plus, &lt;noembed&gt; isn't really tied to any certain &lt;embed&gt;.
</I>
If the author could provide a non-propietary variant of the content, he 
wouldn't need to provide a proprietary one. So fallback isn't critical for 
this, IMHO. Authors seem to live quite well with just giving the user the 
choice of a Flash version or a no-Flash version, for instance.


&gt;<i> Also, &lt;embed&gt; in Opera doesn't collapse in situations like this: &lt;embed 
</I>&gt;<i> src=&quot;<A HREF="http://filenotfound&quot;">http://filenotfound&quot;</A> width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You just get a big plug-in content area on the page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There needs to be a defined behavior for what should happen here.
</I>
The spec now defines how &lt;embed&gt; works for these cases, more or less.


I didn't reply to all of your e-mail, but I think the issues you raised 
have either been resolved or are moot given the desire not to promote 
proprietary plugins over open Web formats. Please let me know if there are 
specific issues that still need fixing.

Right now the spec has some wacked thing with extension sniffing, which I 
hate. I really would much rather do real content sniffing. Why do browsers 
do extension sniffing here? Could we convince them to just do byte 
sniffing of the actual content?

There are a lot of videos sent as text/plain. I'm not sure we can ever get

How do we define that, beyond what the spec already says?

I'm not sure what to do about that.

That's not how browsers seem to behave -- they ignore the type if the 
extension is supported.


&gt;<i> Now, on the other hand :), having browsers go out of their way to make

Better for the Web on the long run maybe, but it won't be better for the 
browsers on the short run, so we likely won't get there from here.

That wouldn't really be compatible with how browsers work. Or to put it

Ignoring the Content-Type like this is a quite route to privilege

Right, the spec right now says to use the extension.

Based on my tests with images, it looks like browsers honour the extension 
before the MIME type.


&gt;<i> I'd like to see the steps spelled out *exactly* because HTML 4.01 does

The spec does now have the exact rules.


&gt;<i> Also, what about this &lt;embed src=&quot;file.asx&quot;&gt; (where the asx file is

The type=&quot;&quot; attribute overrides the extension.


&gt;<i> Things usually work without a type attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it should be encouraged though. It does have it's uses.

We can allow it, but we can't require it, really, since the author might

&gt;<i> It's a great hint if the browser can't figure out what to do with the

Actually it overrides both of those.


&gt;<i> Also, whether it currently works correclty this way or not,

</I>&gt;<i> windows media plug-in regardless of the the extension or type and leave

</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> Also, &lt;embed type=&quot;sometype&quot;&gt; without a src could be used to invoke a 
</I>&gt;<i> plug-in for scripting so that scripting could set a source.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> Maybe having a nosrc=&quot;true&quot; attribute would please me for this.
</I>
What would it do?


&gt;<i> Also, ( this is more with the object element ), if I specify a type=&quot;&quot;

</I>
That would probably break too many pages.


&gt;<i> If the type attribute is required and things failed if the server

</I>
That may have been true when the element was invented, but it's far too 
late now.


&gt;<i> Maybe having a strict=&quot;true&quot; for that would please me.

That seems like a feature that not many people would use.

The reserved attributes (like id=&quot;&quot;) still have their usual behaviour, so

Because the pages don't contain the plugins themselves, they contain 
content to be passed to a plugin.

Fixed.

That's allowed (but not required) by the current prose.

I don't understand the &quot;because&quot; here. This seems like a non-seqitur.

I don't understand.

HTML5 is a long way from being &quot;consistent&quot;. That's a battle we lost long
