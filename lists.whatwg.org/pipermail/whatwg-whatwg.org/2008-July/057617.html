<PRE>
I have written a new WHATWG specification for Workers:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-workers/current-work/</A>

I changed the API quite a bit from what Gears had, but Workers in the 
style of Gears' Worker Pools are now in HTML5.

</I>&gt;<i> }, false);
</I>&gt;<i> w.sendMessage(&quot;messageName&quot;, jsonStyleObject);
</I>
With the new API this would be:

   var w = createWorker(&quot;foo.js&quot;);
   w.onload = function () {
     w.postMessage(&quot;data&quot;);
   };
   w.onmessage = function (e) {
     // e.message has the data
   };

Inside the worker (foo.js):

   onconnect = function (o) {
     o.messagePort.onmessage = function (e) {
       // e.message has the data
     };
     o.messagePort.postMessage(&quot;data&quot;);
   };

Right now we don't have structured data, but that's marked an open issue 
in the spec for all the postMessage() methods.

This could now be done using workers.

</I>&gt;<i> Since postMessage API is looking more an more like the Gears worker

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WorkerWindow openWorker(in DOMString url);
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> with:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> interface WorkerWindow {
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    // for consistency with Window
</I>&gt;<i>    readonly attribute Window window;
</I>&gt;<i>    readonly attribute Window self;
</I>
Done.

&gt;<i>    // caps
</I>&gt;<i>    readonly attribute ClientInformation navigator;
</I>
Haven't added this yet, but only because I haven't defined it properly for 
normal windows yet either.

&gt;<i>    // session/local storage
</I>&gt;<i>    readonly attribute Storage sessionStorage;
</I>&gt;<i>    ...
</I>
sessionStorage makes no sense when you don't have sessions. Added 
localStorage though.

&gt;<i>    // database stuff
</I>&gt;<i>    Database openDatabase(...)
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>    // to open new worker windows
</I>&gt;<i>    WorkerWindow openWorker(in DOMString url);
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>    // messaging
</I>&gt;<i>    void postMessage(...)
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>    // some events
</I>&gt;<i>    attribute EventListener onabort;
</I>&gt;<i>    attribute EventListener onload;
</I>&gt;<i>    attribute EventListener onunload;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
In the worker we have onconnect (for when the connection starts) and 
onunload (for when it is closed brutally). The ports have onload (for when 
the connection starts), onmessage, onunload (for when the connection is 
dropped) and onerror (for when the script couldn't be loaded).

I believe all the features available in this idea are available in the 
spec I wrote too.

It makes it easier to take code intended for the main window and move it 
to a worker if we use the same terminology.


&gt;<i> &gt; WorkerWindow openWorker(in DOMString url);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can I supply a URL to an HTML file here? Does the file load and parse as 
</I>&gt;<i> an HTML document? Is the document accessible to the worker?
</I>
Right now it ignores MIME types and treats it as pure JS.


&gt;<i> Since the whole point of the worker is to do JavaScript work, should 
</I>&gt;<i> this string be a script instead of a URL?
</I>
Scripts are resources with URLs.


&gt;<i> How do I pass data to a worker?
</I>
postMessage on the channel to the worker.


&gt;<i> Is there an API contract regarding synchronization and/or order of 
</I>&gt;<i> execution?
</I>
There's no shared state.


&gt;<i> When is a worker considered loaded? Unloaded? Aborted?
</I>
That spec hopefully defines this in enough detail to be implemented.

</I>
As written, this isn't possible, you have to wait for the onload event on 
the port before sending events.

But really there's no reason why this should be the case. I can just as 
easily set up the ports so that they are immediately present, and then 
fire the error event (and discard events that were preemptively sent). 
Should we do this?

Send people my way when they ask you these questions.

We'd need something on the global object to point to the worker context... 
why add the extra level of indirection?

It is, and it does not.

Nobody wanted to implement the XML part, so it's not in.

XMLHttpRequest can be sync and is on the worker threads.


&gt;<i> - storage access in general
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> - synchronous db access
</I>
Not done yet, but on the cards. (This is more work since it involves a new 
API, not just repurposing an old one.)


&gt;<i> - access to a subset of the capabilities from the window.location
</I>&gt;<i> object, for example the &quot;href&quot; property and the &quot;reload&quot; method. We
</I>&gt;<i> have found that some workers want to reload themselves when they find
</I>&gt;<i> they can no longer communicate with their origin server
</I>
I don't follow. Could you elaborate? What happens to all the communication 
channels that were set up to that worker if it reloads itself?


&gt;<i> - access to read and write cookies. We have found that some workers
</I>&gt;<i> want to be able to modify the cookies for their origins
</I>
Not yet specified, as it is non-trivial, but I've noted the request. Is 
providing the 'cookie' attribute of the Document interface enough?


&gt;<i> - access to some sort of printline/console debugging facility
</I>
Not yet in the spec but noted; I'll add it in due course.


&gt;<i> I still think you should be able to pass JSON-style objects between
</I>&gt;<i> workers without needing to do the serialization yourself.
</I>
Agreed; we want this for frame postMessage() too. I've added a note to the 
spec to this effect. It's non-trivial to spec since there are so many ways 
to end up with something more than just dictionary/array/number/string/ 
boolean data.


&gt;<i> Another idea (and something that is present in Gears) is the ability to 
</I>&gt;<i> load workers from another origin. This provides a way to do controlled 
</I>&gt;<i> cross-origin communication that is more lightweight than loading an 
</I>&gt;<i> iframe and doing postMessage() with it.
</I>
This isn't allowed right now. Running script from another origin that was 
expecting to not be run except in a worker from the same origin could be 
problematic. However, you could create an iframe to that host, have the 
iframe create a worker, and then have the iframe pass a channel to the 
worker back to you and then self-destruct, leaving the worker from another 
origin being the only thing around.

An executing JavaScript script doesn't actually have access to its own 
source, typically, no. I mean, it could get a hold of it using XHR or 
something, but that's not really useful.

Experience with Gears has been that people just want to run scripts from 
URLs, so that's what is provided here. (At a pinch, you can always just 
use a data: URI.)
