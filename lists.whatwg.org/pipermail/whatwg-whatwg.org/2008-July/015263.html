</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually there are a number of features that cater for this use case

Agreed, there are more than a few features in HTML5, and some in other
working implementations, that cater to standalone webapps.

&gt;<i> In support of this new area of interest, I propose two new additions to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the ClientInformation interface as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First:  &quot;readonly attribute boolean standalone;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is in the same vein as the window.navigator.onLine property which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gives authors a great hint on how to change the behavior of their web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application based on the existence of a network connection.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standalone property would give web application developers a powerful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hint as to whether or not they are running in a full browser or in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more minimalistic, dedicated user agent. There's a number of things they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might customize based on this situation such as look, feel, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available feature set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very concerned about Web authors doing exactly this, and would in
</I>&gt;<i> fact strongly like to encourage authors not to do this. Can you give an
</I>&gt;<i> example of a use case where there would be a difference?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
IMO, navigator.onLine is a bit less vague than window.standalone with regard
to context. The web author has no idea what feature set impact standalone
really means for different UA.Being a bit more specific in the feature set
support would be better and isn't JS good enough at discovering API
existence?


&gt;<i> &gt; Second:  &quot;void makeStandalone();&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Web applications that have been fully designed to behave as stand alone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications should be able to announce this fact.  Currently web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications would have to state in their page that they are &quot;standalone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aware&quot; and to instruct users on how they might go about creating a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standalone version of the page.  I've seen and heard buzz that web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authors would like a better way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
IMO, webapps should not have to be &quot;fully&quot; designed to behave standalone to
in fact be run as standalone. Documentation sites are a good example of a
nice standalone webapp that needs no real internal support.


&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is what the makeStandalone() call is about.  The intention behind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the call is that the user agent would prompt the user about creating a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standalone application from the current page.  Of course user agents
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have full flexibility in how they respond to the call such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choosing to do nothing, prompting only once for a given domain or URL,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or prompting only when the user prefers to be prompted.  I imagine most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user agents would tie the workings of this method to a user action, much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like popup blocking works currently, so the page could only enact the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prompt when the user clicks on some control.  I just think it's quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; valuable to get the tool out there for web applications to use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The exact naming of this method call is up for debate, but I think my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point is clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The only reason I can see for such an API is to get the user's permission to
use features that _may_ be a bit of a security risk to normal webapps.
Clipboard, dock badging, local file drag-n-drop, even offline cache are some
examples.

Instead of a single API call, why not just ask the user whenever one these
&quot;security risk&quot; features is attempted, and remember the response on a per
site/domain/whatever basis?


&gt;<i> I'm not sure a method is the best solution here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I see it, based on discussions and other e-mails, here are the use
</I>&gt;<i> cases and requirements:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Sites want to offer a way for users to opt into a standalone mode
</I>&gt;<i>   (&quot;can we offer a link to download one of these standalone Web apps?&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>   Basically, to offer a way to bookmark the page as a standalone app
</I>&gt;<i>   instead of as a bookmark that opens in the browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
link rel ?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Sites want this mechanism to be inline so that they can position it on
</I>&gt;<i>   their page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
on the page? not sure it is as trustworthy there.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * It would be better if this mechanism could use user-agent specific
</I>&gt;<i>   iconology instead of site-specific iconology, so that users could learn
</I>&gt;<i>   to look for particular icons, as they have with RSS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
which has moved to browser UI


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Authors should be able to customise the look, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
well, not if it is in the browser UI


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * This mechanism shouldn't be visible in user agents where the feature
</I>&gt;<i>   isn't available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
agree


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * This mechanism shouldn't be visible when the user has already activated
</I>&gt;<i>   the feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
agree


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * It would be better if, for the previous two cases, instead of just
</I>&gt;<i>   hiding the feature, it could optionally (if desired by the author)
</I>&gt;<i>   be shown but disabled when not relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
not if it is in the browser UI


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * This mechanism shouldn't depend on scripts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * It shouldn't be something that appears in the browser's UI, since
</I>&gt;<i>   browsers have basically run out of room.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
disagree. it will depend in browser UI anyway for the confirm prompt


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * It would be better if this mechanism could integrate with the menu/
</I>&gt;<i>   command feature in HTML5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
why isn't this &quot;feature&quot; skipped and the menu/command used instead (when
needed)? when the app tries to use the menu/command the browser can prompt
and remember response.


&gt;<i>  * It would be better if this mechanism could be extended to support other
</I>&gt;<i>   similar features. In particular, people currently have links for
</I>&gt;<i>   calling window.print() and for invoking the RSS functionality of the
</I>&gt;<i>   browser, which could be integrated with this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
again, browser prompts for permission and remembers


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One possibility for addressing these requirements would be an element that
</I>&gt;<i> acts as a link, button, or icon, or some such, and which invokes user
</I>&gt;<i> agent features. Something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;browserbutton type=&quot;makeapp&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...where &quot;type&quot; has a value to provide the page as a standalone Web app, a
</I>&gt;<i> value to make the browser perform feed autodetection on the page and
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe to the relevant feed, a value to print the page, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
overengineered overkill . let's just stick to the real features that webapps
need to act more standalone and worry less about in-page badges
