Indeed, this is now specced.


&gt;<i> If an origin check fails when comparing the locations of the old window

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, this cross-domain security policy has one exception: the popup 
</I>&gt;<i> may set the location of its opener. This has phishing potential, 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly for webmail where opening external links in a new window is 
</I>&gt;<i> a very common use case. Hence I think it would be a good idea to let a 
</I>&gt;<i> site opt-out and specify that the popup should not have a window.opener 
</I>&gt;<i> property. For example, one could extend the &quot;features&quot; argument of 
</I>&gt;<i> window.open:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> window.open(url, name, 'openerproperty=0');
</I>
Using window.open() for this seems silly, this should just be a link.

I've made rel=noreferrer explicitly not include the opener as well as not 
including the Referer header. Does that address your use case?

I have not specified this, so this behaviour is currently non-compliant.

Opening a window then poking with it then navigating it seems like a lot 
of effort when all you want to do is have a link open a window without it 
being associated with the opener.

window.opener in WebKit seems to be replaceable.

Not as far as I can tell.

It's not really about use cases frankly, it's more about what browsers do 
today. Use cases are nice for new features but once pages rely on what 
browsers do, things become pretty immutable.

I've filed a bug to make sure that this is fixed once WebIDL allows us to 
fix it easily. (Right now the spec says the attribute is readonly.)

I don't think we can break these pages though.

I haven't been able to reproduce this. I seem to be able to set 'opener' 
without any problems.

This wouldn't affect 'opener' according to the HTML5 spec today.
