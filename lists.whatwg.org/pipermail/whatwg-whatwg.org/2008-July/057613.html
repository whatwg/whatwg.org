No need to go to particular _applications_ for inspirations when 
libraries developed with some generality in mind (e.g. 
<A HREF="http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/man/snack2.2/tcl-man.html">http://www.speech.kth.se/snack/man/snack2.2/tcl-man.html</A>) can serve as 
inspiration already. A carefully chosen subset of Snack might be a good 
start.

I see. However, to repeat what I said previously:

audio =/= music.

The direction you're hinting at would truly justify inventing a new 
element, since it sounds like it's specialized to synthesized music. But 
that's a pretty narrow subset of what audio encompasses.

Regarding the tediousness of doing things one sample at a time I agree, 
but maybe it's not as bad as it sounds. It depends on how fast 
JavaScript gets, and Squirrelfish is a very promising step (since the 
developers acknowledge they learnt the lessions from Lua, the next 
acceleration step could be to copy ideas from luajit, the extremely fast 
Lua-to-machine-code JIT compiler). If it gets fast enough, client-side 
libraries could do amazing stuff using sample-at-a-time primitives.

Still, as I suggest above, a few higher-level methods could be useful,
