</I>
Having considered everyone's opinion here, I've decided to stick with the 
original name, &lt;dialog&gt;. It has a few advantages: it starts with &quot;d&quot;, so 
it works well with &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;. It doesn't end in &quot;gue&quot;, so it hopefully 
avoids the problems that &quot;language&quot; had. It means the right thing.

I agree that the term is confusing with dialog boxes, however, nobody has 
made up the &lt;dialog&gt; element to mark up dialog boxes so far, so I see no 
reason for them to start. People who come across &lt;dialog&gt; are immediately 
going to see that it is for dialogue, so I don't see a problem here.

The problem is that the &lt;/dd&gt; end tag is optional, and &lt;p&gt; doesn't imply 
it, so this:

 &lt;dialog&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt; Baker's Wife
    &lt;dd&gt; Why, come in, little girl.
  &lt;dt&gt; Little Red Ridinghood
    &lt;dd&gt; I wish... It's not for me, it's for my Granny in the woods.  A 
         loaf of bread, please.  To bring my poor old hungry Granny in the 
         woods. Just a loaf of bread, please.
 &lt;/dialog&gt;

...works, but this:

 &lt;dialog&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt; Baker's Wife
    &lt;dd&gt; Why, come in, little girl.
  &lt;p&gt; Little Red Ridinghood enters the baker's shop.
  &lt;dt&gt; Little Red Ridinghood
    &lt;dd&gt; I wish... It's not for me, it's for my Granny in the woods.  A 
         loaf of bread, please.  To bring my poor old hungry Granny in the 
         woods. Just a loaf of bread, please.
 &lt;/dialog&gt;

...suddenly doesn't, you need to add the &lt;/dd&gt;. Which sucks.
