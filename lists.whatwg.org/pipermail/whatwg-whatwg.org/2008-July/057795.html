<PRE>Andres,

Thanks for your long effort in this issue. I know there is many issues of
more secure solution and specification for financial transactions. But, it
has been processed most of bank transaction and cyber trading in web browser
&quot;form&quot;. So new protocol and new specification is not good solution in actual
problem. In real world, financial transactions are already the part of web
especially &quot;HTML&quot;.

HTML5 is born because of HTML's innovative usage. If HTML 5 solves actual
problems with browser vendors, it can be done. New spec is very expensive
for actual problem of many bank and e-government sites as well as browser
vendors. Your job is also nessasary if bank or government want more secure
solution rather than HTML form method.

</I>&gt;<i> For a number of reasons, not least of which my lack of expertise in the

</I>&gt;<i> I include a representative sampling of the e-mails sent to the WHATWG on
</I>&gt;<i> the topic below, so that if anyone wishes to work on this topic, they can
</I>&gt;<i> use this feedback. I encourage people interested in this topic to approach

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I may also have confused Korea with Hongkong who definitely claimed that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you said, we may not get sufficient informations to standardize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; digital signature. But, in case of Korea, I'll sufficiently give them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The spec. and interface are almost standardized by governmental rules to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all vendors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In Korea, the own cryptic algorithm has been encouraged, so vendors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; couldn't use browser-implemented things such as DES. This is first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason to use activex controls.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second is for digital signature. Legally, all data must be signed by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user's key. When the money is sent, it needs to know who sends the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; money. So activex control has almost same user interface with browser's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certificate manager.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When an user enters an internet banking site, activex are embedded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; User's data by action go to activex control and are encrypted by SEED
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and signed by user's key. Encrypted and signed data gives hidden form in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web page again. When an user submit it, the data were transferred to web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server. The server-side application decrypts and verifies the data and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proceeds proper actions. Web server transfers the web page by requested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First thing is not standardized. National algorithm such as SEED or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Camella is problems between browser vendor and its governments. Second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be done such as (re)issue and revocation of personal certificates,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the digital signature such as old crypto.sign.Text().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As following is one of this efforts.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; range of this group. Most of forms directly go to web server via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; urlencoded. If some indicators are given, browsers can execute signing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submt&quot; value=&quot;Sending Money!&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When an user clicks submit button, the dialog box will be opened for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selecting the private certificates to be signed. Server can understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form data and attached signatures signed by browser via SSL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or it can be applied each forms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot; value=&quot;3.00&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway it is browser's the function of digital signature such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sign.Text() function. This idea make possible to handle easily them via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; May I try to explain how I look on web-forms and digital signatures?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most people indeed come up with schemes like the one you described
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it seems so obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I work with a different concept which is not really form-oriented, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather view-oriented.  This is borrowed from what most e-commerce sites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use today.  First you create an order using arbitrary web methods
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including &lt;form&gt;.  Then you typically input credit card data etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually you are faced with a consolidate/aggregated purchase
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction request which typically is just an HTML page with *static*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information plus an &quot;OK&quot; button.  When you hit OK, you do not send the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTML page, only an acknowledge of the request you had on the screen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, how does this map into digital signatures? The basic difference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with respect to the OK button is that the returned result contains a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signature over the view.  The actual (internal) transaction data is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typically not signed since it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - already is known in advance by the server otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   it wouldn't have been able to create a view to the user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - may not have any visual representation at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's more, the service also does its own calculation of message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; digests of the transaction request view and is thus able to immediately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; verify not only the signatures validity but that the user actually had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the proper content in his/her browser.  The signature is subsequently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stored close to the real transaction record for supporting unlikely (but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible), future dispute resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is an inherent problem with your suggested form:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;form name=&quot;sendmoney&quot; action=&quot;/send.cgi&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot; value=&quot;3.00&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;account&quot; values=&quot;1234567890&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submt&quot; value=&quot;Sending Money!&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because in a real-world case it would probably read:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;form name=&quot;sendmoney&quot; action=&quot;/send.cgi&quot; signed=&quot;signed&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;dollars&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;account&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submt&quot; value=&quot;Sending Money!&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which means that you sign data that has not first passed a server's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; validation.  Although XForms can do validation, I doubt XForms are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suitable for anything but simple applications. Server-based validation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can also cope with transactional issues that XF can't like bookings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also I wonder what you meant should be sent to the server. The signed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attributes only?  I think this is a half-baked idea since the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the document may contain important data that could affect the user's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision to sign th data.  The &quot;fine print&quot; for example :-) If you sign
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a house contract you don't sign the sales value but a lot of text and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conditions.  Digital signatures should IMHO afhere to this notion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In case there would be embedded objects like CSS or IMG in the HTML page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; holding the &lt;form&gt; they should also in some way be signed?  Now we have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a brand new format: Signed HTML. WASP does not need any specific signed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTML because its method is a bit like S/MIME although in XML.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition to that there are some cryptographic stuff that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addressed which makes the rather innocent &quot;signed&quot; attribute grow quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a bit.  If you look on the WASP CertificateFilter it is a good example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of how complex it can be to sign.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We also need an attachment feature.  It is a bit unclear how that could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be met with a &lt;form&gt; based approach unless all input is done in a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form which would be very constraining.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To not be stuck with HTML but also allow MS office, PDF Open Document we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also need some other mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is at least how WASP was conceived
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In case you have an example of a Korean HTML signature, I would be happy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to get a copy.
