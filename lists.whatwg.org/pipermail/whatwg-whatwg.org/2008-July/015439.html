(I'm replying only to the more salient e-mails in this thread, as the 
others mostly just repeated stuff. I'm also only cc'ing whatwg, since that 
seems to be where most of the contributors on this thread were subscribed 
to -- please don't cross-post, as it results in threads that appears to be 
missing parts in both lists, when people only subscribed to one list reply 
to e-mails from people on both lists.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well sure you can ignore the real world if you like, I'm just letting

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being spec compliant than making things work for their clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we need look at it in such a dramatic way. While some

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now if there is something about the HTML spec that stands in the way of

</I>&gt;<i> should try to solve it, or even how it *could*. Authors can generate 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;font&gt; already anyway. Their document just won't be conforming. What 
</I>&gt;<i> would those authors win by &lt;font&gt; being conforming? And then what about 
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of their problems? Because if their problem is their tool 
</I>&gt;<i> ignores CSS, they'll likely need much more presentational HTML than just 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;font&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And while we add all that presentational HTML to the spec, some

</I>
I tend to agree with this.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am sure there are just as many ingrained CMS's producing &lt;font&gt; tags

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Surely making a WYSIWYG editor remove font tags is no harder than any

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our CMS disallows any font menu/tags at all, has done for about 18

</I>
We have to aim for the future, not the past. By the time HTML5 is done, 
hopefully non-CSS-capable backend systems will be a thing of the past.

</I>&gt;<i> I also disagree - using &lt;SPAN&gt; and in-line styles is a significant

</I>
This I don't really agree with, but it's mostly moot. Having &lt;font&gt; with 
only style=&quot;&quot; vs &lt;span&gt; with only style=&quot;&quot; gains us nothing. Having the 
presentational attributes loses us valuable mindshare.

It's gone now.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now as for particular use cases - there are many people who are using

</I>&gt;<i> since I'm not an on-site consultant, I don't necessarily have all the 
</I>&gt;<i> details of why they want it to work this way. What I do know is that 
</I>&gt;<i> there are people who want to use presentational markup in HTML. This use

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully that clears up the confusion over what I'm seeing our clients 
</I>&gt;<i> do vs what I think the spec should include.
</I>
Sadly those systems end up tied to a particular medium, and fail to render 
in a good way for, say, users of text browsers or speech renderers. Not 
sure what to do about that though.
