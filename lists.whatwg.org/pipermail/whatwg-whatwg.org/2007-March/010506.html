<PRE>Hi,


&gt;<i> Even interoperability at the API and markup level would be a huge  
</I>&gt;<i> step forward relative to the current state of web video. While also  
</I>&gt;<i> having a single universally implemented codec would also be good,  
</I>&gt;<i> that may not presently be feasible.
</I>
A huge step that does not go all the way is not enough in this case.  If
the end result is still &quot;you are not sure if a user has this codec&quot; then
a web site designer will not care about the fact that the API is the
same, and the user will still not have guaranteed working video.

&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding the specific issue of mobile devices this is a highly  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; speculative argument.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is nothing stopping Theora chips from being produced and  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'hardware decoders' are actually programmable DSP's this is even  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less of an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real argument.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is true of hardware audio decoders, but not hardware video  
</I>&gt;<i> decoders, which use dedicated circuit blocks. If Ogg suddenly became  
</I>&gt;<i> popular it would likely be a several year pipeline before there were  
</I>&gt;<i> any hardware decoders.
</I>
There are cameras with embedded Ogg/Theora encoding that I've actually
seen and work.  I would be surprised if there are no Theora hardware
decoders, but I'm not in that business so I haven't seen any.  The BBC
is working on Dirac, a codec that is not even stable yet, and they are
planning to have a hardware encoder/decoder within the year.  &quot;Several
year pipeline&quot; sounds over-pessimistic.

&gt;<i> &gt; Case in point: my Nokia N800 certainly does not play H264.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Flash videos that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can play are not played using hardware decoder support.  I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware players that actually play H264 - I'm guessing the iPod  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video is one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; few, and that player does not support web browsing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most Flash video uses on the Sorenson Spark codec which is based on H. 
</I>&gt;<i> 263. This is a much less processor-intensive codec than more modern  
</I>&gt;<i> options, but also gives worse compression. H.264 has been approved as  
</I>&gt;<i> one of the codecs for 3GPP
</I>
H263 is &quot;mandatory&quot; for 3GPP, H264 is only &quot;suggested&quot;, and having dealt
with several phones for streaming I can tell you that not all phones
support H264.

Phones only support a select few widths and heights anyway, so I doubt
phones are relevant to this discussion at the moment.

&gt;<i> &gt; I am sure that if everyone else starts supporting Theora and Vorbis  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then Apple will quickly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start feeling comfortable, it's the way the market works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apple doesn't currently support WMV, despite it being a popular  
</I>&gt;<i> format for video on the web, so I'm not sure that follows.
</I>
Me neither.  But that argument sounds a lot like &quot;Apple will only
support a codec that it already supports.&quot;  If Apple is unwilling to
budge from that, then we're not discussing about inter-operating :)

Thomas
