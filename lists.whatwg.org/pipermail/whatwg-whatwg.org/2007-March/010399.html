There are devices that have a hardware video decoder but not enough  
CPU power for even relatively simple video. These could justifiably  
omit Ogg under the SHOULD clause. Others would simply burn battery at  
an unacceptable rate while doing software video decoding. Would these  
too be justified in omitting Ogg support under the SHOULD clause? If  
so, then not much interoperability is being gained, ultimately.

While it's hard to have certainty, I am pointing out that the  
relative risk assessment can look different depending on one's position.

</I>&gt;<i> Just because previous HTML specifications have been deficient in

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think having a single baseline codec will make &lt;video&gt; immensely

</I>&gt;<i> believe from the point of view of Mozilla (or any other open source  
</I>&gt;<i> project) Theora is vastly more attractive than MPEG. If we don't  
</I>&gt;<i> ship MPEG and other vendors don't ship Theora, then the &lt;video&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> element will be hobbled from the start.
</I>
I agree that a baseline set of codecs would be good. I'm just not  
sure it is possible to reach consensus on what that set should be.  
 From Apple's point of view, MPEG is significantly more attractive  
than Ogg.
