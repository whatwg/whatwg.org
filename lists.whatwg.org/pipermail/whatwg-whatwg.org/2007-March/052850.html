<PRE>The current draft of HTML5 has an automatic cross-reference feature with  
the span, abbr, code, var, samp, and i elements, which would point to a  
matching &lt;dfn&gt; element.

    <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-dfn">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-dfn</A>

The current design has a number of problems, as discussed in #html-wg:

[22:46] &lt;mjs&gt; I think there should be a specific element for a  
cross-reference
[22:46] &lt;mjs&gt; the current design is easy to process staticaly but bad for  
dynamic updates, I think
[...]
[22:49] &lt;mjs&gt; to deal with dynamic updates, you need to have a hashtable  
of all dfn defined terms, and the text contents of all span, abbr, code,  
var, samp and i attributes (excluding ones that currently have an  
interactive element or dfn as an ancestor or descendant, etc etc
[22:49] &lt;mjs&gt; I mean, the rule defining what elements it applies to is a  
6-line sentence
[22:50] &lt;mjs&gt; the spec really needs to be fixed not to have such complex  
sentences
[...]
[22:51] &lt;mjs&gt; anyway, it would be much simpler if there was a &lt;term&gt;  
element
[22:51] &lt;anne&gt; there actually used to be &lt;x&gt;
[22:51] &lt;mjs&gt; then the rule can be much simpler, and you don't need to  
keep a big hashtable on the side for documents that use &lt;i&gt; just to  
italicize
[22:51] &lt;anne&gt; for cross references
[22:51] &lt;mjs&gt; x for cross-reference?
[22:51] &lt;anne&gt; but then it was dropped
[22:52] &lt;mjs&gt; I don't like one-letter tag names so much
[22:52] &lt;mjs&gt; HTML has enough of those
[...]
[22:54] &lt;anne&gt; Although I suppose implementing it is complex introducing  
&lt;term&gt; makes authoring a lot more involved.
[22:54] &lt;anne&gt; Instead of typing &lt;code&gt;foobar&lt;/code&gt; you have to type  
&lt;term&gt;&lt;code&gt;foobar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/term&gt;
[22:54] &lt;anne&gt; that's an additional [13] characters each time you use the  
term
[22:55] &lt;anne&gt; (otoh, it saves you at least six characters if you don't  
want the cross referencing to happen)
[22:55] &lt;anne&gt; (but that's rare)
[22:55] &lt;mjs&gt; &lt;x&gt; would be better that way I guess
[...]
[22:57] &lt;mjs&gt; the problem w/ the current design isn't mainly that  
implementing is complex
[...]
[22:58] &lt;mjs&gt; it's more that you have a choice of either: (a) regenerating  
the cross-references on any dynamic update will be very slow or (b) you  
have to waste a lot of memory in documents that don't use cross-references
[22:58] &lt;mjs&gt; (to track the state needed in case you dynamically update)
[22:59] &lt;mjs&gt; those seem like a big cost for a feature with a pretty  
specialized use case
[22:59] &lt;anne&gt; well, you only need to start using memory when you  
encounter both a &lt;dfn&gt; and one of the others
[22:59] &lt;anne&gt; (or after they're both inserted)
[23:00] &lt;mjs&gt; but that means when you do encounter a &lt;dfn&gt; you now have to  
walk the whole document
[23:00] &lt;anne&gt; if you also encountered one of the others, yes
[23:01] &lt;mjs&gt; but maybe you have one of those rare documents that does not  
contain any &lt;span&gt; or &lt;i&gt; elements
[23:01] &lt;mjs&gt; those are the main problematic ones
[23:01] &lt;mjs&gt; the others are rare enough in normal documents that always  
hashing their contents is reasonable
[23:01] &lt;mjs&gt; but you still have the problem of how complex the rule is,  
presumably to avoid accidental cross-references
[...]
[23:03] &lt;anne&gt; the rule is complex due to potential nesting issues
[23:04] &lt;mjs&gt; with a specialized element you would not need to worry about  
that, since you could make nesting of that element non-conformant for  
documents, and then let both cross-references happen
[23:05] &lt;anne&gt; &lt;dfn&gt;&lt;x&gt;test&lt;/x&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt;
[23:06] &lt;zcorpan&gt; an attribute? &lt;code xref&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;
[23:07] &lt;zcorpan&gt; that's clearer than &lt;code title&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; when you  
don't want it to be a xref, imho
[23:07] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: I see no deep problem w/ making that a cross-reference  
to itself, but you could also make &lt;x&gt; in &lt;dfn&gt; non-conforming
[23:08] &lt;anne&gt; well, non-conforming doesn't help UAs
[23:08] &lt;zcorpan&gt; perhaps i should propose xref=&quot;&quot; to the list (or is  
there a better name?), i like it
[23:08] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: well, then you don't need to worry about the weirdness  
of it being an xref to itself
[23:09] &lt;mjs&gt; anyway, &lt;a id=&quot;foo&quot; href=&quot;#foo&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt; is legal
[23:09] &lt;anne&gt; yes, I'm just saying that you have to define what the UA  
has to do
[23:09] &lt;anne&gt; the current draft does that
[23:09] &lt;mjs&gt; zcorpan: global attributes suck, though in this case it  
makes some sense
[23:09] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: yeah, it defines it with a very complex rule
[23:09] &lt;zcorpan&gt; mjs: i didn't say it should be global
[23:09] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: I'd rather have a design that has a simple rule
[23:09] &lt;anne&gt; it also avoids &lt;a&gt;test &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for instance  
(although arguably &lt;x&gt; can be nested there)
[23:10]  -&gt; Lachy has joined html-wg
[23:10]  anne sort of likes the boolean attribute idea
[23:10] &lt;zcorpan&gt; mjs: it would only do anything on the elements that are  
currently xref elements
[23:10] &lt;mjs&gt; &lt;x&gt; in &lt;a&gt; and vice versa could be disallowed, just as &lt;a&gt;  
in &lt;a&gt; is
[23:10] &lt;mjs&gt; zcorpan: that's not a bad idea
[23:10] &lt;mjs&gt; zcorpan: although it still leaves the complicated rules  
about interactive elements
[23:10] &lt;anne&gt; mjs, you're talking authoring and I'm talking UA criteria
[23:11] &lt;anne&gt; &lt;a&gt; in &lt;a&gt; has to be handled by the UA, for instance
[23:11] &lt;zcorpan&gt; mjs: how so? can't we just say that it's always a  
&quot;link&quot;, regardless of where you put it? just like &lt;a&gt; inside &lt;a&gt;?
[23:12] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: I'm saying if something is non-conformant, then the UA  
handling can be something that gives a weird result
[23:12] &lt;anne&gt; yeah, with the attribute you could make stuff less complex
[23:12] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: just like &lt;a&gt; in &lt;a&gt;
[...]
[23:13] &lt;anne&gt; mjs, sure, as long as it's the same accross UAs
[...]
[23:12] &lt;mjs&gt; anne: an example of a very simple rule would be to totally  
ignore nesting
[23:12] &lt;mjs&gt; I think that's a fine rule if you explicitly ask for an  
xref, whether it's with an xref attribute or an &lt;x&gt; element
[23:12] &lt;anne&gt; yeah
[23:14]  anne is ok with that too
[23:15] &lt;mjs&gt; the reason for the weirdness about nesting is really only  
needed because cross-ref semantics are overloaded onto elements that you  
may well be using for a totally different purpose



So. The proposal here is to replace the current xref design with a boolean  
attribute &quot;xref&quot; on the span, abbr, code, var, samp, and i elements, that,  
when present, makes the element a cross-reference to a &lt;dfn&gt; element with  
a matching term. (What is a term is already defined in the spec, and is  
fine.)

As noted in the discussion above, it would have the following advantages:

  * Simpler to implement in a way that performs well (especially in the  
case of dynamic updates).
  * Doesn't have the nesting case problem (just like &lt;a&gt; doesn't).
  * Potentially simpler to author, given that you don't need to actively  
disable xrefs on elements you *don't* want to be xrefs. (The current spec  
source has title=&quot;&quot;s all over the place just to disable xrefs.)


To illustrate the difference in markup, here are two extracts of the spec  
source:

    &lt;li&gt;It is an &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;applet&lt;/code&gt;,
    &lt;code&gt;area&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt;, or
    &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; element with a &lt;code
    title=&quot;attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute equal to &lt;var
    title=&quot;&quot;&gt;key&lt;/var&gt;, or,&lt;/li&gt;

...

       &lt;p&gt;Let &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;x&lt;sub title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;var
       title=&quot;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; be the &lt;span&gt;(2&lt;var
       title=&quot;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;th entry in &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/var&gt;,
       and &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;y&lt;sub title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;var
       title=&quot;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; be the &lt;span&gt;(2&lt;var
       title=&quot;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;+1)&lt;/span&gt;th entry in &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/var&gt;
       (the first entry in &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;coords&lt;/var&gt; being the one
       with index 0).&lt;/p&gt;


With this proposal, they would look like:

    &lt;li&gt;It is an &lt;code xref&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code xref&gt;applet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code
    xref&gt;area&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code xref&gt;form&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code xref&gt;img&lt;/code&gt;, or
    &lt;code xref&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; element with a &lt;code xref
    title=&quot;attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute equal to &lt;var&gt;key&lt;/var&gt;,
    or,&lt;/li&gt;

...

       &lt;p&gt;Let &lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; be the
       &lt;span&gt;(2&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;th entry in &lt;var&gt;coords&lt;/var&gt;,
       and &lt;var&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; be the
       &lt;span&gt;(2&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;+1)&lt;/span&gt;th entry in &lt;var&gt;coords&lt;/var&gt;
       (the first entry in &lt;var&gt;coords&lt;/var&gt; being the one with index
       0).&lt;/p&gt;

That is, the first becomes a bit longer, but the second becomes shorter.  
IMHO it is easier to understand what the markup does with this proposal.
