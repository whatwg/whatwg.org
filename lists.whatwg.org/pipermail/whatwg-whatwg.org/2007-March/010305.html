<PRE>I was clearly mislead by the &quot;window.opener and security&quot; title then

</I>&gt;<i> of getting a windowobject reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hallvord's solution is a workaround - it addresses the ability to get

</I>&gt;<i> problem.

</I>&gt;<i> I do agree about the responsibility side here. It's just doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> No. He just gave a counterexample to your suggestion, a use case your
</I>&gt;<i> solution would have broken. It wasn't relevant for his original
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some thing I would like to add here, is that your &quot;solution&quot; doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> do anything to solve the actual l problem case. Even if window.opener
</I>&gt;<i> would be read only, that is just a reference to a window object. Even
</I>&gt;<i> if that property would be read only you could still write to the
</I>&gt;<i> location property of the window object it references. For your
</I>&gt;<i> solution to work the read only attribute would have to cascade to all
</I>&gt;<i> properties, something defying the nature of JavaScript.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A much better solution, in my opinion, would be to make the location
</I>&gt;<i> object safe from cross domain attacks by making it only writable from
</I>&gt;<i> same domain, or if the document does not have a domain yet.
</I>&gt;<i> (window.open without address) I do think this would break some sites,
</I>&gt;<i> however.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hallvord's solution of allowing sites to disable the window.opener
</I>&gt;<i> property and thereby preventing the writing to window.opener.location
</I>&gt;<i> does solve the problem for that particular window object, as an opt-in
</I>&gt;<i> security measure. The main problem I see with this approach is that if
</I>&gt;<i> people aren't nulling the window.opener property already I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> they would opt in for another alternative method of doing it. Actually
</I>&gt;<i> fixing cross domain writing to the location object would.
