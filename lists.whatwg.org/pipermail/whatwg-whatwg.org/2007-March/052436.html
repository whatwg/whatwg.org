</I>
What are the events?  I scanned the spec for events:
begin (can this be caught by script? is that what &quot;at the &lt;video&gt;
element&quot; means?)
progress
stalled
stopped
load
abort

Is this accurate?

I noticed the stop() method is used both to stop playback and to abort
any pending download.  Is this a good idea?  Wouldn't it be simpler to
add abort() to explicitly stop the download?

Are timeout's guaranteed to be in sync with the video?  For example:
// assume myvid.position = 0;
myvid.play();
myvid.setTimeout('alert(myvid.position);', 10);

What happens?

I have a hunch most authors will care more about time till the end
than time since the 0.  I don't have any evidence for this, and don't
know why I think it.  Except for...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't see a need for this, if other things are reasonable, we can
implement continuous playback or a playlist using something like.....

// could make a microformat to describe playlists... perhaps XOXO with an
// extra classname.  playlist could be parsed from the dom, or provided
// via some other mechanism.
var playlist = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
var current = 0;
var mainVideo = document.getElementById('myvideo');
var dummyVideo = document.getElementById('dummyvideo');
window.onload = function() {
  mainVideo = playlist[current];
};

// would *REALLY* prefer a finished event or something to tell the
difference between
// the user watching the video completely, and it having stopped, and
script or the
// user pressing a stop button.
// because otherwise, the code to tell if we've stopped looks something like:
video.stopEvent = function(callback) {
  // not sure these apply()'s do what I think they would do.
  callback = function(this) {
    if(this.state == PLAYING) {
      return callback.apply(this);
    }
  };
  setTimeout(callback.apply(this), video.length - video.position);
};
// which is pretty undesirable, as it still doesn't always do what you
would expect.
// (eg. if the time to finish changes because of a seek, or the video's src
// changes or something...)
// so assuming a stopped event existed...
mainVideo.finished = onFinishedMain;

onFinishedMain = function() {
  // uh... does the cache kick in, or do we need to clone and delete? :-&gt;
  mainVideo.src = dummyVideo.src;

  // uh.. if the src changes, does my event stick, or do I need to reassign it?
  //mainVideo.finished = onFinishedMain;
current++;

}

function queueNextVideo() {
  if(nearlyComplete(mainVideo) {
    // have the next one start downloading...
    dummyVideo.src = playlist[current+1];
  }
  if(current &lt; playlist.length) {
    setTimeout(queueNextVideo, mainVideo.length*.20);
  }
}

function nearlyComplete(video) {
  if(video.state == PLAYING) {
    if(video.position/video.length &gt; .80) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

Something like that would be pretty common, I think.  I suspect most
script authors will want to know when a video is nearing completion,
and when the user has finished watching it.  It's also a common
technique for authors to buffer images in the background, and then
swap them in when needed.  (BTW, one thing that is really annoying is
not knowing when resources [like images or scripts] failed to load.)

OHHH I see, there is a &quot;played&quot; range, and that you can use /that/ to
tell if the user has seen the whole thing or not...  still seems a bit
tricky to figure it out, if all you want is an event for &quot;we've just
finished watching the whole thing now, thanks!&quot;

What happens to the played range after we use seek()?

My previous example makes a lame attempt at pre-fetching.  If you
change the src element to a previously dereferenced resource, how does
the cache behave?  Will we need to clone and delete nodes instead?


&gt;<i> &gt; The frame capturing would be cool (and useful).

Only thing I can think of is the initial screen cap shown (or is this
different?)  Perhaps for the image to show, you can just use an &lt;img&gt;
in the content of the &lt;video&gt;. Like
&lt;video ...&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;screencap&quot; src=&quot;screencap&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

Timely captions could also probably be implemented in script using
clever timeouts and sniffing for the playback state.  It could
probably represented declaritively using semantic html techniques, as
well.

&lt;div id=&quot;captions&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#myvideoelement&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;view&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
