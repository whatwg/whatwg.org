&gt;<i> Mostly unused, not even deprecated, these elements bloat the spec,
</I>&gt;<i> confuse lay authors (i.e. those not of a computer science background)
</I>&gt;<i> and I feel would be better represented by a custom XML vocabulary.
</I>
Your method might introduce a lot of stuff a lot of people need, but it
would remove a lot of stuff a smaller group needs.  A properly sectioned
specification could group, e.g., computer related elements together and
put them on another page, much like W3C did with &quot;phrase elements&quot; [1]. 
Likewise, &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;newspaper&quot; based tags could be placed in their own
section, as well.

Most lay authors don't read the specs.  It doesn't help my case, but I
read a blog once that gave spotlight to tags that most people didn't use. 
Many comments were along the lines of, &quot;I didn't know that existed.&quot;  If
the lay authors don't know about it, it won't confuse them.

As far as bloat, I wouldn't call these tags bloat.  Something is bloat if
it is there for no reason or because it really is useless.  I strongly
believe that more tags to define more semantics would be a good thing. 
I'd love to stop misappropriating the &lt;q&gt; tag when I really want something
like &lt;soCalled&gt;. [2]

&gt;<i> You completely misunderstood. I was arguing against the need for
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;var&gt;, &lt;samp&gt; et al.
</I>
My apologies.

&gt;<i> I.E. Markup *within* code/computer terminal representation, not
</I>&gt;<i> against &lt;code&gt; itself.
</I>&gt;<i> I welcome &lt;code&gt; to mark up blocks of code, but I don't think HTML
</I>&gt;<i> should go further than that, if you want to mark up computer code   that
</I>&gt;<i> badly, use XHTML + some CodeML equivalent to MathML.
</I>
I'd love to, but one of the major browsers doesn't support XHTML. :(

&gt;<i> But how can you justify the presence of &lt;kbd&gt; when so few people   write
</I>&gt;<i> content where keyboard input has to be represented?
</I>
&lt;form&gt;
 &lt;label&gt;
   Enter your e-mail address (example: &lt;kbd&gt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">joe at gmail.com</A>&lt;/kbd&gt;
   &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;email&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&gt;<i> Why isn't &lt;tv-show&gt; an  element?
</I>
I just use &lt;cite&gt; when I reference a TV show.  Cite is another element
that I wish had more power...

&gt;<i> One only has to look at the examples given in the HTML5 spec to see
</I>&gt;<i> how esoteric &lt;samp&gt; is:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-samp">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-samp</A>
</I>
It's used to mark computer output.  That isn't esoteric.  &lt;samp&gt; might not
be the best name for the tag, but it does have a specific meaning.

&gt;<i> I strongly agree. It's domain is also not clear enough either. Does
</I>&gt;<i> morse code count? What about encoded strings?  &lt;code
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;rot13&quot;&gt;uryyb eboreg&lt;/code&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> People who aren't programmers have a different understanding of the
</I>&gt;<i> meaning of the word than we do. Confusing elements leads to both
</I>&gt;<i> decreased and incorrect usage.
</I>
It says &quot;computer code.&quot;  That would rule out Morse code.  I've always
looked at &quot;computer code&quot; to be lay-speak  for &quot;programming languages and
the like.&quot;  It may, again, come down to the description of the tag, not
the tag itself.

&gt;<i> No, you missed the point again. &lt;samp&gt; is short for sample. Misguided
</I>&gt;<i> hair care people of the future will think their product sample counts
</I>&gt;<i> as a sample and use it for that.
</I>
My point was: I can sell you a hunting rifle for hunting, but I can't stop
you from using it as a walking stick.  All I can do is say, &quot;this is
intended to be used to kill animals.&quot;  It's not the hunting rifle's fault.
 It's not my fault.  You're the one using it the wrong way.  People
misused &lt;blockquote&gt; to indent text, for example.

&gt;<i> Quite frankly most real-world/normal
</I>&gt;<i> people (e.g. your greengrocer) don't care whether something is
</I>&gt;<i> computer output or not, but they could very well benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;product&gt; labelling up SKUs on their supplier's website, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> We can't add elements willy-nilly without creating bloat though, and
</I>&gt;<i> the dead wood has to be cropped to keep the tree healthy.
</I>
But some people (e.g. your programmer) do care if it is computer output. 
You are telling one group to go to hell while embracing another.  I don't
know why grocers are more important than programmers (and I'm certainly
not suggesting the other way around).  The problem with your
interpretation of the word &quot;bloat&quot; is that it is a see-saw.  We can either
1) serve one group better and another worse or 2) serve two groups poorly.
 Rather, we could serve all groups well by adding tags in a calculated
manner (not willy-nilly) so as to avoid cruft while still providing a rich
set of semantically useful elements.  Just because I like my programming
tags doesn't mean I don't like your retail tags.  We can coexist.

That said, &lt;var&gt; may be cruft.  I would just use &lt;code&gt;.  But, I think
computer input (&lt;kbd&gt;), computer output (&lt;samp&gt;), and the stuff that
processes it (&lt;code&gt;) are important to people who program for a living,
just as &lt;product&gt; would be important to someone who sells stuff for a
living.  Adding useful elements wouldn't hurt.  Removing perceived useless
elements may.
