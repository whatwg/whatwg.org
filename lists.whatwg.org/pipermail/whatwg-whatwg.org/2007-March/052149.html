I'm not doing content negotiation here. There's one representation 
available. It is XHTML. We can send that to most browsers and they'll 
deal reasonably. Two I know of have problems (IE and Lynx) so we lie to 
them and tell them it's text/html.

I am curious what problems Google has with XHTML. Then they deal.

What browsers can't handle this?

Theoretically, it is completely spec compliant for a browser to notice 
PUBLIC identifier in the DOCTYPE, use that to resolve entities or do 
whatever else it needs to do with that DTD, and never actually load the 
file at the SYSTEM ID. You absolutely can use all defined entities that 
are available in XHTML 1/HTML 4. Practically, that's exactly what 
happens in every browser I've tested, but there might be one I've missed 
somewhere.

If you meant that you can't define new entities, then that's essentially 
correct. That's also true of HTML of course.
