   This is not a definition of the &lt;a&gt; element. In fact, &lt;a&gt; is defined
as a anchor, not a hyperlink.

   By contrast, the |href| attribute &quot;specifies the location of a Web
resource&quot;. Thus, using |href| for hyperlinks on other elements is an
alteration of the attribute's semantics, because the element you put
them on doesn't have the semantics of a source anchor.

&gt;<i> Any element is allowed to be a tail of the hyperlink:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The id attribute may be used to create an anchor at the start tag
</I>&gt;<i> of any element (including the A element).&quot; [2]
</I>
   While one could argue that the |id| element give anchor semantics to
an element, it is clear that in this context the text implicitly refers
to the semantics of a DESTINATION anchor, not a source anchor. Even if
you were to ignore this context, it would mean that using |href| as a
global attribute would ALWAYS require you to include an |id| attribute
on the element.

&gt;<i> But I do not understand why we have such a limitation for
</I>&gt;<i> the head of the hyperlink.
</I>
   The definition of &lt;a&gt; as inline is the only limitation in HTML I'm
aware of. Everything else is a CSS issue, and we should generally avoid
making fundamental alterations to HTML purely to achieve presentational
ends.

&gt;<i> There are multiple semantically correct cases when
</I>&gt;<i> block elements like &lt;li&gt;, &lt;option&gt;, &lt;address&gt; , &lt;img&gt; etc.
</I>&gt;<i> *are* hyperlinks.
</I>
   Actually, by the definition you quoted, they're not hyperlinks and
can never be hyperlinks because a hyperlink is a relationship. In HTML
4.01, they can't even be source anchors. The HTML 4.01 version of |href|
doesn't have the semantics to make them source anchors even if you made
the attribute global.

   So let's be clear that what you're talking about is making every
element semantically an &lt;a&gt; element. In other words, every element would
automatically be a source anchor. Thus, you have taken semantics that
were explicitly represented by an element and made them implicit and
invisible in the markup. This is a poor way of dealing with semantics
that are at the very heart of the World Wide Web, and I would certainly
not call it &quot;semantically correct&quot;.

&gt;<i> But designers are forced to use
</I>&gt;<i> weird tricks to fight with inline nature of &lt;a&gt;s.
</I>
   That issue can be addressed without getting rid of &lt;a&gt;, by either
allowing &lt;a&gt; to contain block-levels, or by creating a new block-level
container with equivalent semantics.
