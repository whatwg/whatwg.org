I'm excited about Apple's video team being on board with this.  While  
everyone's efforts thus far have brought us a long way, having more  
info from audio and video professionals could really refine this.   
Comments as I read:

&gt;<i> If the presentation of timed media by the user agent has been  
</I>&gt;<i> disabled, if the resource has an unsupported type, or if the  
</I>&gt;<i> preparations for its presentation fail either because of a protocol  
</I>&gt;<i> failure or because the format of the media is unrecognized, the  
</I>&gt;<i> user agent must fire an error event on the element and display the  
</I>&gt;<i> element's fallback content, if available.
</I>
So, we have some fallback control.  That is good, as it is lacking  
from WHAT WG at the moment and was something I'm concerned about.    
This is how I intuitively felt it should work.  I'm glad that is  
specified.

&gt;<i> The controller attribute is a boolean attribute. If the attribute  
</I>&gt;<i> is present, the user agent must display a user interface which  
</I>&gt;<i> allows the user to control the media element. The height attribute  
</I>&gt;<i> on the element does not include the size of the controller, it is  
</I>&gt;<i> the size of the video element only
</I>
I like being able to specify this, but the height of the controller  
needs to:
1) Be set normatively in this specification.  If the height of the  
controller area changes across browsers, it's going to be a source of  
irritation for developers.
2) Be set in CSS (as well as positioning options... I'd guess through  
a pseudo element like :controller?).

&gt;<i> Should we specify the position of the controller? Should we specify  
</I>&gt;<i> what controls it should have?
</I>
I could take it or leave it.  Specifying what controls might be  
nice.  Specifying the position, I think, should be a CSS thing.

&gt;<i> When the src attribute is set, the user agent must immediately  
</I>&gt;<i> begin to download the specified resource unless the user agent  
</I>&gt;<i> cannot support video/audio, or its support for video/audio has been  
</I>&gt;<i> disabled
</I>
One reason I like YouTube is that the download is user-initiated.  If  
I include YouTube content on my site, they see a nice thumbnail from  
the video and a big play button.  If they are on dial-up, they don't  
have to download it.  Autodownload, to me, is flawed.  I know I can  
set up the image and video stuff with JavaScript to work like  
YouTube.  But if the user DOESN'T have JavaScript on, they are stuck  
with nothing.  I would love to see an &quot;autodownload&quot; attribute to  
complement &quot;autoplay&quot; or use &quot;autoplay=0&quot; to disable the auto  
download.  A way to add a thumbnail would be nice while not auto  
downloading.

&gt;<i> The DOM attribute currentRate is the rate at which a media element  
</I>&gt;<i> is currently playing.
</I>
I'm guessing this would be in frames per second?  Is it the frames  
per second it is playing or the available frames per second encoded  
in the video?

&gt;<i> The DOM attribute hasAudio returns a value that specifies whether  
</I>&gt;<i> the element has audio media.
</I>
Does a video element hasAudio return true or false?  Is this based  
only on the existence of some media or will it determine if the video  
actually has an audio track?
