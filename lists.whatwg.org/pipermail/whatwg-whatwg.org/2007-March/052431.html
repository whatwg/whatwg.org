<PRE>I think I am clearly missing something.
If we take your example, a parent element and several child elements.

If you want to perform an action on mouseover of a child -&gt; attach  
the event there and cancel bubble.
If you want to perform an action on parent mouseover -&gt; attach to  
parent element and check the target of the event.

Maybe your use case requires something different, but I can't imagine  
that scenario.
It is not good programming to know that events bubble and not to  
check the target IMHO anyway.

As for redundancy, the keypress event can be distinct from keydown  
and keyup, in that kepress does not fire for meta-keys, but the other  
two do, in some browsers. (Although I do admit a consensus in  
implementation would be good here)

</I>&gt;<i> and keypress (keydown+keyup).
