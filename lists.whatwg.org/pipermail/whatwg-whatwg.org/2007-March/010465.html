<PRE>Continuing today's flood of emails from me to this list, here's another.
Note: I never bothered to read this thread the first time, but since  
Henri has brought to the top of my email client again, I started from  
the beginning.

I want to comment on the eight bullets given at:
<A HREF="http://www.alleged.org.uk/pdc/2003/xhtml2-cite.html">http://www.alleged.org.uk/pdc/2003/xhtml2-cite.html</A>
(a page linked from Joe Clark's original article)

These aren't that well thought through, I'm just throwing them out to  
be peed upon.

&#8226; 1 and 2 are both proper nouns, names of things.
These could be addressed with &lt;name&gt; with predefined classes &quot;book&quot;,  
&quot;movie&quot; and &quot;ship&quot; producing italic output (and &quot;person&quot;, &quot;animal&quot;,  
&quot;product&quot; etc not doing so)
More thought would be needed here, like perhaps only applying  
for :lang(en) parent elements, such as:
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favourite film is &lt;name class=&quot;movie&quot;  
lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;Amelie&lt;/name&gt;. I have it on &lt;abbr&gt;DVD&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

&#8226; Bullets 3 to 6 could be addressed with a &lt;term&gt; element, default  
rendering italic (not related to &lt;dt&gt;). You can apply any adjective  
you want to term and it seems to remain valid: foreign term,  
mathematical term, new terminology, etc. It would seem quite  
versatile yet remain semantically useful without becoming too general.

&#8226; Bullet 7: I think people marking up computer code in HTML are  
completely wasting their time. Most sample code I have seen doesn't  
bother. e.g. some random OpenGL sample code:
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Red_Rocket/listing4.html">http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Red_Rocket/listing4.html</A>
<A HREF="http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=Mac_OS_X">http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=Mac_OS_X</A>
The usage case for this vs. usage of HTML for the rest of the  
internet is insufficient to earn the right to be in HTML.

&#8226; Bullet 8: We already have &lt;em&gt;

I hate them :-)
I would love to see &lt;var&gt; &lt;samp&gt; &lt;kbd&gt; et al. officially deprecated.
In fact, we could just deprecate anything that was in HTML 1.0 and  
hasn't earned itself more than 1% usage. No-one would miss them. (And  
if they do they can author in XML.)

I think elements should earn their place in the standard and get  
kicked out if the use case is too obscure or there is a more  
appropriate markup language available (MathML, DocBook).

I fear that in 100 years we'll be downloading free shampoo to our  
molecular synthesizers that will come wrapped in HTML &lt;samp&gt; tags.
