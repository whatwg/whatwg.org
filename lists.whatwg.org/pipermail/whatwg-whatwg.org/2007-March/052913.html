Assuming you have commercial reasons for supporting HTML 5 (which I 
suspect you do, otherwise you wouldn't be here) then having Ogg 
specified gives you a commercial reason to support it.

If that's not a commercial reason, then what would be a commercial 
reason? If everyone else implemented it?

&gt;<i> That's an attempt to force the issue by fiat.
</I>
But any specification for anything could be described as &quot;an attempt to 
force the issue by fiat&quot;. That' just loaded language.

Why don't we all just go away and implement what we think is best for 
HTML 5, and then put a spec together after the fact? Then we wouldn't be 
forcing any issues, and there would be no &quot;fiat&quot;. But we all know how 
well this approach to standards works.

&gt;<i> No matter what the spec. says, if broad support became a reality, then 
</I>&gt;<i> yes, it may be in our commercial interests.  
</I>
So Apple's strategy is to wait and see what codec everyone else 
implements, and then implement that one?

&gt;<i> And at that point there 
</I>&gt;<i> would be many companies using the codec in a money-making way, with 
</I>&gt;<i> 'pockets', and we'd be clearer about the likelihood of IPR challenges.
</I>
There are plenty of such companies already, as another poster has 
pointed out.

&gt;&gt;<i> If you have nothing against Ogg or Theora, and your &quot;interest in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multi-vendor multimedia standards is deep and long-lasting, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interoperable, and very open&quot;, and other parties have said that a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> baseline codec for video needs to be open and (as far as can be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discerned) patent and royalty-free, then surely your position must one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - You don't actually want a baseline codec in the spec - i.e. you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't actually have a commitment to interoperability
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we have a strong commitment to interoperability in each spec. on its own 
</I>&gt;<i> right
</I>
So what is your plan for promoting interoperability among 
implementations of &lt;video&gt;?

&gt;&gt;<i> - You do want a baseline codec in the spec, but you are happy for it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be someone other people can't implement - i.e. you don't actually 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a commitment to multi-vendor multimedia standards
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone *can* implement the codecs we implement;  they may choose not to, 
</I>&gt;<i> for commercial reasons (e.g. they don't like the license)
</I>
Oh c'mon, that's a ridiculous definition of the word &quot;can&quot;. How exactly 
&quot;can&quot; the KDE project implement a codec in Konqueror which requires 
royalties? How &quot;can&quot; the Mozilla project implement such a codec without 
removing the redistributability of Firefox?

Yes, browsers &quot;can&quot; implement such codecs if they stop being open source 
and freely redistributable. Just as the W3C &quot;can&quot; have lots of cool 
ideas in their specs if they changed the patent policy to not require 
royalty-free licences. But most people wouldn't accept that as a 
reasonable definition of &quot;can&quot;.

&gt;<i> Until someone starts using the Ogg family to make money, and in such a 
</I>&gt;<i> way that any possible IPR owners consider it in their business interests 
</I>&gt;<i> to start enforcing their IPR, the situation remains in question.  We 
</I>&gt;<i> have nothing against these codecs, but we are not currently feeling like 
</I>&gt;<i> being the guinea-pig...
</I>
Other posters have commented on this better than I.

&gt;<i> - we'd an HTML specification which is clear and interoperable on the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML level, and is in a similar position to the img tag on what may be 
</I>&gt;<i> embedded (it mentions only examples)
</I>
As another example of specifications requiring support for other 
specifications, SVG viewers are required to support both JPEG and PNG:
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/conform.html#ConformingSVGViewers">http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/conform.html#ConformingSVGViewers</A>

And I haven't seen anyone writing standards like &quot;Yes, we support SVG, 
but not the bit which says we need to support JPEG and PNG&quot;.
