<PRE>This is maybe off-topic to some degree.

What are the DRM constraints of this format?
I only ask as your organisation is embarking on an MS-DRM fueled  
online media project, and I am curious as to the position of this codec.

thanks

</I>&gt;<i> Having been pointed at this discussion by Christian, I thought I'd  
</I>&gt;<i> let you know a bit more about where Dirac is as a royalty-free open  
</I>&gt;<i> source codec. We're certainly very keen for Dirac to be considered  
</I>&gt;<i> as one of the supported video formats.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dirac has been in development for 4 years. In compression terms  
</I>&gt;<i> it's about twice as efficient as MPEG2, competitive with H264 and  
</I>&gt;<i> VC-1 and substantially more efficient than Theora. The Dirac  
</I>&gt;<i> sourceforge site contains a full specification of the system which  
</I>&gt;<i> is very nearly complete. A subset of this, relating to professional  
</I>&gt;<i> profiles for TV production, has already been proposed to the SMPTE  
</I>&gt;<i> for standardisation as VC-2. Assuming that there are no roadblocks  
</I>&gt;<i> in this process, we intend to submit the rest of the Dirac system  
</I>&gt;<i> as VC-3 (or whatever number they're up to) towards the end of the  
</I>&gt;<i> year. So this time next year, there is a good chance that Dirac  
</I>&gt;<i> will be an international, royalty-free SMPTE standard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we started Dirac, our intention was that the Dirac software on  
</I>&gt;<i> the website could be developed to build a real-time system.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, it proved difficult to make a system that could be a  
</I>&gt;<i> reference codec for testing the specification/draft standard and  
</I>&gt;<i> which had real-time optimisations. So in conjunction with Fluendo,  
</I>&gt;<i> we started the Schrodinger project (<A HREF="http://schrodinger.sf.net">http://schrodinger.sf.net</A>)  
</I>&gt;<i> which is a real-time, multi-platform implementation of Dirac being  
</I>&gt;<i> developed in parallel with the Dirac software. This isn't quite  
</I>&gt;<i> finished yet, but we will have a compliant alpha release in the  
</I>&gt;<i> next month or two. It will be alpha because although it will do  
</I>&gt;<i> real-time encoding and decoding in software, it won't compress all  
</I>&gt;<i> that well. The Dirac site software is being maintained as a  
</I>&gt;<i> reference and demonstrator system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our aim then is to do a beta release of Schrodinger by the autumn  
</I>&gt;<i> using all the encoder optimisations in Dirac, so by the end of the  
</I>&gt;<i> year we should be &quot;there&quot; in terms of having a really good,  
</I>&gt;<i> efficient real-time encoder and decoder. Third parties can start  
</I>&gt;<i> designing implementations when the spec is finalised at version 1.0  
</I>&gt;<i> in only a couple of weeks from now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have been developing Dirac hardware as well. Hardware for the  
</I>&gt;<i> professional applications will be on sale in a very few weeks, and  
</I>&gt;<i> we're developing a prototype hardware HDTV encoder too.
