Yeah, and the work to get good functionality into the &lt;video&gt; element
obviously can and should go on without having to worry about codecs at all.

Once the implementation work starts the topic of codecs will inevitably
matter again and I hope this won't lead to a media-format fragmentation
that hinders interoperability.

&gt;<i> It would be tempting to go into a discussion of the IPR concerning the

</I>
You're right.

&gt;&gt;<i> And to make matters worse you of course need a MPEG audio codec, too,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which adds to the overal costs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> well, you could match an mpeg video codec with an audio codec from
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere else, technically.
</I>
Yeah, but that'd mean you'd come up with a &quot;Frankenstein&quot; format that is
neither free nor a standard of any kind. However, you're just pointing
out the technical possibility.

&gt;<i> I think the example of SVG (a 'markup' language) having a codec
</I>&gt;<i> requirement that 3GPP then had to explicitly write-out is instructive. 
</I>&gt;<i> The attempt there didn't work.
</I>
Well, if 3GPP chose to write out a required format they obviously wanted
to violate the spec without getting blamed for violating it ;)

In case of WHATWG, which primarily is &quot;just&quot; Apple, Mozilla and Opera I
guess such spec-mangling should be unnecessariy, especially if the spec
only mentions special formats as an optional thing.

Personally I fear that once &lt;video&gt; is out in the wild without a free
base format getting promoted Microsoft sooner or later will join the
party with a Windows Media only implementation and effectively sabotage
the WHATWG efforts of interoperability without even having to take the
blame for ignoring the base format. That's just a theoretical
possibility, but I think it doesn't harm to &quot;harden&quot; the spec against
such &quot;hacks&quot;.

Actually the current &lt;audio&gt; draft requires user agents to support PCM
in a .wav container (that's way stronger than what can be found in the
&lt;video&gt; section). I guess your points apply there, too?
