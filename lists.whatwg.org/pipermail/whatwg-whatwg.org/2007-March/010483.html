Even interoperability at the API and markup level would be a huge  
step forward relative to the current state of web video. While also  
having a single universally implemented codec would also be good,  
that may not presently be feasible.

This is true of hardware audio decoders, but not hardware video  
decoders, which use dedicated circuit blocks. If Ogg suddenly became  
popular it would likely be a several year pipeline before there were  
any hardware decoders.

&gt;<i> Case in point: my Nokia N800 certainly does not play H264.  The

</I>
Most Flash video uses on the Sorenson Spark codec which is based on H. 
263. This is a much less processor-intensive codec than more modern  
options, but also gives worse compression. H.264 has been approved as  
one of the codecs for 3GPP so you can expect it to be supported by  
mobile devices in the future. Modern hardware decoders these days  
support H.263, MPEG-4 Part II, and H.264. These also happen to be the  
3GPP codecs.

&gt;&gt;<i> We are very sympathetic to the desire for interoperability, and we

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure that if everyone else starts supporting Theora and Vorbis

</I>
Apple doesn't currently support WMV, despite it being a popular  
format for video on the web, so I'm not sure that follows.
