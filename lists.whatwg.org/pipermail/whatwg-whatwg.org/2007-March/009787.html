<PRE>Hi Julian,

&gt;<i> What, except efficiency, prevents you from parsing the whole file with 
</I>&gt;<i> an XML parser? If it parses, it is XML. Otherwise it isn't.
</I>
This approach would suffer from the opposite problem: documents that the 
author intended to be treated as XML would be treated as HTML if there 
was a single well-formedness error anywhere in the document.

The resulting behaviour would be quite confusing for users, as an XHTML 
file containing SVG and MathML content would suddenly stop working if a 
tag was left unclosed. However, since the file would probably still 
parse correctly as HTML, especially if the unclosed tag was something 
like &lt;img&gt; or &lt;br&gt;, the user might not get any error messages relating 
to the well-formedness error. Instead, they could get error messages 
relating to the unknown SVG and MathML tags in their &quot;HTML&quot; document.

Our heuristics are an attempt to guess the intentions of users. 
Specifying an XML declaration or other XML-specific content is an 
indication that the document should be treated as XML. In the absence of 
any XML-specific signs, a .html file really has to be treated like a 
HTML document, even if it would potentially be successfully parsed by an 
XML parser. Any other policy would appear to lead to very confusing 
behaviour.

Best regards,

Michael
