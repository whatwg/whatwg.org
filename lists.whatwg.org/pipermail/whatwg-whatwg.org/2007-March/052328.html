Looks like you got your wish.  This thread has been popular.

I'm sure we could get him to notice.  He's already asked developers for
another way to opt in.

The problem will be if W3C wants to keep DTDs or otherwise shoots down
compatibility with WHAT's HTML 5 DOCTYPE.  Then using it as the switch
will only apply to WHAT's HTML 5.  Another solution will have to be made
for W3C's HTML 5.  This is why I've been suggesting a switch that didn't
rely on the markup.

If they differ, I doubt that will be a good solution for them.  Further, I
assume we're still a ways off from the final draft (but I can't find a
road map).  I'm wondering if they had something now if some change to IE7
could be made.  If they did, at least, they couldn't ignore the issue and
push it off on until developers found a solution for them.

It'd make more sense if we could get Chris Wilson in on the discussion.  I
assume they asked for something other than the DOCTYPE as a switch for a
specific reason (&quot;some other way to opt in&quot;, were his words).  I'd really
like to know exactly what he expected.  Wish I was at that event.
