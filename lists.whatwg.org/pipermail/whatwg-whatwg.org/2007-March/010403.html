This seems like a problem that can be solved by content negotiation.

Content negotiation has the advantage that it doesn't potentially add 
extra requests to find the right representation: the browser just says 
&quot;here's what I support&quot; and the server does the best it can, or returns 
an explicit &quot;I don't have anything for you&quot; message. (&quot;Not Acceptable&quot;)

However, as others have pointed out, MIME types only represent the 
container format and not the codecs inside, so content negotiation would 
need to be extended to somehow allow audio and video codecs to be 
presented in addition to container formats. Note that this problem 
applies when doing object-style fallback on the &lt;video&gt; element too, as 
you need to specify something in the type=&quot;...&quot; attribute to avoid the 
browser having to request every representation in turn to reject it.
