This element would be extremely useful to someone with a screen reader.
It would create an implied UA hook for &quot;skip to main content&quot;, for one.
With multiple postings within a page, it would create a reliable way of
&quot;skimming&quot; the main sections (by reading the first bit of content on each
posting), even when there are no headers or when the postings themselves
have internal sectioning and headers (especially if those are inconsistent).

For printing, the &lt;article&gt; element would make it easy to cut out
extraneous content and print just the main content of a web page.
