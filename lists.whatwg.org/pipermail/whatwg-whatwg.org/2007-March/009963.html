I don't think anyone wants to trash the DOCTYPE in light of the  
current landscape.  The problem is that the IE team wants ANOTHER  
switch to turn on Super-Standards Mode.

&gt;<i> If DTD is out, bring back the deprecated &quot;version&quot; attribute that it

</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/html&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All attributes optional, obviously.
</I>

That's a great idea.  That solves not only the versioning system, but  
could solve the IE Super-Standards Mode switch (though I don't think  
the &quot;mode&quot; attribute needs to be there... no one wants to  
specifically render in quirksmode, I'd think).  Again, my worry is  
that W3C doesn't implement it.  My header idea would go above W3C's  
and WHATWG's heads.  That means that it doesn't have to be in any  
published spec (and it shouldn't be, IMO).  It's just something to  
tell IE how to treat the content (the same way we tell browsers to  
render as XML, charsets, caching, etc).  There is really no reason it  
needs to be in any specification.  However, if we can solve the  
missing versioning problem, it could be dual purpose (assuming W3C  
implements it in their recommendation).
