But that's circular reasoning. &quot;We don't have a commercial reason to 
implement Ogg or Theora, and so we'd rather not have the HTML spec give 
us a commercial reason.&quot;

If the HTML spec said that Theora support was a SHOULD, and the other 
browser manufacturers were implementing it, then you would have a 
commercial reason.

If you have nothing against Ogg or Theora, and your &quot;interest in 
multi-vendor multimedia standards is deep and long-lasting, 
interoperable, and very open&quot;, and other parties have said that a 
baseline codec for video needs to be open and (as far as can be 
discerned) patent and royalty-free, then surely your position must one 
one of the following:

- You don't actually want a baseline codec in the spec - i.e. you don't 
actually have a commitment to interoperability

- You do want a baseline codec in the spec, but you are happy for it to 
be someone other people can't implement - i.e. you don't actually have a 
commitment to multi-vendor multimedia standards

- You do want a baseline codec in the spec, and want it to be one 
everyone can implement - i.e. you are happy for Ogg Theora (or another 
codec with a similar IP position, such as Dirac) to be it

That seems to logically enumerate the possibilities. Or have I missed 
something?

(Just in case there's any concern, I speak only for myself in this post, 
as someone keen to see logical debate on this issue, and not for my 
employer.)
