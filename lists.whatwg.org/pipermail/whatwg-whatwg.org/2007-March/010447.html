<PRE>As my last word on this pointless bit of the thread, I'm going to  
spell it out....

Your thread:

</I>&gt;<i> content fill the entire viewport. (Or not, if they want to continue  
</I>&gt;<i> to display captions, or ads, or a set of links).
</I>
I was agreeing with Martin and disagreeing with you.
Fullscreen video should be like that of a media player, think VLC,  
Quicktime, DVD Player(on the Mac), Cyber-whatever, you choose  
fullscreen, all you get is the video.

I think it should be like this, as you are telling the &lt;video&gt;  
element to go fullscreen and *not* the page.
That's my opinion.

</I>I hope with this last comment you are attempting to be as humerous as  
I was when I made the IE quip.
