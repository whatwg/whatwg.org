If you watched and listened to the Yahoo! talk[1], you'd notice the amount  
of documents on the web employing the CSS1Compat mode (&quot;standards mode&quot;)  
today. According to Chris Wilson, it's about half of the web[2]. That's a  
lot of backward compatibility to pay attention to when you change  
something as serious as the DOM. The only way to not break 50% of the web  
is to invent a new mode that gives the IE developers a blank sheet they  
can begin to draw on. Improving on the legacy, proprietary DOM just isn't  
feasible, imo.

</I>
First of all, IE doesn't understand XHTML, so they can't really behave  
badly with it. Second, this is not giving them an excuse. This is giving  
them a way out of the mess they've created with their proprietary DOM.

Currently they have managed to pull themselves partly up from the mess  
they created with the proprietary CSS implementation, but while they did  
that, the web noticed the effort and learnt about &quot;standard mode&quot;  
(CSS1Compat) and now they can't improve CSS1Compat without breaking almost  
half of the web. That's why &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; can be

unrepresentative for the web as a whole.
