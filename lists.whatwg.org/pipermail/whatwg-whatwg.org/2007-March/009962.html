<PRE>I don't care about DTD, but DOCTYPE is established, so it seems strange to
trash it in favor of something new when the benefit is questionable (as
far as I can tell).  It is also evident to me that there needs to be some
kind of versioning--consistent rendering shouldn't be a moving target.

If DTD is out, bring back the deprecated &quot;version&quot; attribute that it
replaced.  Assuming there is only one version of HTML 5.0, the following
would work:

&lt;html version=&quot;5.0&quot; mode=&quot;strict&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/html&gt;

All attributes optional, obviously.

-Matt

&gt;<i> Browsers render in quirksmode by default.  That's been established.
</I>&gt;<i> At this point WHATWG has already rejected DTDs in DOCTYPE and seems
</I>&gt;<i> pretty set on not including it.  I myself would rather have some type
</I>&gt;<i> of versioning (DTD or otherwise) in the DOCTYPE.  All I've heard from
</I>&gt;<i> WHATWG is that they don't really even like the DOCTYPE.  If browsers
</I>&gt;<i> didn't use DOCTYPE as the standards mode switch, DOCTYPE probably
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't even be in WHATWG's HTML 5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no versioning system, there is no way to specify an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;alternate standard.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure most people have heard the saying &quot;Choose your battles.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Fighting for DTDs or some other type of versioning in the DOCTYPE in
</I>&gt;<i> WHATWG's spec is not a fight that can be won as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i> Having some method to tell people what spec an author is using can be
</I>&gt;<i> won.
