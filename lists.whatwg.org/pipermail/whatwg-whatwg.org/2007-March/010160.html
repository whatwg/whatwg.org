Wow, what a lot of feedback on video! I've added a &lt;video&gt; element, with 
basic features, but really what we need is feedback from video experts.

In the meantime, here's replies to the comments I got. I haven't quoted 
all the e-mails, since many said the same thing or went in circles (well, 
they did! sorry!), but if I missed anything, let me know, and I'll address 
it separately.


ON THE NEED FOR A &lt;video&gt; ELEMENT

</I>
Agreed.

I agree that we should provide the building blocks to build video players. 
I don't understand what you mean by #4 above though.

I have added such an element and its corresponding API (influenced by the 
other feedback received) to the specification. Thank you for the proposal 
and implementation experience!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can't such an API be provided for &lt;object&gt; elements that reference video?

Feedback from browser vendors is that overloading &lt;object&gt; is hard. The 
poor state of &lt;object&gt; implementations tends to support this argument.

Well, if we design our own element for a specific purpose (video) then we 
know what the parameters are, so we can use attributes.

Wouldn't this be better served by just having specific elements like &lt;img&gt;

Could you elaborate on the use case for this? Since the author will have 
the complete data on his end, there doesn't seem much use for actual frame 
capture on the client.


&gt;<i> Also... when implementing UIs, it's useful to have a &quot;toggle()&quot;

I took your suggestions into account when desiging the API. I got feedback 
from a number of people (including some off-list from people who didn't 
want to express their interest publicly), some of which was contradictory, 
so the proposed API doesn't have everything you asked for. Let me know if 
there's anything that you think is missing that you really wanted.


&gt;<i> .loop, .startpos

Regarding the idea of default UI, I agree that it would be useful on the 
long run. The problem is one of feature creep; with just the API we have 
already added a lot, adding a UI on top of that is asking for 
interoperability problems. Baby steps are probably wise here.

I've made the spec allow a UI if it doesn't interfere with an 
author-provided one.

ON THE CODEC

</I>&gt;<i> that should make everyone happy.
</I>
A number of other people said similar things about Ogg Theora.

For now, the spec says that UAs SHOULD support Theora for video and Vorbis 
for audio, and SHOULD support the Ogg container format (it's not a MUST 
because some vendors may have legal reasons why they can't or won't 
support it, and there's no point making them non-conforming when they have 
no choice in the matter).

</I>&gt;<i> I think it'd be cool if the video element *just* supported theora.

Supporting only one encoding is not going to fly: you can't stop browser 
vendors from adding features; and you want to allow the standard to evolve 
over time.

It doesn't have to be out of scope (HTML5 is assuming CSS and JS, for 
instance).

Henri cited my boss earlier in this thread as saying that YouTube uses

Google Video allows original format download if the uploader enabled it,

</I>
(Other people made similar comments or mentioned an &lt;audio&gt; element in 
passing.)

We already have an Audio API, I'm not sure it makes much sense to have an 
&lt;audio&gt; element. What's the use case? Audio is either asynchronous or 
orthogonal to the presentation in most media. We need a &lt;video&gt; _element_ 
because in visual media, visual content has a place relative to the other 
content; but in aural media, aural content under the control of the page 
itself does not have such placement (if it's music, e.g., it can be played 
in the background, and if it's content, then you would alternate between 
playing it and playing the content of the rest of the page; in neither 
case would you simply treat the content of the media as inserted into the 
playback stream with no ability to pause it independently of the main 
document content).

Actually the SMIL &lt;video&gt; element is more akin to the HTML &lt;object&gt; 
element than the proposal here. (SMIL &lt;video&gt; is defined to be 
semantically equivalent to SMIL &lt;ref&gt;.)

Actually the SMIL approach only has one kind of object, it just has many
