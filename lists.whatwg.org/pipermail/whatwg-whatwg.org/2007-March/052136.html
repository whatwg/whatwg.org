Amen.

It's really amusing to see people continuing to trot out
matter-of-fact statements dismissing XHTML. Those statements seem
to fall into two basic types that can be paraphrased as either:

  - The only people who author documents in XHTML are naive
    developers/designers who do it just because they have been
    mislead into thinking that it's the cool/right thing to do.

  - The only people who user/serve-up XHTML are pedants who are
    out of touch with browser/implementation realities.

It seems to me that those who make such statements either:

  - are unaware of any useful things that can be done with
    documents other than just displaying them in browsers -- or
    about how having those as well-formed XML can potentially make
    it easier to process them

  - have an agenda that makes them (consciously or unconsciously)
    want to dissuade others from using XHTML/XML (and XSLT, etc.)
    and to instead use alternatives (whatever alternatives they
    happen to personally be promoting)

I don't think anybody can find fault with developers who speak
from experience and say they don't personally use/serve-up XHTML
because for their specific needs they see no value in doing so.

But that's a whole different thing than making matter-of-fact
blanket/wholesale dismissals of XHTML -- statements that imply
that no other sane/hip developer could potentially find value in
use of XHTML.
