Sorry I must be missing something here. As far as I can tell, there is no 
specification related issue here. If the IE team want to introduce a new 
rendering mode they could indeed switch on the doctype. However there is nothing 
we can do to make this happen so there seems little point in discussing it.

I suppose one could argue over whether HTML5 should include the possibility of 
language version information in the document. However, exisiting implementators 
have reported that trying to switch rendering based on such information is 
highly undesirable because of the additional difficulty of development and 
testing. Therefore the spec instead takes the point of view that all future 
development of the HTML language must be backward compatible so that such 
switches are not needed.
