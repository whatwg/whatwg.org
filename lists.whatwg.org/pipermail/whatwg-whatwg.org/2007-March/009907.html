IMHO, predefined classes do not belong in HTML5. The class attribute is
already defined as user-defined, and it should remain that way to avoid
conflicts.

&lt;address&gt; is a poorly understood, rarely-used element because it's
poorly-named. It represents the intersection of &lt;contactinfo&gt; and
&lt;attribution&gt;, which is neither particularly useful nor particularly
related to its name.

&gt;<i> I suspect I could ask the same question of a few other elements as well.

</I>
The meter concept is widely used already (think reviews and ratings).
As long as &lt;meter&gt; provides the necessary stylistic flexibility, it
should be a useful addition to HTML5. If it doesn't, though, or if it
makes styling more difficult than current methods, then it won't be
used much.

Dates are very often marked-up specially.[1] There's even a microformat
design pattern developed to embed ISO representations of the date
without compromising its readability:
   <A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern">http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern</A>
The &lt;time&gt; element is much more appropriate for this than &lt;abbr&gt;.
