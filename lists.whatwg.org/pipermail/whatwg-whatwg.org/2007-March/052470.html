Gareth Hay said:
&gt;<i> Ok, I could understand that approach, with things like &lt;img&gt;&lt;video&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> handled internally.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there then a case for doing &lt;object&gt; properly by specifying a
</I>&gt;<i> replacement, something like &lt;plugin&gt; / &lt;extern&gt;?
</I>
Something that is bugging me over on the W3C HTMLWG mailing list is the
want to drop &lt;acronym&gt; in favor of &lt;abbr&gt;.  I'm emotionally attached to
&lt;acronym&gt;.  I use it a lot, and really do feel like it is semantically
different from &lt;abbr&gt;.  Asbj&#248;rn Ulsberg suggest replacing both with
&lt;short&gt;. [1]  The idea was a relief because it made the tag MUCH more
generic and (now that I think about it) could have more accurate and
broader references (e.g. microformats use &lt;abbr&gt; for shorter date format,
but &lt;short&gt; would make more sense).

The problem is that &lt;short&gt; is not backwards compatible, and it kills off
two elements at once.  What we need to do, instead, is disconnect from our
internal definitions of what a tag is, and reuse it to serve as what it
ought to have been called to be semantically correct.  So, I'll just have
to get over the idea that &lt;abbr&gt; really just means &quot;the string in here is
a shortened version of a longer string&quot; and not &quot;the characters in here
are a shortened version of a long word.&quot;

In much the same way, &lt;object&gt; is now associated with &quot;media other than
images (even though object will do images).&quot;  Instead of killing it for
better semantics, backward compatibility be damned, we need to change our
thinking to: &lt;object&gt; means &quot;a file that needs a plugin object to play.&quot; 
We'll still be able to play video and show pictures using the object tag. 
We'll need that for backward compatibility.  But, we should start using
&lt;video&gt; to play video once HTML 5 is finalized and use object for playing
video only as a fallback until browsers understand &lt;video&gt;.

If we drop and change elements just because we think another would be
semantically better / cooler, we'll end up looking like XHTML 2.  We don't
want to be there, I promise.
