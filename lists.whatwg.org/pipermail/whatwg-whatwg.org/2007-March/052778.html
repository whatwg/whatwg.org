Why does it not follow?
There is no definitive answer on the legality of this, the answer  
would come from lawyers, of many different regions, of which this  
list has none, so it is out of scope.

Ok, so in risk analysis terminology, it is a risk to seek no legal  
advice on a legal topic, to reduce that risk we should get the input  
of as many different qualified legal persons from as many different  
regions as possible.

Not only is that costly, but is out of scope of this list and spec,  
again.

To be honest, I don't have the time to debate silly points with you,  
this is the 2nd day it has happened.
It was *very* clear from my original message that my view was to  
avoid this issue entirely. You have picked one-liners, and  
deliberately mis-understood the email for the benefit of trying to  
make yourself look clever and me inferior.

I'll help you out, I'm an idiot, you are god.
Move along please.
