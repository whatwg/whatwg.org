The pain of having things that &quot;everyone knows&quot; are needed to make a useful HTML 
reading device but are not documented as such. A specification is documentation 
both of the language and what needs to be done to implement a UA to read it and 
I see no reason to arbitarily limit the scope to those parts that can be 
expressed in pure markup. As I mentioned there is also the problem of vendors 
punting on supporting parts of formats that everyone else supports. SHOULD 
requirements in HTML provide a little extra leverage when reporting these 
deficiencies as bugs.

In the case of image formats it's probably not overwhelmingly important (only 
because &quot;everyone knows&quot; what is needed; in the case of audio and video I think 
it is very important) but I can't see how it's harmful in the way you suggest.

In any case this discussion is probably not very useful.
