Sorry. Some of us use devices where full screen is um... 800x480. And
the reason I choose to use full screen is not because I want content
to randomly shift to some magical playback mode. It's just because I
need to see more of the content (not less!).

Please don't hurt my users (they're using Opera in case you're
curious). It's bad enough that my screen can sometimes be closer to
800x220 (that's basically full screen + find + location + vkb on the
770/n800). [The exact pixel value is probably off by 2.]

&gt;<i> [The only problem might occur if there was an OS whereby every app was
</I>&gt;<i> always &quot;full screen&quot;, and so such a function would make no sense.]
</I>
I think instead of saying &quot;full screen&quot; here, you should have said
&quot;maximized&quot; since as it turns out, there are at least 3 meanings for
&quot;full screen&quot;, and overloading them seems to cause a lot of confusion
:<i>(.
</I>
On the 770/n800, apps are always maximized. They're either maximized
with no borders (classical full screen), or they're maximized with
fairly wide borders (something like . The only resizing cases happen
in things which for the most part *shouldn't* be sent to web pages
(because the results are really bad :( ). Unfortunately this is mostly
a design decision by some &quot;UI Engineers&quot; in some other group and the
Input Method developers (IMEs really shouldn't cause window resize, it
should float, but I'm not in control of that group ...).

&gt;<i> Whether switching to CSS &quot;projection&quot; is the right thing to do I'll
</I>&gt;<i> leave to the CSS experts, but I do think there should be an event.
</I>
Gareth later asks how many devices have fullscreen modes w/ F11
bindings. The Nokia 770/n800 use F6 (yes, they clearly didn't research
web browsers before they picked it, but there is a control panel thing
to configure it) [there's also of course a button on the device that
switches to full screen, but he seemed to be particularly curious
about f11...].
