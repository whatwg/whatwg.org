I love advices of hiring other people when they are accompanied by
money orders.  :)

I think your point of view is valid somehow but a bit idealistic.
Is valid because it is better for UA to know up front what it 
needs to parse : HTML, XHTML, SVG, etc.  

It is idealistic because, say, if you will put following in 
your .htaccess: 

AddType foo/bar .html 

it will do nothing on your site (you can try).
This setting is managed by httpd.conf of the whole
Apache server (if I recall this correctly).
(and ForceType may not work at all on 
servers of your type)

Trust me there are many practical needs where
self descriptive document is highly desirable.

Think about this: 
All UAs will correctly present file
some.png even it contains jpeg bits. 
Even if server reports image/x-png content-type 
for it. 

It is very old tradition in software design - 
all file formats contain identification of the
content type in some form - usually first 256 bytes
is enough to determine type. So why html should be an 
exception of this rule?
