I have a hard time believing what I am reading here.  A new video tag 
cannot 'replace' flash support unless Adobe wishes it.  Apple has 
neither power or desire to stop people implementing the video tag on 
any platform, and indeed the whole point in helping develop open 
standards is tyhat we want there to be broad support and 
interoperability.  In many places, we openly encourage companies to 
implement standards, or we open-source software to make it easy 
(webkit, Darwin Streaming Server, to name but two).  Our interest in 
multi-vendor multimedia standards is deep and long-lasting, 
interoperable, and very open.

Really, conspiracy theories are out of place here, please.

I am glad we agree on that!

Agreed as well.

</I>
Yes.  I re-iterate;  we have nothing aganist the Ogg or Theora 
codecs;  we just don't have a commercial reason to implement them, 
and we'd rather not have the HTML spec. try to force the issue.  It 
just gets ugly (like the 3G exception).
