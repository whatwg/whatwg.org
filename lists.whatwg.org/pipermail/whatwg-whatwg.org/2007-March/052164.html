HTML5 will make it easier to make valid HTML/XHTML hybrid documents  
by legalizing certain XML-specific constructs in HTML and defining  
their behavior in a compatible way. You'll be able to avlidate your  
document as both HTML and XHTML, though there still may be some risks  
of different behavior.

So I think it's unfair to accuse this particular group of not wanting  
to solve the problem.

Maciej
