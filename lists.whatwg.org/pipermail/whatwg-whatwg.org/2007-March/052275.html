It's tempting to think that browser makers will get it right the first
time, but I'm not sure I believe it.  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; might introduce
headaches when Microsoft or Mozilla or somebody realize they've had a bug
in their rendering engine for a couple of years that people depend on now.
 Does that DOCTYPE now become &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML STRICT&gt;?  What happens then
when HTML 6 is introduced?

&gt;<i> HTML5 doesn't need such a rendering mode flag because it doesn't introduce
</I>&gt;<i> incompatibilities (by design).

Sure, but can you guarantee that also for HTML 6, HTML 7?

&gt;<i> As a rule, versioning is a very bad design strategy. Implementors are

</I>&gt;<i> browser vendors have supporting just the one browser (or one-and-a-bit,
</I>&gt;<i> with quirks mode), I would hate to force them to support, over the years,
</I>&gt;<i> dozens of different versions.
</I>
Versioning is a great strategy if implemented well.  Any reasonable
implementation would have a base rendering engine and then browser
differences would extend off of it.  A new version would mean you change
only what differs between versions.

Like products, browser makers could set a cut-off date for new support
requests for older versions of HTML.  For example, when HTML 7 comes out,
browser makers wouldn't be obligated to correct HTML 5-specific bugs
anymore.  They would support, at most, maybe two versions (one primary,
one secondary).

In effect, I'm suggesting a structure like this:

--Base rendering engine
  |
  +- HTML 4 quirks mode
  +- HTML 5 (renders HTML 4 strict as well)
