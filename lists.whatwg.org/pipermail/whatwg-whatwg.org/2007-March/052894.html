I think the first reason is more likely.  The dominant players in 
3GPP are network operators and equipment vendors, and the AAC patent 
owners are (to my impression) very much both a minority and less 
powerful.

The AAC patent owners are, for the most part, organizations that do 
R&amp;D for license -- that's their business, and it's perfectly 
respectable.  They develop good technology and understand that 
without licenses they don't have a business.  Just my personal 
opinion, you understand;  I don't see anything wrong with this 
business model, and indeed I think it benefits the industry.  (There 
are other business models around patents which we need not elaborate, 
which I dare say many of us would have a harder time defending).
