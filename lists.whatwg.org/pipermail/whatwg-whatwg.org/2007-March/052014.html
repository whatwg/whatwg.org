I was thinking about this the other day. There seems to be no way of 
distinguishing the case where you want to hand the data from a URL to an 
external program (e.g. Word files), and you want to hand the URL itself 
to an external program (e.g. streaming audio).

Not sure if a solution to this is in scope for WHAT-WG...

&gt;<i> Currently an issue with supplying height and width for video content

</I>&gt;<i> the media and any player chrome.
</I>
That's the equivalent of:

yvideo + ygui = ytotal

where yvideo is defined in advance by the video file, and ytotal needs 
to be known in advance. The only way that's possible is for ygui to be 
fixed across all platforms etc.
