   I don't really care for predefined classes. Classes strike me as
being an extension mechanism to HTML, so it makes little sense to me to
have their custom semantics enshrined in a specification.

&gt;<i> It's not really a question of whether article makes sense. The question

</I>&gt;<i> they're very weak. I do not see a community crying out for this.
</I>
   Well, I for one have use &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt; for essentially the
same thing all the time, so it'd be nice to have for me at least.

&gt;<i> I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think it's going to help anybody all that much, and I'm afraid it's 
</I>&gt;<i> going to end up like address: a poorly understood, rarely used element 
</I>&gt;<i> that's misused more often than it's used properly.
</I>
   I can think of only one way it might be abused:

|<i> In the Time Magazine article &lt;article&gt;It is the Bunny!&lt;/article&gt;...
</I>
   However, considering how little other inline elements of that kind
are used, I doubt this will be a problem.

&gt;<i> I suspect I could ask the same question of a few other elements as well. 
</I>&gt;<i> time and meter come to mind. They at least don't have any obvious 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalents already in the spec, and are obvious enough they perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> won't be frequently misused; but do authors actually need these? Will 
</I>&gt;<i> they use them?
</I>
   I think &lt;time&gt; has a good use case. (Full Disclosure: &lt;time&gt; is based
 on similar earlier concepts I developed.) Meter has use cases, but I
don't know how strong they are. I think &lt;article&gt; has at least as strong
a use case as &lt;address&gt;, but I agree that's not saying much.
