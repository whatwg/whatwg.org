</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Off-hand, the main issue that directly affects reading is that most

</I>&gt;<i> There are more issues with writing: each platform has its own length

</I>&gt;<i> Windows filenames are case-folding (in practice).

Yup; I'm paying attention to those issues.  In previous drafts of the
spec, we handled reading of awkward paths [barring some handling of
invalid code points, where one could enumerate/read files, but perhaps
not really read their exact names], but restricted writing.  I expect
we'll do something similar when we get around to the write cases.  We
can either restrict path creation to what's valid UTF-8, or we could
allow users to try to create arbitrary paths using ArrayBuffers of
bytes.  At any rate, I don't think we're doing anything here that
would limit our options in the future.
