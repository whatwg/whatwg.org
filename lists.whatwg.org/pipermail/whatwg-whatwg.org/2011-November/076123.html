<PRE>I'm trying to better understand the use case for DataTransfer.entries.
Using the example you listed in your first post, if I dragged those folders
into a browser, I'd expect to see File objects with the following names in
DataTransfer.files:
    trip/1.jpg
    trip/2.jpg
    trip/3.jpg
    halloween/a.jpg
    halloween/b.jpg
    tokyo/1.jpg
    tokyo/2.jpg
It seems like with that, a web app could implement a progress meter and
handle subdirectories easily while using workers. What does the FileSystem
API provide on top of that?

Also, if a page caches a DirectoryEntry from entries, does that mean it can
continuously poll the DirectoryEntry to see if the contents have changed to
contain something interesting? That seems undesirable.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  The unsandboxed storage and actual data doesn't belong to origin, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 'origin-specific' concept can be applied to the filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't thought about workers cases deeply yet, but am thinking that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we should prohibit access to the dropped folders from the other pages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than the one that received the drop event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Access to a file should just be limited by whoever has an Entry object
</I>&gt;<i> pointing at it.  The Entry object is essentially a token granting access to
</I>&gt;<i> its associated file(s).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for the entry URLs I'm planning to make the URLs to the dropped
</I>&gt;<i> entries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; namespace (that only contains the dropped files) expire when the page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goes away, hoping this would largely simplify the lifetime and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it's possible to do this correctly, because URLs created with
</I>&gt;<i> toURL have no equivalent to revokeObjectURL.  A long-running page has no
</I>&gt;<i> way to avoid &quot;leaking&quot; these references until the page exits.  Adding a
</I>&gt;<i> revoke method for toURL would essentially turn it into URL.createObjectURL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Needing to revoke URLs when dealing with worker communication also makes it
</I>&gt;<i> very hard for users to get it right.  For example, suppose a Window sends a
</I>&gt;<i> toURL-generated URL to a Worker.  How do you ensure that the URL is revoked
</I>&gt;<i> after the worker has received it and finished converting it back to an
</I>&gt;<i> Entry?  The Worker might be killed (eg. due to CPU quotas) at any time,
</I>&gt;<i> making avoiding resource leaks very hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are just the usual problems with manual resource management, which
</I>&gt;<i> should be avoided if at all possible.  We already have a mechanism that
</I>&gt;<i> cleanly avoids all of this, with structured clone and File.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Off-hand, the main issue that directly affects reading is that most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; non-Windows filesystems can store filenames which can't be represented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; DOMString, such as invalid codepoints (most commonly mismatched
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encodings).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do they appear in File.name in existing .files approach?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a Linux browser to check.  I'm guessing it won't inform us
</I>&gt;<i> much here, since that didn't have to worry about general file access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A naive solution in filesystem approach would be silently ignoring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such files (probably bad) or having in-memory path mapping (would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slightly better).  For limited read-only drag-and-drop cases we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wouldn't need to think about remapping and the mapping could just go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; away when the page goes away, so hopefully implementing such mapping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wouldn't be that hard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are probably some cases that we'll just have to accept will never
</I>&gt;<i> work perfectly, and design with that in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To take a common case, suppose a script does the following, a commonplace
</I>&gt;<i> method for safe file overwriting (relatively; the needed flush operations
</I>&gt;<i> don't exist here):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Create a file with the name filename + &quot;.new&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Write the new file contents to the file.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Rename filename + &quot;.new&quot; to filename, overwriting the original file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a useful case: it's real-world--I've done this countless times--and
</I>&gt;<i> it's a case where unrepresentable filenames affects both reading and
</I>&gt;<i> writing, plus the auxiliary operation of renaming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose the mapping approach could work here.  Associate the mapping with
</I>&gt;<i> the DirectoryEntry containing it, from invalid filenames to generated
</I>&gt;<i> filenames.  Then, if the invalid filename is &quot;X&quot;, and the DOMString mapping
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;MAPPING1&quot;, then this would first create the literal filename
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;MAPPING1.new&quot;, followed by renaming it to the original &quot;invalid&quot; filename
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;X&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (In particular, though, I think it should not be possible to create *new*
</I>&gt;<i> garbage filenames on people's systems, that didn't exist to begin with.
</I>&gt;<i> That is, it should map to the filenames that really exist, not just string
</I>&gt;<i> escaping.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is complex, though, and leads to new questions, like how long the
</I>&gt;<i> mappings last if the underlying file is deleted.  As a data point, note
</I>&gt;<i> that most Windows applications are unable to access files whose filenames
</I>&gt;<i> can't be represented in the current ANSI codepage.  That is, if you're on a
</I>&gt;<i> US English system, you can't access filenames with Japanese in them.
</I>&gt;<i> (Unicode applications can, but tons of applications in Windows aren't
</I>&gt;<i> Unicode; Windows has never made it simple to support Unicode.)  If users
</I>&gt;<i> find that reasonable, it might not be worth all this for the even rarer
</I>&gt;<i> case of illegal codepoints in Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, writing side would have tougher issues, and that's why I started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this proposal only with read-only scenarios.  (I agree that it'd be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good to give another thought about unsandboxed writing cases though)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For what it's worth, I think the only sane approach here is an isolated
</I>&gt;<i> break from attempting to make everything interoperable, and allow the
</I>&gt;<i> platform's limitations to be visible.  (That is, fail file creation if the
</I>&gt;<i> path depth or filename length is too long on the platform; succeed with
</I>&gt;<i> file creation even if it would fail on a different platform, and so on.)  I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is just inherent to allowing this sort of access to real
</I>&gt;<i> filesystems, and trying to avoid it just causes other, stranger problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (For example, if you prevent creating filenames in Linux which are illegal
</I>&gt;<i> in Windows, then things get strange if an &quot;illegal&quot; filename already exists
</I>&gt;<i> on a filesystem where it's not actually disallowed.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  While the URL format for non-sandboxed files has yet to be worked out,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we need toURL to work no matter where the file comes from.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's already the case that an Entry can expire if the underlying file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is deleted or moved;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there's no revocation mechanism for toURL URLs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if toURL URLs to non-sandboxed storage expires with the context it
</I>&gt;<i> was created in (which it would have to, I think), it loses a whole category
</I>&gt;<i> of use cases covered by structured clone: the ability to persist an access
</I>&gt;<i> token.  For example, the spec allows storing a File within a History
</I>&gt;<i> state.  That allows history navigation to restore its state properly: if
</I>&gt;<i> the user opened a local picture into an image viewer app, navigating
</I>&gt;<i> through history can correctly show the files in older history states, and
</I>&gt;<i> even restore correctly through browser restarts and session restores.  The
</I>&gt;<i> same should apply to Entry and DirectoryEntry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Nobody implements this yet, as far as I know, but I hope it'll happen
</I>&gt;<i> eventually.  It's a limitation today, and it'll become a more annoying one
</I>&gt;<i> as local file access mechanisms like this one are fleshed out.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if non-sandboxed toURL URLs are same-origin only, then that also
</I>&gt;<i> loses functionality that structured cloning allows: using Web Messaging to
</I>&gt;<i> pass an access token to a page with a different origin.  (This is much
</I>&gt;<i> safer than allowing cross-origin use of the URLs, since it's far easier to
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally expose a URL string than to accidentally transfer an object.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> File API has already solved all of this by using structured clone.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> it makes a lot of sense to follow its lead.
