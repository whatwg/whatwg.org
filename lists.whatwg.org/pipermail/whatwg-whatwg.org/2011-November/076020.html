</I>I'm having a Duh! moment... I currently wait for the next character, but 
what you describe is also works, and allows the document.write() spec to 
make sense.

</I>&gt;<i> handling.
</I>Each tokenizer state would have to add a rule for CR that said  &quot;emit 
LF, save the current tokenizer state, and set the tokenizer state to 
&quot;after CR state&quot;.  Actually, tokenizer states that already have a rule 
for LF or whitespace would have to integrate this CR rule into that 
rule.  Then new after CR state would have two rules. On LF it would skip 
the character and restore the saved state.  On anything else it would 
push the character back and restore the saved state.

&gt;&gt;<i> Similarly, what should the tokenizer do if the document.write emits half of

</I>&gt;<i> The parser operates on UTF-16 code units, so a lone surrogate is emitted.
</I>
The spec seems pretty unambiguous that it operates on codepoints (though 
I implemented mine using 16-bit code units). &#167;13.2.1: &quot; The input to the 
HTML parsing process consists of a stream of Unicode code points&quot;.  Also 
&#167;13.2.2.3 includes a list of codepoints beyond the BMP that are parse 
errors.  And finally, the tests in 
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/browse/testdata/tokenizer/unicodeCharsProblematic.test">http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/source/browse/testdata/tokenizer/unicodeCharsProblematic.test</A> 
require unpaired surrogates to be converted to the U+FFFD replacement 
character.  (Though my experience is that modifying my tokenizer to pass 
those tests causes other tests to fail, which makes me wonder whether 
unpaired surrogates are only supposed to be replaced in some but not all 
tokenizer states)
Thanks, Henri!
