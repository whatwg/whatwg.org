I don't think I'm understanding your set of steps.

Let me try to clarify:

1. input.value is &quot;foo&quot;.
2. automatic transaction starts.
3. input.value is changed to &quot;hi&quot;.
4. automatic transaction ends.
5. input.value is changed to &quot;foo bar&quot;.
6. input.value is changed to &quot;hi&quot;.
7. undo is called on undomanager.

at this point I don't see a reason we wouldn't want to change the
value back to &quot;foo&quot;. This doesn't seem like a particularly interesting
scenario because the change is perfectly undoable since the value
matches.

Is there a use-case where we wouldn't want the undo to revert the
value to &quot;foo&quot;?

The more interesting scenario that I was concerned about was:

1. input.value is &quot;lot's of text here&quot;.
2. automatic transaction starts.
3. input.value is changed to &quot;lot's of words here&quot;.
4. automatic transaction ends.
5. input.value is changed to &quot;some words here&quot;.
6. undo is called on undomanager.

Here it seems like there is &quot;no perfect solution&quot; since we don't know
if the page would want to revert back to &quot;lot's of text here&quot;, or keep
the &quot;some words here&quot;. Or maybe change to &quot;some text here&quot; (though
this obviously isn't a viable solution since it'll too easily break in
non-trivial scenarios).

If we define that the implementation has to revert the value back to
&quot;lot's of text here&quot; it means that the implementation must store the
&quot;delta&quot; as well as either the whole &quot;before value&quot; or the whole &quot;after
value&quot;. Or store both the &quot;before value&quot; and &quot;after value&quot; and no
delta.

If we define that the implementation should leave the value untouched
then the implementation only needs to store a hash of the &quot;after&quot;
value and the &quot;delta&quot;.

Storing the whole &quot;after value&quot; or &quot;before value&quot; *might* be a lot of
data. Especially if editing a long piece of text and doing a lot of
small edits.

But maybe it's not enough of a problem to worry about. Implementations
do have the ability to compress the values in-memory which will likely
dramatically reduce the amount of space needed, especially for large
bodies of human readable text.
