You neglect to mention that those changes can also be good and what the  
trade off is between the two. I think that most of the time though after  
some initial discussion people are encouraged to either start an email  
thread or file a bug, depending on the nature of the issue. This may not  
have happened in all cases, and in those cases a request for clarification  
can always be made on this mailing list. The changes to the specification  
are all publicly recorded and are actively followed by a number of  
different people.

In case a change is made people disagree with it does not take a long time  
for it to either be reverted or changed to something that accommodates  
even more people. That is my experience thus far anyway. If your  
impression is different it would be good to know what we can do to improve  
the situation.
