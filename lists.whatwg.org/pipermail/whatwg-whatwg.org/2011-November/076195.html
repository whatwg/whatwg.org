I was specifically addressing the issue of what harm can be done. 
Obviously, good changes can come from any source, including benevolent 
dictators and random-number generators.  ;)

&gt;<i> and what the trade off is between the two.
</I>
Sure.  Again, I was pointing out that there _is_ a tradeoff here, not 
just an unmitigated good.

&gt;<i> In case a change is made people disagree with it does not take a long

</I>&gt;<i> accommodates even more people. That is my experience thus far anyway. If

</I>
My &quot;impression&quot; is that following all changes to the specification via 
the revision control system is a pretty large burden, if nothing else 
because there is no obvious way to do it linked from anywhere I can 
find.  Maybe a small set of people &quot;in the know&quot; who got a link from 
someone on IRC are following it, but plenty of people who are trying to 
implement the specification seem to not be on that select list.
