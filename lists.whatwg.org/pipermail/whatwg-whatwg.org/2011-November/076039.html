</I>
I think we agree, then.  My point is that authors should still be able
to use automatic transactions even if they want undo/redo to affect
non-DOM state too, e.g., canvas.  Authors should only be forced to use
manual transactions if they actually don't want the browser to
maintain DOM state.  So allowing unapply/reapply on manual
transactions would resolve this issue.

&gt;<i> Calling unapply/reapply methods for automatic transaction seem like a good

</I>
Okay, great.

&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, thanks. &#160;This is the key point I was missing. &#160;Just so I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Some changes get made in no transaction at all, just a script

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. execCommand(&quot;undo&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It depends. If the DOM changes made in step 2 does not mutates the highest
</I>&gt;<i> node affecting the automatic transaction in step 1, then step 3 succeeds and
</I>&gt;<i> UA undoes every DOM change made in step 1.
</I>&gt;<i> If the DOM changes made in step 2 mutates the highest node affecting the

</I>&gt;<i> transaction but doesn't need to guarantee the states are restored
</I>&gt;<i> completely.
</I>
&gt;<i>From my two simple tests, it looks like this is how WebKit behaves,

&gt;<i> We can't. That's why I have spec'ed the way it is. Keeping the entire DOM

</I>
Okay.  Then I wonder what it is Gecko is doing, though.

&gt;<i> Yeah, it'll be nice if we could define the behavior precisely but then
</I>&gt;<i> again, there's nothing that prevents authors from modifying DOM in any
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary way.
</I>
Right, but at least then it will either work in all browsers or break
in all browsers.

&gt;<i> This is very expensive to implement, and I'll be opposed to implementing
</I>&gt;<i> such a behavior at least in WebKit.
</I>
Okay.

</I>
What does Gecko actually do, roughly?  In my second test from before,
it looks like undo undoes a change to an unrelated part of the DOM,
which suggests Gecko is actually tracking all changes to the DOM:

data:text/html,&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;div contenteditable&gt;Foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var div = document.querySelector(&quot;div&quot;);
getSelection().selectAllChildren(div);
document.execCommand(&quot;bold&quot;);
document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(&quot;bar&quot;));
document.execCommand(&quot;undo&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;

&quot;bar&quot; doesn't appear anywhere in the DOM in Firefox 9.0a2.  How does
that happen, if it's not tracking all DOM changes to undo them?  What
changes does it not track?

&gt;<i> What we should do is to define exactly how the tracking works, and
</I>&gt;<i> what exact operations the browser does to revert a automatic
</I>&gt;<i> transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That way it doesn't matter (from a consistency point of view) what
</I>&gt;<i> changes the page does outside of transactions. All browsers will react
</I>&gt;<i> the same to the &quot;unknown&quot; state of the DOM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, if we say that for each node removed when a automatic
</I>&gt;<i> transaction is created, the browser records that nodes old parent and
</I>&gt;<i> previous sibling. Then we can say that when the automatic transaction
</I>&gt;<i> is undone, the browser checks that the old previous sibling is still a
</I>&gt;<i> child of the parent (unless the previous sibling was null), if the
</I>&gt;<i> test passes, the browser inserts the removed node after the previous
</I>&gt;<i> sibling in the parent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could also remember both the following and previous sibling in
</I>&gt;<i> order to be more resilient against unrecorded mutations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's lots of options here. The point is we should define the exact
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm that the browser should use.
</I>
I'm in favor of any solution that produces consistent results across
browsers.  I think it's a bad idea to leave it unspecified.

There are also attribute changes, and changes to CharacterData data,
and changes to JS expando attributes.
