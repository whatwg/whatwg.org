Yeah. I changed at one point from trying to label which browsers would 
need to change to just labelling which changes affected normative text 
relevant to browsers, because people were complaining that I wasn't 
flagging normative changes so they would be planning changes in an area 
where they used to disagree with the spec, but then the spec changed to 
agree with them and they didn't know.

</I>
Indeed. I often don't even know whether the people asking are browser 
vendors or not, in fact, let alone with which they are affiliated. :-)
