</I>
The purpose of the canplaythrough event (and of the HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA ready state) are to signal to the page author that playback is likely to keep up without stalling.  This seems to me to have a fairly obvious benefits.  

Here's a hypothetical scenario:

Assume a 100% accurate implementation of canplaythrough (in that the UA can predict with 100% accuracy at what time in the future will the final byte of media data will be downloaded.)  Assume magic or time travel if necessary.

In this scenario, a &lt;media&gt; element with with a canplaythrough listener will always begin playing at the earliest possible time and will never stall during normal playback. This is a clear benefit.

&gt;<i> The question I keep running into is *how inaccurate can the browser be
</I>&gt;<i> until the event is no longer useful?*
</I>
This seems to be a Quality of Service issue.  Different UAs will have different implementations of canplaythough at varying degrees of accuracy.  Some UAs will favor a lower possibility of stalling over an earlier start time.  Others may cut closer to the margin-of-error and favor earlier start times.

&gt;<i> There are many ways to approximate download speed, but it quickly becomes
</I>&gt;<i> complicated to maintain accuracy:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - *Throttled downloads:* So as not to unnecessarily download too much
</I>&gt;<i>   data, browsers may postpone its download of the media file after it has
</I>&gt;<i>   reached a comfortable buffer. In this case, how should the download speed
</I>&gt;<i>   be approximated? Should the browser only measure during active downloading,
</I>&gt;<i>   or should the deferring somehow be factored in?
</I>
I think this is a very bad example for your case.  If the browser has decided to postpone further downloading once it has &quot;reached a comfortable buffer&quot;, shouldn't it have already fired a &quot;canplaythrough&quot; event and set its readyState to HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA?  Isn't that the very definition of reaching &quot;a comfortable buffer&quot;?

&gt;<i>   - *Amount of data for accurate bandwidth estimation:* When can the
</I>&gt;<i>   browser feel comfortable with its estimation of download speed? It seems
</I>&gt;<i>   like the browser's calculation would be pretty noisy unless it has at least
</I>&gt;<i>   a few (~5) seconds of data. But the browser won't always have that luxury:
</I>&gt;<i>   for example, if the browser is throttling download under high-speed
</I>&gt;<i>   internet connection, the browser could mostly be downloading in very short
</I>&gt;<i>   bursts, and each burst on its own may not be &quot;long enough&quot; to get a
</I>&gt;<i>   comfortable estimate.
</I>
Again, this is a clear example of a situation where the browser could easily and safely emit a canplaythrough event.

&gt;<i>   - *Inherent inaccuracy*: As I previously stated, the only way to be 100%
</I>&gt;<i>   accurate in firing this event is to wait until the last byte has been
</I>&gt;<i>   downloaded before firing the event. Firing the event at any time before
</I>&gt;<i>   then will *always* be a guess, not a guarantee. Someone can unplug their
</I>&gt;<i>   connection, or move to a stronger/weaker wifi connection, which will
</I>&gt;<i>   immediately invalidate any estimation from data collected before.
</I>
The spec makes it clear that HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA is an estimate.  And this situation makes a more compelling argument to /add/ a 'cannolongerplaythrough' event for use when the UA detects a suddenly bandwidth-limited connection.  For example, with such an event, a page author may decide to switch to a lower-bitrate version of the media file.

&gt;<i> Given the uncertainty of the event's usefulness, and the trickiness
</I>&gt;<i> involved in implementing it accurately, I propose removing canplaythrough
</I>&gt;<i> from the spec if there is not an abundance of compelling cases in support
</I>&gt;<i> of the event. A web developer can implement his or her own version of
</I>&gt;<i> canplaythrough by monitoring progress events and buffered().
</I>
No, a page author cannot.  For example: if progress events stall, a page author cannot tell that the UA has decided to &quot;postpone loading&quot; after reaching a &quot;comfortable buffer&quot;.  The point of the event and the readyState is that the UA has knowledge of media loading and decoding that the page author does not.  The UA is simply in a much better position to estimate whether a media can play though than is the page author.
