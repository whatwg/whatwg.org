<PRE>Hi David,
Thank you for your elaborate replay although you did not really
comment on my proposal but rather proposed something else.

&gt;<i>Why not just issue a TLS 1 certificate?
</I>
I agree with all you things you say about this technology but let me
begin with another, for the WHATWG applicable comment:

==================================================
  The &quot;standards&quot; for PKI provisioning using browsers are in a real mess.
  Xenroll, KeyGen and a JavaScript CRMF do not really make this
  part as simple as it must be in order to challenge passwords.
==================================================

Anyway, my proposal was about offering a &quot;migration path&quot; to other
authentication schemes, as well as improving the current de-facto standard.

Regarding certificates: the provisioning, mobility and pretty proprietary
card schemes (like no preinstalled drivers in Windows) will make this
transition period rather long.  That none of the browser vendors support
digital signatures (in a reasonable way), is another reason why PKI
deployment is hampered.

Personally, I believe PKI will stay marginal [*] until you can keep your IDs
in a mobile phone.  The US PIV card (to take an example), only allows
you to keep a single Federal ID which is not particularly useful for the
Internet where you will continue to have multiple and mostly entirely
independent IDs.

thanx
Anders

*] There are 10M+ of citizens certificates in Europe, but you cannot
use them at particularly many places due to the problems cited.

Internet Explorer 2 and later support it.  Netscape Navigator 2 and 
later support it.  All versions of Opera support it.  All versions of 
FireFox support it.  All versions of Safari support it.  In fact, the 
vast majority of libraries and user agents that support TLS or even SSL 
websites also support TLS 1 client certificates.

When you issue the certificate, most browsers offer a convenient way to 
send it to the client.  It is installed into the local certificate 
store, or potentially a hardware device such as a smart card.  Later, 
the user authenticates to the user agent, and then is given the option 
of providing the certificate to a site that asks for it.  You can either 
issue a certificate specifically for your site, or you can have them go 
get a (freely available, in at least some cases) client certificate from 
a vendor like VeriSign.  These are typically called &quot;e-mail signing 
certificates&quot; or &quot;digital ID's&quot; by the companies that sell them.

There are a couple big benefits here.  First, you are using an existing 
user agent feature, that every user agent is likely to support.  So you 
just have to talk the user through installing the certificate into IE.

Secondly, web server side, it is a radio button in IIS 4 or later (not 
sure about earlier versions), or a single line
