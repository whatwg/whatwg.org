<PRE>Why not just issue a TLS 1 certificate?

Internet Explorer 2 and later support it.  Netscape Navigator 2 and 
later support it.  All versions of Opera support it.  All versions of 
FireFox support it.  All versions of Safari support it.  In fact, the 
vast majority of libraries and user agents that support TLS or even SSL 
websites also support TLS 1 client certificates.

When you issue the certificate, most browsers offer a convenient way to 
send it to the client.  It is installed into the local certificate 
store, or potentially a hardware device such as a smart card.  Later, 
the user authenticates to the user agent, and then is given the option 
of providing the certificate to a site that asks for it.  You can either 
issue a certificate specifically for your site, or you can have them go 
get a (freely available, in at least some cases) client certificate from 
a vendor like VeriSign.  These are typically called &quot;e-mail signing 
certificates&quot; or &quot;digital ID's&quot; by the companies that sell them.

There are a couple big benefits here.  First, you are using an existing 
user agent feature, that every user agent is likely to support.  So you 
just have to talk the user through installing the certificate into IE.

Secondly, web server side, it is a radio button in IIS 4 or later (not 
sure about earlier versions), or a single line in Apache to enable the 
feature.

Thirdly, if the ID becomes compromised, you can issue a revoke request, 
and issue a new ID.  This means the certificate that you issued before 
immediately becomes invalid, and so if the user loses the certificate or 
has it stollen, it takes no effort.

Fourthly, if the computer has a smart card reader (about USD $20) and a 
smart card, the certificate can be installed onto the smart card.  If 
this is done, then the user must provide a valid PIN in conjunction with 
the physical card in order to send data using the identities installed 
onto the card.  This adds a physical layer of security that is not 
possible with a name/password system.

And the worse problem than the number of systems using user id/password 
on a form to authenticate (and not at least using digest) is that many 
of these don't use TLS, and so the password is sent plain text or plain 
text equivalent across the network.  Additiona
