</I>
For traditional HTML elements, IE uses its built-in knowledge of
their content model, along with rules for dealing with malformed
HTML markup.

For other elements the behavior depends upon whether the tag
has a namespace prefix or not.

If the tag doesn't have an XML namespace prefix, then it is
inserted into the DOM as an empty upper case element.

   &lt;foo&gt;     nodeName = &quot;FOO&quot;
   &lt;/foo&gt;    nodeName = &quot;/FOO&quot;
   &lt;foo/&gt;    nodeName = &quot;FOO&quot;

The same is true if you define the XML namespace with the
xmlns attribute e.g.

   &lt;foo xmlns=&quot;<A HREF="http://example.com/ns&quot;/">http://example.com/ns&quot;/</A>&gt;  nodeName=&quot;FOO&quot;

BUT if you use a tag with a previously defined XML namespace
then things are different:

   &lt;f:foo&gt;hello world&lt;/f:foo&gt;

is parsed as a foo element with a text node &quot;hello world&quot; as its
content. The case for the element's tag name is preserved.

if the namespace prefix isn't previously declared then you get:

   &lt;f:foo&gt;    nodeName = &quot;F:FOO&quot;
   &lt;/f:foo&gt;   nodeName = &quot;/F:FOO&quot;

However, the namespace declaration can leave the URI empty, e.g.

  &lt;html xmlns:f=&quot;&quot;&gt;

is sufficient for IE to avoid giving &lt;f:foo&gt; the empty uppercase
treatment.

It isn't sufficient to define the namespace on the element itself
as in the following example:

   &lt;g:fred xmlns:g=&quot;&quot;&gt;smith&lt;/g:fred&gt;

which gets the uppercase empty element treatment. To avoid
that, you need to declare the namespace on the html start tag.

Elements with a declared XML namespace prefix can be styled
with CSS.

Note that my tests were done using a script to walk the DOM
tree and display the results in an alert box.

With a knowledge of the above behavior, web page scripts can
be written clean up the DOM, e.g. placing the tags into the
HTML namespace with a dynamically defined prefix, and fixing
up the content. It's not a show stopper.

&gt;<i> Converting the node name to uppercase also seems like the right 
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do for text/html documents although HTML5 might change 
</I>&gt;<i> bits of that...
</I>
Perhaps.

Another difference between IE and Opera is that Opera includes
the prefix as part of the node name for elements with a previously
declared XML namespace.

None of this is insurmountable by a determined scripter, but we
might perhaps try and aim for closer alignment amongst different 
browsers that is currently the case. I am not advocating that
Opera follows IE's upper case/empty element weirdness, rather
that Opera treat &lt;foo/&gt; as an empty element.
