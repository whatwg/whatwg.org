</I>
The reason being you'd not heard of the hidefocus attribute :-)  or
onfocus=&quot;this.hideFocus=true&quot; if you want to be free.

&gt;<i> In Opera, when keyboard navigation hits this link, focus is removed. Thus
</I>&gt;<i> the link can not be activated from the keyboard and navigation may have to
</I>&gt;<i> start from the top of the document again.
</I>
Right so ignore it.

&gt;<i> We need some prose in a spec that allows a user agent to ignore blur() for
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility reasons.
</I>
Why do you?  there's no prose in any spec which says you have to
support any script etc., and if there is, I would encourage you to
break it anyway, obviously anything that harms accessibility to your
users is something that it is your duty as a web-browser company to
not do.

I can appreciate you'd rather point to some other place and go &quot;look,
look they said it was okay&quot;, but in that case you already have it UAAG
is fine for that.  I don't think it's good to spell out and make
specifications even longer just to give you somewhere to point pretty
deluded authors.

&gt;<i> 'scripts must not alter focus-related issues in a way that hinder keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> operation, and user agents may override any such use of focus-related
</I>&gt;<i> scripting operations.'
</I>
I don't like this, it doesn't define hinder well enough for a MUST,
can't you just take it as read that you're allowed to?

I can't foresee any realistic collateral damage from actually blocking
the behaviour - but if that genuinely is the case, then removing blur
entirely would be a more appropriate solution.

Mostly though I encourage you to continue in the vein of promoting
your user, rather than hiding behind spec's, you've done it so well to
date!

Jim.
