</I>&gt;<i> that the breaks should be dictated by the value of cols (and that if 
</I>&gt;<i> cols doesn't exist, the breaks should be dictated by the size of the

</I>&gt;<i> on to say that this is anyways not a good thing because users have 
</I>&gt;<i> different size displays so everyone's wrapping position would be 
</I>&gt;<i> different, defeating the purpose of client side wrapping).
</I>
With you so far.


&gt;<i> Now, I am really wondering about that whole paragraph, my paraphrasing 
</I>&gt;<i> not withstanding.  First of all, 'defeating the purpose of client side 
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping' begs the question of what is the purpose of .wrap?  It's 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty clearly not something for the client side, right?, since there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no visible difference to the user while working with a textarea (there 
</I>&gt;<i> would be if .wrap=off, but that is not covered here).  So if it's not 
</I>&gt;<i> useful for the client, it should be useful for the server.  How?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ensuring that text is broken up every cols characters is a pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> trivial function (by this I mean that it is trivial to do server side) 
</I>&gt;<i> that does not serve much purpose in having it done on the client side.
</I>
If it's done on the client side, the user can see how it will wrap, which 
is important if it's going to screw up the user's formatting.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, it is very useful information to know what the user 
</I>&gt;<i> was seeing so that what is processed on the server side has some 
</I>&gt;<i> correlation to what the user submitted.  This is the dichotomy between 
</I>&gt;<i> how .wrap has been used so far - either delivering what the user saw 
</I>&gt;<i> (.wrap=hard) or what the user intends to be seen (.wrap=soft), making it 
</I>&gt;<i> useful for both sides.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can't deduce server side what the user saw client side, even 
</I>&gt;<i> assuming you know how wide the textarea is by any other means - the user 
</I>&gt;<i> might not even be using a fixed width font - .wrap=hard serves a very 
</I>&gt;<i> useful purpose here.  And I don't see that the argument is any different 
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not cols has been set.  In addition, there are millions of 
</I>&gt;<i> sites out there with .cols set because it must be (because cols has been 
</I>&gt;<i> mandatory for so long).  These people will be in for a rude awakening 
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, to find out that cols now means something completely different.  
</I>&gt;<i> But I think I'd be even more annoyed as a user, it being as if I was 
</I>&gt;<i> chopped off in mid
</I>
I don't think the &quot;new&quot; behaviour is actually any different in practice, 
is it? It's just a grandfathering of the meaning.


&gt;<i> In short, I have outlined a compelling reason to have .wrap behave as it 
</I>&gt;<i> does on IE6 vs. a passing comment about the purpose of client side 
</I>&gt;<i> wrapping.  In short, I am asking where this most peculiar mandate about 
</I>&gt;<i> .wrap=hard came from and expressing my strong disagreement with what I 
</I>&gt;<i> understand so far.
</I>
I don't understand the difference between what IE6 does and what the spec 
says should happen.


&gt;<i> 2.  As long as I am writing, I may as well ask about another textarea 
</I>&gt;<i> issue that has always seemed strangely absent.  Why is it that there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no way to find out what will actually be transmitted from a textarea.  
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to me that the client (javascript) might be at least as interested 
</I>&gt;<i> in this as the server cgi.  It would be useful to know what row and 
</I>&gt;<i> column one was on in the textarea.  Of course, it is possible to know 
</I>&gt;<i> what row one is on within the .value (because you can figure out where 
</I>&gt;<i> the caret is, and then count preceding \n's), but with wrapping, these 
</I>&gt;<i> two are different, and you don't really know for sure where things are 
</I>&gt;<i> being wrapped.  Therefore, it would be exceptionally useful to have 
</I>&gt;<i> something like .observedValue to reflect what is being seen.  In IE, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think I can figure this out via some range monkeying about (since they 
</I>&gt;<i> allow for rangeHeight (or something like that)), but I am stumped with 
</I>&gt;<i> Mozilla/FF.
</I>
I'm not 100% sure what you're asking for, but we will be adding features 
to control the cursor position in HTML5.

Cheers,
