Yes, if you want to know how this is expected to work I guess you should.  
The benefit is that it might be 8 months between new specs, and 8 days  
between new inventions and people suffering because they have no way to  
use them, and an auto-discovery mechanism that doesn't always rely on  
writing a new spec would be an improvement on that.

&gt;<i> and I can't think of any similar auto-discovery technology that is

</I>
The RDF solution at least provides for a workable auto-discovery  
mechanism. Which means that vendors don't just spend their time chasing  
down other vendors' extensions manually. I'm not sure that the gap between  
the two is worthwhile. In principle I would rather see things invalid than  
magic lists. In practice I suspecting I am making water towards the  
oncoming wind - vendors would do it anyway - which is why I support the  
RDF thing.

(Plus I am one of those people who can write RDF easily, or find a tool to  
do it for me, but cannot stomach anything that says &quot;first just write a  
script&quot;...)

Cheers
