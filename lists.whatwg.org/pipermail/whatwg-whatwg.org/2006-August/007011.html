They wouldn't. That's why authors shouldn't set it more than once.

They're not. Authors &quot;should avoid setting the autofocus attribute on 
multiple enabled elements in a document&quot; means that it is wrong to do so.


&gt;<i> But what, for example, if we have a frameset running with 3 framed html 
</I>&gt;<i> pages, each using autofocus? The navigation could have a site-search on 
</I>&gt;<i> top and the other two could also have essential/important fields (or 
</I>&gt;<i> simply the only ones viable for editing). So it may be a good idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> restrict the autofocus on &quot;parts&quot; of the sites. This would be; identify 
</I>&gt;<i> an autofocus attribute with the element using it and some parent (or 
</I>&gt;<i> grandparent) ID. So if you hover any parts inside this [grand]parent, 
</I>&gt;<i> the focus should be on the child containing the autofocus attribute.
</I>
Well, it depends on the UA, but it is quite possible for the UA to have a 
concept of &quot;focussed control&quot; per-frame, and then the concept of a 
focussed frame, in which case this works fine.


&gt;<i> So wait - this is contradictory !? Well, the easiest senseful of 
</I>&gt;<i> handling autofocus is in my opinion only one per page, period. But if 
</I>&gt;<i> this is going to be widened and fulfilling a certain purpose, I think my 
</I>&gt;<i> other idea might not be too wrong. At least text box/area focus should

</I>
I agree it should just be one-per-page. The spec already disallows more 
than one per page.

Sorry it took so long to reply.
