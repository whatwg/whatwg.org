It's got nothing to do with it's function, you've got an image in the
page, to be accessible a user has to be able to find out what the
image is - unless it's purely decorative where you could have an empty
one - but this is a functional image - so it must have an ALT, there
is no discussion

&gt;<i> Does the image for a checkbox using a standard html need an alt text?
</I>
The standard HTML checkbox is not an image, it's a checkbox...
&gt;<i> So, I'm not sure why you stopped looking after
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>
Because you claimed something was truly accessible, when you'd not
made the first step of ensuring images have ALT text, say, here's an
example which makes  an image used as a checkbox accessible to some
screen readers, and if you put in a lot of other work you could make
it accessible to other people would've been okay, but you didn't you
chose to claim it was truly accessible.

&gt;<i> It seems like something else is bothering you about my message.
</I>
Just the all too common claim of accessibility authors not actually
increasing accessibility just moving it to a different group having
problems.

&gt;<i> In any
</I>&gt;<i> case, I'm only here as a fellow colleague providing food for thought. I
</I>&gt;<i> hope that's not a problem.
</I>
Oh definately not, your work is very useful!  Just don't make the
mistake of over-claiming what you do, the examples are not accessible,
they aren't unfortunately.

&gt;<i>The core is, accessibility is important and
</I>&gt;<i> no doubt there are places where whatwg does things better,
</I>
I don't think the what-wg does a good job of accessibility at all,
there are some good ideas certainly, but there's also a lot of badness
due to the degrading to a whole heap of script that's required in a
number of areas.

Your work on Role is very good, and I'd certainly encourage you to
stay participating in the what-wg.

Jim.
