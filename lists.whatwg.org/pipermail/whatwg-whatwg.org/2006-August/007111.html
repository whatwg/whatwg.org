</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I got a question about &lt;embed&gt;. Firstly, does WhatWG intend to document
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that element and how it works?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Secondly, if so:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Consider an &lt;embed src=&quot;testmovie.wmv&quot;&gt;. Consider that said system has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; plugin installed that can show movies in that format (that is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; video/x-ms-wmv). The plugin can also handle &quot;*.wmv&quot; movies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now, imagine that the server sends a type of text/plain for this file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What should happen?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If text/plain is sent, I expect it to fail unless you have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text/plain plug-in installed. Even then though, the video wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; play because it'd be a text/plain plug-in, not a video plug-in..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, if no type at all is sent ( like if you're loading a local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page that embeds a local wmv file), then I'd say use the extension as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a backup.
</I>&gt;<i> This is inconsistent with how the object tag in HTML 4.01 interprets the
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.  In HTML 4.01, the object tag only receives a content type in
</I>&gt;<i> three cases:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  The content type cannot be determined based on the classid attribute
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  The content type is not provided by the transport mechanism at all
</I>&gt;<i> (note: HTML cannot assume HTTP transport -- it is also transported by
</I>&gt;<i> FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, WebDav and other mechanisms -- content type is a
</I>&gt;<i> concept not supported by some of these, notably FTP).
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  The content type provided by the transport mechanism is incorrect
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My opinion is since the embed tag is a non-standard precursor to the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 4.01 object tag, that if it is supported at all (and it really
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be -- object provides the same functionality and is widely
</I>&gt;<i> supported now), that it should follow the exact same rules as the HTML
</I>&gt;<i> 4.01 standard places on the object tag.
</I>
Making embed do as object ( minus the alternate content of course
since embed is an empty element  and noembed isn't the same) would be
a good idea. I think some things with the object element need to be
sorted out as well though.

&gt;<i> First, HTML is transport independent.  If an HTML file is viewed via
</I>&gt;<i> FTP, for example, there won't be a content-type at all.  You cannot
</I>&gt;<i> assume HTTP + HTML, you have to assume that other newer or older
</I>&gt;<i> protocols could be used to provide the HTML content.
</I>
Point taken. If those cases, use extension or other means to determine
the action.

&gt;<i> Second, many applications and sites are hosted on providers such as
</I>&gt;<i> GoDaddy, Earthlink, GeoCities, AngelFire, AT&amp;T Global Services, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> where the page author has extremely limited control over the server
</I>&gt;<i> configuration, if any control at all.  As a result, the HTML standard
</I>&gt;<i> supports HTTP-EQUIV as a meta tag for overriding or flat out providing
</I>&gt;<i> information that should be in HTTP headers.  This kludge is because of
</I>&gt;<i> these kind of providers.
</I>
True.  The type attribute could be used as a backup in these cases. (
But see my reply to Boris Zbarsky)

&gt;<i> My argument is this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  The embed tag is redundant with the object element, and the object
</I>&gt;<i> element is now widely supported.  New pages should not use embed, they
</I>&gt;<i> should use object.
</I>
I like this idea, but I don't deal with netscape 4.8 etc. I suppose
many still do.

&gt;<i> 2.  If you want to add the embed element to an HTML 4.01 standard, then
</I>&gt;<i> its handling of content type should in every way match the handling of
</I>&gt;<i> the content type by the object tag, because there is no reason why it
</I>&gt;<i> should apply different (more or less) restrictive rules than a directly
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent tag.
</I>
O.K. Syncing object and embed handling sounds good to me. Currently,
they are not handled exactly the same.

&gt;<i> 3.  It should always be assumed that the web server and its
</I>&gt;<i> configuration are outside the page author's control.  HTML standards,
</I>&gt;<i> which are not tied to any specific transport mechanism, should be built
</I>&gt;<i> around that concept.  There should be no differences in behavior because
</I>&gt;<i> of content type, aside from potentially using a XML parser in place of
</I>&gt;<i> the HTML parser by default for an XML data type.  Even in that case, the
</I>&gt;<i> browser should fall back on the HTML parser if it fails (because the
</I>&gt;<i> user isn't the one who made the mistake, and you are penalizing the user
</I>&gt;<i> for using an up-level client -- the user will soon learn to install and
</I>&gt;<i> stick with a down-level client, so that you don't interfere with their
</I>&gt;<i> browsing).
</I>
This is where I myself would like to invoke strict handling ( via some
attribute ) as I might want things to fail if the proper content-type
is not sent.

&lt;embed src=&quot;file.php&quot;&gt; might not do me any good if file.php doesn't
send the right content-type.

I can see something like this:

&lt;embed strict=&quot;true&quot; type=&quot;audio/x-ms-wax&quot; src=&quot;file.php&quot;&gt;

where that would fail if file.php isn't sent as audio/x-ms-wax.

To stress again, I know we don't want to break current handling, but
we definitely need to straighten some things out.

Thanks
