</I>&gt;<i> Note the last sentence stating that :read-only/:read-write and 
</I>&gt;<i> :enabled/:disabled are orthogonal. This is contrary to CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> specifications. As defined in currently available specifications, 
</I>&gt;<i> :disabled and :read-only are _NOT_ orthogonal. See the description of 
</I>&gt;<i> :read-only and :read-write in the CSS3-UI spec[2]:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | 4.1.6. :read-only and :read-write
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | An element whose contents are not user-alterable is :read-only.
</I>&gt;<i> | However, elements whose contents are user-alterable (such as text
</I>&gt;<i> | input fields) are considered to be in a :read-write state. In typical
</I>&gt;<i> | documents, most elements are :read-only. However it may be possible
</I>&gt;<i> | (e.g. in the context of an editor) for any element to become
</I>&gt;<i> | :read-write.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, anything that's not user-alterable is :read-only. But 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;disabled elements&quot; in HTML are clearly not user-alterable, as you can 
</I>&gt;<i> see here [3] (with emphasis added by me):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | In this example, the INPUT element is disabled. Therefore, it _CANNOT_
</I>&gt;<i> | _RECEIVE_USER_INPUT_ nor will its value be submitted with the form.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Selectors specification[4] also fails to define the states as 
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | The :enabled pseudo-class allows authors to customize the look of user
</I>&gt;<i> | interface elements that are enabled &#8212; which the user can select or
</I>&gt;<i> | activate in some fashion (e.g. clicking on a button with a mouse).
</I>&gt;<i> | [...]
</I>&gt;<i> | Similar to :enabled, :disabled allows the author to specify precisely
</I>&gt;<i> | how a disabled or inactive user interface element should look.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Logically, the user cannot alter the contents of an element or form 
</I>&gt;<i> control if the user is unable to select or activate that control. In 
</I>&gt;<i> other words, :disabled is always a subset of :read-only. Therefore, your 
</I>&gt;<i> claims regarding the orthogonal nature of the :read-only and :disabled 
</I>&gt;<i> states are supported by neither CSS3-UI nor Selectors.
</I>
I understand (and agree) that WF2 disagrees with CSS3UI and Selectors 
here. I believe the error is in CSS3UI and in Selectors.

Having them be orthogonal is far more useful to authors. For example, 
imagine the following stylesheet:

   :read-only::after { content: ' (Read-only)'; }
   :disabled { color: gray; }

You wouldn't want all the :disabled fields to suddenly say &quot;read-only&quot; 
just because they weren't relevant. You wouldn't want to have to say:

   :not(:disabled):read-only { ... }

...every time you wanted to style the fields which, when enabled, still 
can't be edited.

I'll see if I can get Selectors updated.


&gt;<i> There is a clear double standard here. I had a problem with the way
</I>&gt;<i> :read-only was defined, that it applied to elements that did not have a
</I>&gt;<i> |readonly| attribute, but you made it clear that I would have to go
</I>&gt;<i> through www-style to get it changes in the CSS3-UI specification before
</I>&gt;<i> getting a related change made in the WF2 spec.
</I>
Well, :read-only has always been intended to apply to everything. There's 
a difference between the basic concept of the pseudo-class and the exact 
definiton of the pseudo-class.


&gt;<i> Yet when you have a problem with the definition of the 
</I>&gt;<i> _EXACT_SAME_PSEUDO-CLASS_, you just change the WF2 spec to produce 
</I>&gt;<i> orthogonally where none existed in the collective W3C specs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you can explain to me how you justify this.
</I>
I'm trying to make the specs be useful to authors.
