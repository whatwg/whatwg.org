   Mozilla is committed to having XBL 2.0 implemented as early as
version 3.0 of Firefox. Apple's WebCore has source code specifically for
XBL, so it isn't unreasonable to think that XBL will eventually be
implemented for Safari and KHTML. Ian Hickson was an employee of Opera
during most of the development of the XBL 2.0 draft, and the joint
Mozilla-Opera position paper sent to the W3C talks about XBL, so there's
some reason to believe that they'll eventually support XBL as well. So,
chances are that only Microsoft won't have XBL 2.0 implemented within
the next couple of years.

   Still, you're right about ease of implementation. The |role|
attribute is easier to implement, but that |class| is even easier
because it's already there.

&gt;&gt;<i> [...] where a proper CSS presentation for the users primary media is

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is almost always the case on the real web.
</I>
   Yeah, the web masters are so lazy that they can't be bothered to add
accessibility via CSS, but they'll be working overtime putting in |role|
attributes using the correct predefined values.

/me rolls eyes.

&gt;&gt;<i>    I don't see a significant difference between |role| and predefined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values for |class|.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh and I'm allergic to predefined class values :)

   I would suggest a strong antihistamine whenever you use a microformat.
