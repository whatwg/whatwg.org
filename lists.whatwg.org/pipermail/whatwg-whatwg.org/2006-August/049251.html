Yes, this would help a lot when writing client-side scripts which modify pages as they are loaded, removing unwanted content such as Flash. Some browsers (Opera) have a mechanism like &quot;User JS&quot; to register a script which runs before every page starts loading. It can register event listeners, but currently there is no way for such script to e.g. prevent loading of Flash. It can only remove all Flash objects in document.onload handler, but by that time some Flash objects might have already started playing.

&gt;<i> If one relied on events not being retroactive (in that they only fire

</I>
With mechanisms such as &quot;User JS&quot;, a script can register so early as to get the event for creation of the root node.
