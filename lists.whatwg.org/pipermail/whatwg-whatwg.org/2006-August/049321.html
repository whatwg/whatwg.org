</I>&gt;<i> 3.6.1
</I>&gt;<i> Item 10. There's a comma missing after '&quot;[&quot;)' and before &quot;a modifier&quot;.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> 3.6.1
</I>&gt;<i> Example in item 11. Double quote missing in '&quot;[n&#183; string'.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> 5.
</I>&gt;<i> Step 5. When XML submission is used, characters that are not XMLChars as per
</I>&gt;<i> XML 1.0 need to be dealt with. I suggest dropping them.
</I>
I prefer converting them to U+FFFD. Dropping characters can be the source 
of very hard-to-debug security problems. Done.


&gt;<i> Also, when XML submission is used, CRLF line breaks on the data level 
</I>&gt;<i> are weird, because the CR would have to escaped in order to preserve it 
</I>&gt;<i> in XML. I suggest using LF line breaks in XML submission. LF line breaks 
</I>&gt;<i> in XML may be serialized as literal (unescaped) LF, CR or CRLF.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> 5.
</I>&gt;<i> Step 5. I think NFC normalization should be applied before using legacy
</I>&gt;<i> encodings as well. E.g. Windows-1252 can encode many precomposed European
</I>&gt;<i> characters but cannot encode the decomposed versions without precomposing
</I>&gt;<i> first. However, in some special cases like Windows-1258 (Vietnamese) it is
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to separate some diacritics from the base characters after the NFC
</I>&gt;<i> step. (But I imagine Windows-1258 encoders do that themselves.)
</I>
I don't see that this is a WF2 problem. It's up to the encoding 
specifications to specify how to encode Unicode characters.


&gt;<i> 5.
</I>&gt;<i> Step 8. What happens if a 204 response changes the character encoding
</I>&gt;<i> metadata? Or Content-Type in general for that matter?
</I>
This is the realm of the HTTP specification.


&gt;<i> 5.2.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Note that a string containing the codepoint's value itself (for example, the
</I>&gt;<i> six-character string &quot;U+263A&quot; or the seven-character string &quot;&#9786;&quot;) is not
</I>&gt;<i> considered to be human readable and must not be used as a transliteration.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the sentiment, but changing that behavior is not
</I>&gt;<i> backwards-compatible.
</I>
Backwards compatible with what? IE's behaviour is broken (there's no way 
to submit a literal &quot;&#9786;&quot; followed by a U+263A character). It could 
even be a security risk in certain instances.


&gt;<i> 5.3. &amp; 5.5.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The submission character encoding is selected from the form's accept-charset
</I>&gt;<i> attribute. UAs must use the encoding that most completely covers the
</I>&gt;<i> characters found in the form data set of the encodings specified. If the
</I>&gt;<i> attribute is not specified, then the client should use either the page's
</I>&gt;<i> character encoding, or, if that cannot encode all the characters in the form
</I>&gt;<i> data set, UTF-8.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think sending UTF-8 to unsuspecting form handlers is worse that losing some
</I>&gt;<i> unencodable characters. Sending UTF-8 to programs that don't expect it amounts
</I>&gt;<i> to garbage in which increases the global amount of garbage out.
</I>
If they haven't specified an encoding, then using the page's encoding is 
as much a guess as using UTF-8. The server hasn't said what it expects, it 
should use the encoding metadata in the submission to deal with this.

The sooner we switch to a full-UTF-8/16 solution the better.


&gt;<i> 5.4.
</I>&gt;<i> Can the presence of the accept-charset attribute be considered non-conforming
</I>&gt;<i> when the XML submission type is specified?
</I>
Seems like a fine thing to warn about. I don't know if it should be an 
error; what if the page changes the enctype around?


&gt;<i> 5.6. and elsewhere
</I>&gt;<i> Minor typographical nit: Em dash used with spaces on both sides as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> either em dash without spaces or en dash with spaces.
</I>
Em-dash without spaces is ugly, and en-dash is too short. IMHO. :-)


&gt;<i> 5.6.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The value of the enctype attribute must be dispatched using a case-
</I>&gt;<i> insensitive literal comparison.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;case-insensitive&quot; marked up as code. Still worried about considering 
</I>&gt;<i> Turkish i conforming.
</I>
Yeah... I think HTML5 might switch pure-ASCII attributes' case-folding to 
ASCII-only. Not sure yet.


&gt;<i> 6.1.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;(Even if importing into a text/html document, the newly imported nodes will
</I>&gt;<i> still be namespaced.)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But will tagName return in upper case?
</I>
-&gt;HTML5. (Yes. But that isn't specced yet.)


&gt;<i> General DOM
</I>&gt;<i> Will localName return the name in lower case in HTML DOM?
</I>
-&gt;HTML5. (Depends on whether the Document is an &quot;HTML&quot; or &quot;XML&quot; Document.)


&gt;<i> 6.1.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The following script has only one possible valid outcome:&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Valid&quot; used loosely. :-)
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> 7.10.
</I>&gt;<i> Does &quot;mirror&quot; mean &quot;reflect&quot;?
</I>
Changed to reflect, but note that neither term is well-defined in WF2.


&gt;<i> B.
</I>&gt;<i> Is the presence of inapplicable attributes in the input element non-
</I>&gt;<i> conforming? (I think it would be useful to make inapplicable attributes
</I>&gt;<i> non-conforming.)
</I>
It should warn, for sure, but I don't know that making it non-conforming 
is useful. As mentioned previously, I don't like making things 
non-conforming unless they are very clearly wrong.
