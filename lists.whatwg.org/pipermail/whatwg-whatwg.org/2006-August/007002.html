<PRE>There are a lot more roles than what you listed, and they are all mapped 
via desktop accessibility APIs such as MSAA and ATK to the assistive 
technologies. So we already have truly accessible DHTML widgets that are 
key navigable and usable with 3rd party tools such as screen readers.

If you're interested in what roles are supported, check out the docs:
<A HREF="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML#Simple_and_complex_examples">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML#Simple_and_complex_examples</A>

You have to do something like &lt;div role=&quot;wairole:alert&quot;&gt;....&lt;/div&gt; or 
&lt;span role=&quot;wairole:tab&quot;&gt;
There is no other standards-based way to make these types of widgets 
accessible in a web page today. I don't think it's a narrow use case. 
Look at the huge numbers of websites that are trying to become more like 
desktop applications.
