That's a purely &quot;human factor&quot; though. There's no reason you can't use &lt;div 
class=&quot;bigredtext&quot;&gt; and style it with an Aural style sheet. Or indeed with a 
visual stylesheet to present the text in small, blue letters. It's just /likely/ 
to make your document harder to understand if you do that.

 &gt; In fact,
&gt;<i> a presentational class name might be applied to elements that have

That would be an acceptable use of class. It would probably be poor design 
(because later the author might want to restyle the elements separately) but 
that's not our problem. Indeed a nominal requirement that class names map to 
semantics would be impractical; there exists no 1:1 mapping between the 
semantics of an element and the way it is presented within a particular document 
(e.g. I might want 7 &lt;h2&gt; elements 3 being styled with a left float and red text 
and 4 being styled with a right float and green text).

Any attempt to formalise the class attribute beyond &quot;it takes arbitrary values&quot; 
is imho misguided and doomed to failure.
