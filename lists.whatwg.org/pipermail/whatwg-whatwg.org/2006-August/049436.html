<PRE>Hello Ian,

One use case, from my point-of-view, was to allow for non-networked form
submits

For example, if you had a computer or device that did NOT have a network
connection, and you did not have (and did not want to have or cannot have) a
local  HTTP server running.  Then you could use such a data URL to make
things happen.

Also, with the use of data URL's for &lt;img&gt;'s, for &lt;object&gt;'s, and for
&lt;form&gt;'s, you could have an entire HTML-based application contained in
exactly one file.

Which is again useful in situations where you do NOT have network access.

Also, it is useful to have the entire HTML-based application contained in
&quot;one file&quot; when you want to put it into some other XML document.  (Like in
RSS, Atom, or XMPP/Jabber.)


What really motivated me to think about it is that is that I was writing a
blog post about how to create HTML e-mail signatures with hCards built into
them.

I wanted to include a form to help them do this.  The reader would fill in
their name, e-mail address, etc, and it would generate HTML code they could
use for their HTML e-mail signature.

However, I didn't want the form to make a request back to my server.
(Because people could be reading this in their feed reader were they have
the blog post cached from my feed.)  I wanted it to be entirely self
contained within the blog post.

So, as you mentioned, one solution is JavaScript.  However, JavaScript has a
couple problem.  #1: It complex.  (Yes... I'm lazy :-)  )  #2: Not all blog
readers will allow the execution of JavaScript.

Also,... another reason against making a call on my server....  The blogging
software I wrote works by having each blog post be a file.  Each file is an
Atom document.  Not an Atom &lt;feed&gt; though.  But an Atom &lt;entry&gt;.  (And yes,
it is legal to have an Atom &lt;entry&gt; as the root element.)

So having everything in one file is easier and simpler for me.  (And again,
yes, I'm lazy, and like things easy.)  Preferably, I'd like to do &lt;form&gt;'s,
&lt;img&gt;'s, and &lt;object&gt;'s with data URL's.


See ya
