Fixed.


&gt;<i> 1.9. (and elsewhere)
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that &quot;conformant&quot; is not generally accepted in dictionaries.
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;Conforming&quot; is.)
</I>
It's commonly used these days.


&gt;<i> 1.9. &amp; 2.5.
</I>&gt;<i> The spec does not have a spec-wide clarification on what is meant by a
</I>&gt;<i> character. Also, maxlength is defined in terms of code points and not
</I>&gt;<i> DOMString (UTF-16) code units. Is this intentional?
</I>
Yes and yes.


&gt;<i> 1.10. &amp; 2.3.
</I>&gt;<i> Cursory testing indicates that IE6 does not do Unicode case folding when eg.
</I>&gt;<i> checking the value of the type attribute on the input element. This suggests
</I>&gt;<i> an interop problem. As far as document conformance goes, can the values that
</I>&gt;<i> browsers are required to compare case-insensitively be required to be lower
</I>&gt;<i> case or at least confined to the Basic Latin block (i.e. no Turkish i)? Any
</I>&gt;<i> difference between HTML and XHTML?
</I>
I'd like to avoid specifying this in detail for WF2 since it is not really 
specific to forms. I'm going to address this more low-level stuff in HTML5 
in detail.


&gt;<i> 1.12.
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion (considering RFC 2616), servers should not require a Referer
</I>&gt;<i> header in a &quot;trusted host&quot; check but should only reject requests with a
</I>&gt;<i> Referer header that has an undesirable value.
</I>
That would enable attacks from hosts that use SSL.


&gt;<i> 2.3.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;User agents may establish a button in each form as being the form's default
</I>&gt;<i> button. (This should be the first submit button in the form, but UAs may pick
</I>&gt;<i> another button if another would be more appropriate for the platform.)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is problematic, because then the author cannot know which button will be
</I>&gt;<i> treated as the default button.
</I>
Why is this a problem? It's the user that needs to know the default 
button, not the author.


&gt;<i> 2.4.
</I>&gt;<i> How is stepping over leap seconds expected to handled? Suppose the value of a
</I>&gt;<i> datetime field is 2006-01-01T00:00:00Z and the step has been set to one day
</I>&gt;<i> (86400). The user takes a step down. Is the correct value then
</I>&gt;<i> 2005-12-31T00:00:01Z or 2005-12-31T00:00:00Z? I have no idea how this issue is
</I>&gt;<i> usually dealt with in software. How can libraries released at different times
</I>&gt;<i> have the same notion of the discretionary decisions of some bureau? To me it
</I>&gt;<i> seems that leap seconds are a can of worms and more trouble than they are
</I>&gt;<i> worth, but sadly they seem to be an official part of UTC.
</I>
Generally speaking computers ignore leap seconds at the user layer. I've 
made the spec explicitly ignore leap seconds.


&gt;<i> 2.4.
</I>&gt;<i> Does ISO 8601 define how its flavor of the Gregorian calendar rolls backwards
</I>&gt;<i> all the way to, say, 1900 or 1 AD?
</I>
No idea, I haven't got a copy of it.


&gt;<i> 2.4.
</I>&gt;<i> If the specified value of the value attribute does not conform to the datatype
</I>&gt;<i> and is not &quot;&quot;, is it proper to consider the document non-conforming? (I'd say
</I>&gt;<i> this would be useful for quality assurance of the initial stat
