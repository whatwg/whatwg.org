   I would agree with that, although I think we disagree as to what the
error is.

&gt;<i> Having them be orthogonal is far more useful to authors. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> imagine the following stylesheet:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    :read-only::after { content: ' (Read-only)'; }
</I>&gt;<i>    :disabled { color: gray; }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You wouldn't want all the :disabled fields to suddenly say &quot;read-only&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> just because they weren't relevant. You wouldn't want to have to say:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    :not(:disabled):read-only { ... }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...every time you wanted to style the fields which, when enabled, still 
</I>&gt;<i> can't be edited.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll see if I can get Selectors updated.
</I>
   Please go back and address the concerns that I posted on www-style in
detail when you update Selectors.

&gt;&gt;<i> There is a clear double standard here. I had a problem with the way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :read-only was defined, that it applied to elements that did not have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> |readonly| attribute, but you made it clear that I would have to go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through www-style to get it changes in the CSS3-UI specification before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting a related change made in the WF2 spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, :read-only has always been intended to apply to everything. There's 
</I>&gt;<i> a difference between the basic concept of the pseudo-class and the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> definiton of the pseudo-class.
</I>
   That's the point. The :read-only pseudo-class should never have been
defined as applying to everything. It should apply to markup that has a
defined read-only state. The text-based input of a control is not
comparable to a |contenteditable| region of HTML. For instance, if you
can't edit the markup of an &lt;input&gt; element, but you can edit the text
in the control, then at the markup level, the control is read-only, but
the actual control contents are read-write. Conversely, what if you have
an &lt;input readonly&gt; control as the child of an element with
|<i>contenteditable| enabled? In this case, the markup actual says
</I>&quot;readonly&quot;, but it might still be considered read-write because the
markup can be changed.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yet when you have a problem with the definition of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _EXACT_SAME_PSEUDO-CLASS_, you just change the WF2 spec to produce 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> orthogonally where none existed in the collective W3C specs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps you can explain to me how you justify this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to make the specs be useful to authors.
</I>
   Having to style control elements using selectors like
&quot;html|input[readonly]&quot; as opposed to &quot;:readonly&quot; doesn't strike me as
more useful for authors. Also, note that for stuff like XForms, you can
end up in a situation where there's no clear way of styling a
&quot;read-only&quot; control, since the &quot;read-only&quot; property may not exist
directly on the element. Of course, if we start talking about other XML
languages here, we're getting off topic...

   (Gee, I was really angry when I wrote that previous message... :) )
