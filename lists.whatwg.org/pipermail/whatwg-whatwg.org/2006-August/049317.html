<PRE>I'll think about it what you say about the checkbox. Honestly it hasn't 
come up before. You're right in that if images are turned off then this 
example is no  longer accessible to sighted users.

While screen readers aren't the only important thing, they are 
important. If we put an alt text there then I find it likely that the 
screen reader will speak redundant, confusing information, at least in 
Firefox 1.5  I'll have to think about how we can avoid that.

Thanks for bringing up the point.
