Show me a spec that says that in a normative way. It is merely a &quot;best 
practice&quot;. Class names, in general, are meaningless and meaningful class 
names should not be part of the core specification.

&gt;<i> I have yet to hear an

</I>&gt;<i> |role| can, especially given the allowance in the HTML 4.01 spec for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;general purpose processing&quot;.
</I>
Of course, if you plan to put all the semantics of a document in the 
class names, we could do away with many elements. Do you object to &lt;div 
class=&quot;h1&quot;&gt; as a replacement for &lt;h1&gt;?

&gt;&gt;<i> Otherwise, both authors and machine processors 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be easily confused by it.
</I>
Eh?

&gt;<i>    The values for |role| are nothing more than a new set of class names,
</I>&gt;<i> and there is nothing preventing the user from putting in unidentified
</I>&gt;<i> |role| values for presentational purposes and then styling them via CSS
</I>&gt;<i> using attribute selectors. So aside from being mildly harder to select
</I>&gt;<i> from CSS, |role| values are potentially no more semantic than |class|
</I>&gt;<i> values.
</I>
Authors can misuse anything. &lt;h1 style=&quot;font-size:12px; 
font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;This is the main text of my document put in a 
heading so that search bots think that it's really relevant and useful&lt;/h1&gt;.

&gt;<i>    However, let's assume that people would only use semantic values in
</I>&gt;<i> |role|. What becomes of |class|? We use it only for styling? That won't
</I>&gt;<i> work, because HTML is supposed to be semantic.
</I>
We use it for it's purpose - to provide hooks to enable presentational 
languages to couple to arbitrary groups of elements on a page. This kind 
of non-semantic hook is _necessary_ so that the temptation to abuse the 
semantic elements is greatly reduced.

&gt;<i>    So what we end up doing is replacing |class| with an attribute named
</I>&gt;<i> |role| that has more rules but otherwise does the same thing.
</I>
No. We add an attribute which conveys specific semantics (&quot;this element 
is being used as a UI widget of a particular type). We standardize some
well-researched values for that element that are applicable to the needs 
of non-visual UAs in the real world.
