Could you elaborate on the use cases? Are there a lot of use cases on  
the Web now that force site author to hack awkward JavaScript widgets  
themselves? Can't they continue using those hacks for uses cases that  
are not mainstream like airline reservations?

&gt;<i> The most obvious is a conversion widget between calendars - there

</I>&gt;<i> date is julian and one gregorian to find the right dates for

</I>
Does an October Revolution visualizer need to use for widgets as  
opposed to e.g. a table of text dates side-by-side? Besides, for  
tracking revolutions around February in 1600, 1700, 1800 or 1900 that  
hack won't work right.

&gt;<i> because there are use cases where that is necessary for things that  
</I>&gt;<i> will happen in the next few months...
</I>
What cases are those?

&gt;<i> If the goal of WF2 is to provide something simple for people to  
</I>&gt;<i> use, then it ought to be a preferable option for people like  
</I>&gt;<i> history teachers with basic web skills, or the support guy or smart

</I>
I've seen software professionals struggle with the Gregorian  
calendar. Even if they were able to deal with the Gregorian calendar,  
I very much doubt that history teachers with basic Web skills or  
support guys are up to the task of dealing with computer processable  
dates in any case other than the Gregorian calendar starting with  
1930s or so (without timezones :-).
