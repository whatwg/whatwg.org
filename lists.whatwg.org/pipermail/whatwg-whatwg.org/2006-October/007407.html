Well, as you later point out, we don't want to lock ourselves in. But I 
agree that it is important to consider the common case first.

Yeah, you're probably right.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For example I may want first to find set of classes I'd like to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if (y) find += &quot; class2&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; getElementsByClassName(find);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but with varargs function it's really cumbersome:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if (x) find.push(&quot;class1&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if (y) find.push(&quot;class2&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; switch(find.length)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  case 1: getElementsByClassName(find[0]); break;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  case 2: getElementsByClassName(find[0],find[1]); break;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can just do:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   if (x) find.push(&quot;class1&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   if (y) find.push(&quot;class2&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   document.getElementsByClassName.apply(document, find);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...which seems much better to me than using a string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's the first time I see apply method used. I couldn't find it in 
</I>&gt;<i> ECMA262-3 nor in WA1.0. Can you give me a hint where it's defined?
</I>
ECMA262 Edition 3 section 15.3.4.3.


&gt;<i> Why is that better than using string?
</I>
It probably isn't. It seems, though, that one option (suggested by Brad 
below) is to accept a string or an array, thus:

   if (x) find.push(&quot;class1&quot;);
   if (y) find.push(&quot;class2&quot;);
   document.getElementsByClassName(find);

This would probably be easier to read.

True. It seems slightly better (since then you can easily pass an array) 
to make the function accept a string or an array.


&gt;<i> &gt; We could also have a getElementBySelector() method, but it seems that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it would be best to let the CSSWG define that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The specification already defined getElementsByClassName(). So, why not 
</I>&gt;<i> getElementsBySelector() too? Or this can be better handled via XPath 
</I>&gt;<i> expressions?
</I>
Now covered by the following W3C spec:

That seems reasonable, although I could see someone wanting to just pass 
an element's &quot;class&quot; attribute value to the method directly, and have it 
work even if the attribute has multiple class names in it.

I don't think authors would be that confused, to be honest. But it's hard 
to check really. They already have to deal with this in CSS...

I understand the distinction you're making, but the method name is already 
ridiculously long and making it longer (especially by just pluralising it) 
is probably just going to confuse authors.

This is incorrect (even assuming you meant .foo and .bar). All three would 
be blue in the example above. (You later pointed that out, I am just 
replying here for completeness' sake!)

window.open() takes a comma-separated list, if I recall correctly.

Well, we can do it if we allow the array version to not be split, because 
then we have a way of doing it in the theoretical case you raise.

Actually, Ric's point was incorrect. Order is defined not to matter,

A number of people gave use cases. I'd like to thank everyone for your 
input; I agree with the need for this feature.

The modified version of the model you proposed that I describe above (with 
a single string argument splitting on spaces, and an array version that 
doesn't split) supports both space-separated (the common case) and 
non-space-separated (the hypothetical case), so I think it's a good 
solution.

Note that space-separated is the common case here, and thus our primary 
concern should be for space-separated classes.


&gt;<i> 2. getElementsByClassName() must be *binding language* agnostic. That 
</I>&gt;<i> is, we cannot assume that it will only be used in JS. It should be

</I>
Yeah, varargs is now out. We're still going to use overloading, I think, 
but in non-overloading-supporting languages, the string version can just 
be dropped.

Note that JavaScript is the main language here, and thus our primary 
concern should be for JavaScript.


&gt;<i> 3. getElementsByClassName() should succeed as expected in the simplest

</I>
Agreed.

But I think people would also expect:

   document.getElementsByClassName(element.className)

...to work, even if |element| has multiple classes.

Actually browsers have all been busy implementing their own extensions as 
experiments for the past few years, and the WHATWG spec draws heavily from 
those experiences. For example, the following features were invented 
outside the WHATWG and later came to be added to the WHATWG spec: 
&lt;canvas&gt;, contenteditable, tabindex, drag and drop, and the text selection 
APIs. And the following features are based heavily on features that were 
prototyped in browser implementations: &lt;datagrid&gt;, &lt;command&gt;, server-sent 
events, and cross-frame messages. I'm probably missing others.

</I>&gt;<i> 2.) <A HREF="http://shadow2531.com/opera/js/getElementsByClassName/001.html">http://shadow2531.com/opera/js/getElementsByClassName/001.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now this one supports the same 2 types, but the string handling is 
</I>&gt;<i> different. The string is space-separated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, with this second example, you can do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;aaa&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> document.getElementsByClassName([&quot;bbb&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot;]);
</I>&gt;<i> document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;bbb ccc&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (The second 2 produce the same result. The 3rd one might just be cleaner 
</I>&gt;<i> in certain situations)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm liking what options the second example provides. (not necessarily

</I>
Very interesting. Thanks for doing these experiments, implementation 
experience is always welcome.


&gt;<i> Do you agree with the string being space-separated? It seems to make 
</I>&gt;<i> sense at least for html where a classname can't have spaces.
</I>
Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense.

Only in other languages, not in HTML, MathML, SVG, or any of the other 
languages that exist today. It's a theoretical problem, it can't happen 
(that I know of) today. In fact, because it's theoretical, I've stopped 
worrying about it. But the current proposal does support it.
