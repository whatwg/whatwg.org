Dear Channy,

I may have been careless but I could not find the spec of the activeX control
(or similar) that is what I refer to as the proprietary solution.

I may also have confused Korea with Hongkong who definitely claimed that
their scheme requires an NDA.  The same goes for the Australian scheme
which is not public.

BTW, the Swedish and Norwegian government's signature systems are also
secret since they are developed by banks.
