Footnotes and endnotes are identical in content in the context of a  
print document and I am not certain how they'd differ even  
presentationally on a web page, so yes, I think those can be  
considered identical in terms of markup.

&quot;Sidenotes,&quot; though, is ambiguous. If the term refers to footnotes  
that happen to be placed beside the text, then yes, they're identical  
semantically to footnotes. But &quot;sidenotes&quot; may also refer to &quot;pull  
quotes&quot; or &quot;callouts&quot; -- some small piece of text to be highlighted  
rather than additional explanatory information of the sort that would  
appear in a sidebar or footnote. Or, if &quot;sidenote&quot; refers to what is  
usually called a &quot;sidebar,&quot; then we're talking about something that  
is both more extensive than the typical footnote and of greater  
importance relative to the main text -- its position on the side of  
the page is rather than at the bottom is not merely presentational  
but is indicative of the weight of the content. Moreover, a callout  
or sidebar is not a numbered or marked reference and need not be  
referred from a precise location within the text -- whereas a  
footnote or endnote relates to a specific word, sentence, or  
paragraph, a sidebar/callout/pullquote relates more vaguely to a more  
general section of text, or in the case of some sidebars, to the full  
article.

So while markup for footnotes/endnotes could be standardized fairly  
easily (in as much as writing standards is ever easy), I don't even  
know where I would begin to define sidenotes semantically. As I've  
used them in print and on the web, they'd need to relate to (1) a  
header, and therefore to the section of text underneath it; or (2) a  
paragraph, list, or other defined block of text. But a sidebar might  
need to contain block-level formatting (and even multiple paragraphs  
and potentially headers), which means it couldn't be placed inside  
one of those elements.

I don't know how many people would actually use magazine-style  
sidebars and callouts on the web -- I would, and probably a lot of  
newspaper and magazine publishers would, if there were a convenient  
way to do it. (I already do use pullquotes, but with some complicated  
markup to make them, I hope, accessible and semantically meaningful.)  
On the other hand lots of web authors do and would use footnotes/ 
endnotes. So I am not sure how much effort it would be worth putting  
into markup for sidebars/callouts.
