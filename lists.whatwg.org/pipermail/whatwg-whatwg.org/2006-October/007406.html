You can do this already using the getImageData() and putImageData() 
methods -- get the area that you want to affect, modify the device pixels 
you want to affect, and then redraw it.

</I>
There's no reason UAs can't already do this optimisation. In fact, it 
would be better for UAs to do these optimisations than for authors to have 
to remember to do them.

I agree with David Hyatt's comments here.

</I>
The two use cases that Benjamin gave were both cases where you'd switch in 
the middle, actually.

I strongly agree with this. But I don't think we should realy go there, 
certainly not at this stage of the game.

That's a good reason not to add them at all.

</I>
I would imagine that most people would rather implementations were both 
fast and had high quality all the time.

Exactly true.
