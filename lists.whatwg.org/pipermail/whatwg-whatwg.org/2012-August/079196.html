This would misinterpret filenames as UTF-8.  For example, &quot;&#40692;&#38632;.jpg&quot; in a
CP932 (SJIS) ZIP is also legal UTF-8.  This would happen even though the
user explicitly specified an encoding, and even though UTF-8 is
exceptionally rare in ZIPs (all Windows ZIP software outputs filenames in
the user's ACP, and many don't support UTF-8 at all).

I hate to argue against defaulting to UTF-8, but very few ZIPs are actually
UTF-8.  CP1252 as a default will at least often be correct, but UTF-8 will
almost never be.  (The only straightforward way I know to create a ZIP with
UTF-8 filenames is with a *nix commandline client, and most Windows
software won't understand it.)

var reader = new ArchiveReader(blob, &quot;Windows-1252&quot;);
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this fails, this filename/file will be excluded from the results.

There's no need.  Decode with proper error handling, as specified in the
Encoding spec: <A HREF="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/encoding/raw-file/tip/Overview.html.">http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/encoding/raw-file/tip/Overview.html.</A>
This will give placeholder characters (U+FFFD); even if the whole filename
comes out unreadable, the file can still be read, selected from a list,
shown in a thumbnail view, and so on.  Lots of uses aren't dependant on
filenames.


&gt;<i>  &gt; It should be possible to get the CRC32 of files, which ZIP stores in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the central directory. This both allows the user to perform checksum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; verification himself if wanted, and all the other variously useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things about being able to get a file's checksum without having to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read the whole file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> can we have 'generic' archive API supporting CRC32?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Do you actually have any concrete plans for other archive formats?  The
only others commonly used are TAR and RAR.  TAR is unsuitable for
non-archive use (you have to scan the whole file to construct a file list),
and RAR is proprietary.

You could design a checksum API that uses the algorithm for a particular
format, but that's severe overdesign if it never supports anything but
ZIP.  I wouldn't worry about this.
