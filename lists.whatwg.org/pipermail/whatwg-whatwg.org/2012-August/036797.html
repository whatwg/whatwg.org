</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We briefly brainstormed some ideas on #whatwg earlier tonight, and one

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This has several key characteristics that I think are good:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - it's long, so people aren't going to want to type it out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - it's long, so it will stick out in copy-and-paste scenarios
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - it's emminently searchable (long unique term) and so will likely lead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    to good documentation if it's adopted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - the &quot;generator&quot; part implies that it's for use by generators, and may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    discourage authors from using it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - the &quot;unable&quot; and &quot;required&quot; parts make it obvious that using this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    attribute is an act of last resort
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking as a validator contributor-implementor, I support the addition of
</I>&gt;<i> this attribute, with the &quot;generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt&quot; name or
</I>&gt;<i> at the very least with the characteristics of the name Hixie outlines here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, I intend to implement experimental support for it in the
</I>&gt;<i> validator.nu engine relatively soon. Henri has also stated that he thinks a
</I>&gt;<i> related proposal from Ted O'Connor for a similar attribute but with a
</I>&gt;<i> different name (&quot;relaxed&quot;) &quot;would be eligible for implementation in
</I>&gt;<i> Validator.nu if the proposal were adopted by the HTML WG&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that Ted would be amenable to updating that proposal to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt&quot; instead of &quot;relaxed&quot;, so I think
</I>&gt;<i> we have convergence on agreement for adding this attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This attribute would be non-conforming except when provided in markup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generated by user agents that find themselves with an image and no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suitable alt=&quot;&quot; text. It would be a third option in the &quot;Images whose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contents are not known&quot; section of the spec. It would be mentioned in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Guidance for markup generators&quot; section, along with some text about using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the other two alternatives when the image in question is the center
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of attention on the page (as in the Flickr case), rather than using this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new attribute. It would replace the &quot;generator&quot; exception in the &quot;Guidance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for conformance checkers&quot; section. The note in the &quot;generator&quot; section
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I support all those changes. I can't speak for Henri on all those points,
</I>&gt;<i> but note that Henri has also recently indicated he's agreeable to dropping
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;generator&quot; section -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;I agree that &lt;meta name=generator&gt; is a bad solution both because it
</I>&gt;<i>   tries to repurpose existing syntax in a way that's not expected by the
</I>&gt;<i>   current generators of the syntax and because of its lack of
</I>&gt;<i>   granularity.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we do this, I think we should commit to revisiting the issue in a year
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or two, to examine what impact this is having on Web pages: is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute used in inappropriate ways? Is it used badly more than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctly? Are validator users more or less happy? Most importantly, are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alt=&quot;&quot; texts overall better or worse? Have any generators started using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the attribute rather than outputting bogus alt=&quot;&quot; values?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. I support making having some kind of &quot;trial period&quot; like what you
</I>&gt;<i> describe, or a year or two or 18 months. If we do that I would prefer that
</I>&gt;<i> the spec include some kind of note/warning making it clear that the
</I>&gt;<i> attribute is experimental and may be dropped or changed significantly
</I>&gt;<i> within the next two years based on analysis we get back during that time.
</I>
This sounds reasonable I guess.

Would it be possible to combine this with the linter complaining about
all controls (links, buttons, form fields) have markup that yield a
non-empty &quot;accessible name&quot; without invoking repair techniques such as
reading filenames without img @src attributes?

<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/WAI.new/PF/aria/roles#namecalculation">http://www.w3.org/WAI.new/PF/aria/roles#namecalculation</A>

I realise the author requirements in the HTML spec seem to have
gradually become very forgiving here, not really sure why. :( I
realise that from a linting perspective this isn't 100% simple as you
need to check for alternate sources of accessible names like
@aria-labelledby and @title etc, and that the algorithm for doing this
isn't really properly defined &#8230; anywhere &#8230; Seemingly falling into the
cracks between the ARIA spec, Steve's mapping guide, and the WHATWG
HTML spec.

The cases where markup generators cannot provide a better control name
than _nothing_ seem to me much rarer than the cases where markup
generators cannot provide better text alternatives for photos etc -
maybe even non-existent - and when hand-authoring describing a control
is even easier than coming up with a text equivalent for a graphic.

It would help catch the not uncommon antipattern where the &quot;content&quot;
of a link or button is provided only by a background image.

   &lt;a href=&quot;somewhere&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;somewhere-else&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

   &lt;button class=&quot;delete&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;

   etc.

I'm especially keen on hearing about plausibility from Henri and Michael.
