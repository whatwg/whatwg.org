</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Though I still think that we should support reading out specific files

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compression and packaging. In that case they can easily either ensure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to stick with ASCII filenames, or encode the names in UTF8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what this was for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     // For convenience, add &quot;getter File? (DOMString name)&quot; to FileList, to
</I>&gt;<i> find a file by name.  This is equivalent
</I>&gt;<i>     // to iterating through files[] and comparing .name.  If no match is
</I>&gt;<i> found, return null.  This could be a function
</I>&gt;<i>     // instead of a getter.
</I>&gt;<i>     var example_file2 = zipFile.files[&quot;file.txt&quot;];
</I>&gt;<i>     if(example_file2 == null) { console.error(&quot;file.txt not found in ZIP&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> return; }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose a named getter isn't a great idea--you might have a filename
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;length&quot;--so a &quot;zipFile.files.find('file.txt')&quot; function is probably better.
</I>
I definitely wouldn't want to use a getter. That runs into all sorts
of problems and the syntactical wins are pretty small.

&gt;&gt;<i> One way we could support this would be to have a method which allows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting a list of meta-data about each entry. Probably together with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the File object itself. So we could return an array of objects like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [ {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     rawName: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     file: &lt;File object&gt;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     crc32: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   },
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     rawName: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     file: &lt;File object&gt;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     crc32: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   },
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That way we can also leave out the crc from archive types that doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means exposing two objects per file.  I'd prefer a single File-subclass
</I>&gt;<i> object per file, with any extra metadata put on the subclass.
</I>
First of all, we're be talking about 5 vs. 6 objects per file entry:
two ArrayBuffers, two ArrayBufferViews, one File and potentially one
JS-object. Actually, in Gecko it's more like 8 vs. 9 objects once you
start counting the C++ objects and their JS-wrappers.

Second, at least in the Gecko engine, allocating the first 5 objects
take about three orders of magnitude more time than allocating the
JS-object.

I'm also not a fan of sticking the crc32 on the File object itself
since we don't actually know that that's the correct crc32 value.

&gt;&gt;<i> But I like this approach a lot of we can make it work. The main thing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd be worried about, apart from the IO performance above, is if we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can make it work for a larger set of archive formats. Like, can we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make it work for .tar and .tar.gz? I think we couldn't but we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to verify.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It wouldn't handle it very well, but the original API wouldn't, either.  In
</I>&gt;<i> both cases, the only way to find filenames in a TAR--whether it's to search
</I>&gt;<i> for one or to construct a list--is to scan through the whole file (and
</I>&gt;<i> decompress it all, for .tgz).  Simply retrieving a list of filenames from a
</I>&gt;<i> large .tgz would thrash the user's disk and chew CPU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think there's much use in supporting .tar, anyway.  Even if you want
</I>&gt;<i> true streaming (which would be a different API anyway, since we're reading
</I>&gt;<i> from a Blob here), ZIP can do that too, by using the local file headers
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the central directory.
</I>
The main argument that I could see is that the initial proposal
allowed extracting files from a .tar.gz while only extracting up to
the point of finding the file-to-be-extracted. As long as
.getFileNames wasn't called. Which I'll grant isn't a huge benefit.
