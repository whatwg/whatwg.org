No, we can know it declaratively via the dropzone attribute.  That's
what these will key off of in HTML.  In @dropzone, you can declare the
types of data that it will accept, and you know the type of the data
as soon as the drag starts, so you have all the info you need.

We obviously can't address &quot;dropzones&quot; that are only detectable during
the dragover event.  That's fine - they just won't respond to these
pseudo-classes.  Consider it an inducement to use the new, better
model that @dropzone allows.


&gt;&gt;<i> As well, the pseudo that matches &quot;the drop target that will be used if

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, and that's not compatible with how drag and drop are implemented on

</I>
I know.  You'll notice that I didn't suggest we somehow change to
that.  ^_^  However, other languages might want this kind of model,
and we could in the future add a switch to allow this kind of behavior
in HTML. My point is just that, even if you solve the other problems,
you still might not be able to implement that pseudoclass in existing
CSS.
