To expand a little on rationale for what Jeffrey said:

We're working on an experimental preference setting for WebKit to block data storage in a third-party context, similar to the third-party cookie blocking feature in many browsers, but covering all forms of client-side storage. The intent of this is to make it more difficult for third-party content (such as ads or social media &quot;like&quot; buttons or similar) to track you across different sites, if you enable the feature.

In thinking about the design, we came to the conclusion that SharedWorkers are actually a form of client-side shared storage. In particular, you could set a global variable in a SharedWorker, and then vend it to subframes from the same domain on other pages. It seems that to match the intent of the feature, we have to do one of two things:

(1) Refuse access to SharedWorkers in a third-party context when the feature is enabled. This doesn't seem sanctioned by the spec, though other storage features have an explicit escape clause to refuse access based on privacy/security policy.

(2) Create a dedicated worker instead of connecting to or spawning a shared worker when a third party context attempts to access a SharedWorker and the feature is enabled. We think, but are not sure, that something like this is sanctioned by the spec.

We think (1) would be better and that's what we plan to do, unless other implementors feel strongly about taking the other approach. In either case, more clarity would be useful.

Regards,
Maciej

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While working on enhancing WebKit's privacy infrastructure, I noticed that shared workers don't have a UA security policy escape clause like localStorage and other APIs. The process to create a shared worker does not allow UAs to abort creation with a SecurityError if it decides that a document, origin, or script violates the UA's security policy.

</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
