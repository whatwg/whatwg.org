Very interesting idea...
Using globals is a way, bud a just a way, definitely not a good idea in 
general... (using globals in general, putting some information about 
gragged object into DataTransfer, some into some global variable)... 
That's bad even for one window app.
If you want example of cross window, I can give you one, I was working 
on administration, where certain information were presented using the 
same DOM constructions but they can be inserted/placed in different 
views so I've created the application as a set of iframes. But while 
using D&amp;D I've run into similar problem (I had a treeview of categories 
and certain data from another iframe can be copied/moved to certain 
nodes, not every data to every node), I had to solve it by putting data 
information in drag data item type... Being able to access some complex 
data in e.g. dragover event would be peachy
