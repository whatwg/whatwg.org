Could you give an example of how? I don't understand how it would work if 
we re-use an an existing MIME type. If you have any concrete examples I 
could look at that would be ideal.


&gt;<i> &gt; That seems like it is strictly more complicated (trivially so, but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still). What is the advantage?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I would say there are several advantages. First of all, JSON-LD is

</I>
More flexible and expressive than what?


&gt;<i> It has support for string internationalization, data typing, lists etc.
</I>
How would this manifest itself in this context? Are you suggesting that we 
should change the microdata to JSON serialisation rules somehow?

 
&gt;<i> It also allows to distinguish between IRIs and literals (which isn't the 
</I>&gt;<i> case for application/microdata+json) which is important for Linked Data 
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>
Could you give an example of how this would help an application?

It would help if you described what precise changes you would like to see 
to the algorithms, so that I better understood the implications here.


&gt;<i> Secondly, there is an API for JSON-LD to reframe [1] a document into a 
</I>&gt;<i> shape that might be easier to work with in a web app (I think that's the 
</I>&gt;<i> whole point of microdata+json or am I wrong?).
</I>
I don't understand what this means.


&gt;<i> Other API calls allow e.g. to convert to and from RDF [2]. If you are 
</I>&gt;<i> interested, there is an online JSON-LD playground [3] where you can play 
</I>&gt;<i> with the various API calls. Last but not least it would also make web 
</I>&gt;<i> developers life easier if there are fewer formats to support/learn.
</I>
Currently, the data is just stored as JSON, it's not a new format. It's 
only a new MIME type to allow easier filtering in the drag-and-drop API.
