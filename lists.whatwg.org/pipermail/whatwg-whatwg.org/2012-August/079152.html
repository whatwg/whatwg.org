<PRE>Le 10/08/2012 20:06, Erik Reppen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Sorry if this double-posted but I think I forgot to CC the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Browser vendor politics I can understand but if we're going to talk about
</I>&gt;<i> what &quot;history shows&quot; about people like myself suggesting features we can't
</I>&gt;<i> actually support I'd like to see some studies that contradict the
</I>&gt;<i> experiences I've had as a web ui developer for the last five years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everybody seems on board with providing a JavaScript strict mode. How is
</I>&gt;<i> this any different?
</I>JavaScript strict mode enables to make a JavaScript program secure 
(there is some additional work to do, but you can do it yourself as a 
programmer) while it's almost impossible to write a secure program in 
non-strict JavaScript because of scope-violating (indirect) eval. 
JavaScript strict mode is almost a different language with that regard.
The ability to write securable JavaScript required an intervention at 
the language level.

HTML has no such thing to win with a strict mode as far as I know.
Also, JS strict mode deals with runtime and not syntax (with statement 
aside). That's far different from what could be expected from an HTML 
strict mode.

To some extent, CSP (&quot;Content Security Policy&quot;, about to reach 
Recommandation stage soon) is your &quot;HTML strict mode&quot; if you care about 
security.
