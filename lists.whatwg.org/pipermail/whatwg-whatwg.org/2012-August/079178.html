</I>&gt;<i> &quot;UTF-16LE&quot; and &quot;UTF-16BE&quot; mean &quot;always use this exact encoding&quot;.
</I>

Let me take a crack at making this into an algorithm:

In the TextDecoder constructor:

   - If encoding is not specified, set an internal useBOM flag
   - If encoding is specified and is a case insensitive match for &quot;utf-16&quot;
   set an internal useBOM flag.

NOTE: This means if &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;utf-16le&quot; or &quot;utf-16be&quot; is explicitly
specified the flag is not set.

When decode() is called

   - If useBOM is set and the stream offset is 0, then
      - If there are not enough bytes to test for a BOM then return without
      emitting anything (NOTE: if not streaming an EOF byte would be present in
      the stream which would be a negative match for a BOM)
      - If encoding is &quot;utf-16&quot; and the first bytes match 0xFF 0xFE or 0xFE
      0xFF then set current encoding to &quot;utf-16&quot; or &quot;utf-16be&quot; respectively and
      advance the stream past the BOM. The current encoding is used until the
      stream is reset.
      - Otherwise, if the first bytes match 0xFF 0xFE, 0xFE 0xFF, or 0xEF
      0xBB 0xBF then set current encoding to &quot;utf-16&quot;, &quot;utf-16be&quot; or &quot;utf-8&quot;
      respectively and advance the stream past the BOM. The current encoding is
      used until the stream is reset.
   - Otherwise, if useBOM is not set and the steam offset is 0, then if the
   encoding is &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;utf-16&quot; or &quot;utf-16be&quot;
      - If the first bytes match 0xFF 0xFE, 0xFE 0xFF, or 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF
      then let detected encoding be &quot;utf-16&quot;, &quot;utf-16be&quot; or &quot;utf-8&quot;
respectively.
      If the detected encoding matches the object's encoding, advance
the stream
      past the BOM. Otherwise, if the fatal flag is set then throw a
      &quot;EncodingError&quot; DOMException. Otherwise, the decoding algorithm proceeds.
      - If there are not enough bytes to test for a BOM then return without
      emitting anything (NOTE: if not streaming an EOF byte would be inserted
      which would be a negative match for a BOM)

Working the &quot;current encoding&quot; switcheroo into the spec will require some
refactoring, so trying to get consensus here first.

In English:

   - Create an encoder with TextDecoder() and if present a BOM will be
   respected (and consumed) otherwise default to UTF-8
   - Create an encoder with TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16&quot;) and either UTF-16LE or
   UTF-16BE BOM will be respected (and consumed) otherwise default to UTF-16LE
   (which may decode garbage if UTF-8 BOM or other non-UTF-16 data is present)
   - Create an encoder with TextDecoder(&quot;utf-8&quot;,
   {fatal:true}), TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16le&quot;, {fatal:true}),
   TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16be&quot;, {fatal:true}) and a matching BOM will be consumed,
   a mismatching BOM will throw an EncodingError
   - Create an encoder with TextDecoder(&quot;utf-8&quot;), TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16le&quot;),
   TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16be&quot;) and a matching BOM will be consumed, a mismatching
   BOM will be blithely decoded (probably giving you replacement characters),
   but not throwing.

 * If one of the UTF encodings is specified AND the BOM matches then the
&gt;<i> &gt; leading BOM character (U+FEFF) MUST NOT be emitted in the output
</I>&gt;<i> character
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sequence (i.e. it is silently consumed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a little weird that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> data = readFile(&quot;user-supplied-file.txt&quot;); // shortcutting for brevity
</I>&gt;<i> var s = new TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16&quot;).decode(data); // or utf-8
</I>&gt;<i> s = s.replace(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> var data2 = new TextEncoder(&quot;utf-16&quot;).encode(s);
</I>&gt;<i> writeFile(&quot;user-supplied-file.txt&quot;, data2);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> causes the BOM to be quietly stripped away.  Normally if you're modifying a
</I>&gt;<i> file, you want to pass through the BOM (or lack thereof) untouched.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way to deal with this could be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> var decoder = new TextDecoder(&quot;utf-16&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> var s = decoder.decode(data);
</I>&gt;<i> s = s.replace(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> var data2 = new TextEncoder(decoder.encoding).encode(s);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where decoder.encoding is eg. &quot;UTF-16LE-BOM&quot; if a BOM was present, thus
</I>&gt;<i> preserving both the BOM and (for UTF-16) endianness.  I don't actually like
</I>&gt;<i> this, though, because I don't like the idea of decoder.encoding changing
</I>&gt;<i> after the decoder has already been constructed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I agree with just stripping it, and people who want to preserve
</I>&gt;<i> BOMs on write-through can jump the hoops manually (which aren't terribly
</I>&gt;<i> hard).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This gets easier if we restrict to encoding UTF-8 which typically doesn't
include BOMs. But it's looking like there's enough desire to keep UTF-16
encoding at the moment. Agree with just stripping it for now.


&gt;<i> Another issue is &quot;new TextDecoder('ascii').encoding&quot; (and ISO-8859-1)
</I>&gt;<i> giving .encoding = &quot;windows-1252&quot;.  That's strange, even when you know why
</I>&gt;<i> it's happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any reason to expose the actual &quot;primary&quot; names?  It's not clear
</I>&gt;<i> that the &quot;name&quot; column in the Encoding spec is even intended to be exposed
</I>&gt;<i> to APIs; they look more like labels for specs to refer to internally.
</I>&gt;<i> (Anne?)  If there's no pressing reason to expose this, I'd suggest that the
</I>&gt;<i> .encoding attribute simply return the name that was passed to the
</I>&gt;<i> constructor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's still not ideal (it's weird that asking for ASCII gives you something
</I>&gt;<i> other than ASCII in the first place), but it at least seems a bit less
</I>&gt;<i> strange.  The &quot;nice&quot; fix would be to implement actual ASCII, ISO-8859-1,
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-8859-9, etc. charsets, but that just means extra implementation work
</I>&gt;<i> (and some charset proliferation) without use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Leaning towards simply dropping the attribute. Does anyone advocate for
keeping it?
