</I>
We're talking about when a document gets aborted here. Interop really 
isn't particularly critical. I think this is an area where it makes a lot 
more sense to keep things simple.

The platform is confusing enough as it is without us having confusing 
behaviour where it's not strictly necessary.


&gt;<i> I think that in a situation like this change is more harmful and likely 
</I>&gt;<i> to break something than the sort of logic you offered is useful.
</I>
Can you elaborate on how any changes here are really likely to break 
anything? I'm finding it hard to see why this area is interop-sensitive.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 10) XSLT error pages don't count as aborts but instead as non-aborted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; loads of the error page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      Rationale:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;        * Makes parent pages less confused about events they are waiting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;        * Already true except for bugs in Firefox which is the only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; browser with XSLT error pages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     Delta from the spec: Make explicit in spec.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't defined this because to define this I'd have to define a ton of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infrastructure that explains how XSLT works in the first place, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still waiting for the XSLT community to write the tests that demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what the requirements should be:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think you need to spec infrastructure to define a high-level
</I>&gt;<i> expectation that loads with XSLT errors are supposed to finish as if
</I>&gt;<i> they were successful loads rather than aborted loads.
</I>
IMHO there's no value in making vague meaningless statements (which the 
statement &quot;loads with XSLT errors are supposed to finish as if they were 
successful loads&quot; would be without defining &quot;loads&quot; for XSLT, &quot;finish&quot; for 
such loads, and &quot;as if&quot;).
