<PRE>Hi Ian,

I think the changes to the spec in regards to advice for use of title
are a practical step in the right direction.

&gt;&gt;<i> The spec currently allows img without alt if the title attribute is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> present
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a wild over-statement of the case.
</I>
In terms of conformance checking it is not, as you have said yourself,
and others have echoed, most developers will not read the spec and
therefore will not understand or take account of the nuances of when
alt is required.

The conformance checker on the other hand as per HTML LS will not flag
this as an error

&lt;img title=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

which is a clear signal that it is allowed.

While putting requirements into the spec on what browser implementers
must do to conform with it is one thing, whether and when they do is
what I am interested in, and for the past 19 years they have not
provided input device independent access to the title attribute, lets
hope that changes and until it does so conformance should reflect this
fact.

&gt;&gt;<i> It is suggested that due to the current and historical implementation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> title attribute display in browser, discouraging authors from using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img title=&quot;text&quot;&gt; markup pattern would result in more usable and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accessible content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is suggested by whom? I'm not sure I follow.
</I>
I suggest. Providing content as text as against it being hidden in an
attribute that requires a mouse to access it, will  make the content
more usable and accessible.

While it is unfortunate that we still have a conformance requirement
difference between HTML LS and HTML5 I am satisfied at least that the
major conformance checking tool on the web will reflect the HTML5
conformance rule disallowing &lt;img title=&quot;text&quot;&gt;, and as we are often
told, shipping code wins.

regards

</I>&gt;<i> That's a wild over-statement of the case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be precise, the specification requires that the alt attribute be
</I>&gt;<i> present, with the exception of some very specific cases. The specific case
</I>&gt;<i> where the presence of the title=&quot;&quot; attribute is in any way relevant is the
</I>&gt;<i> specific case where the image is obtained in some automated fashion
</I>&gt;<i> without any associated alternative text (e.g. a Webcam), or because the
</I>&gt;<i> page is being generated by a script using user-provided images where the
</I>&gt;<i> user did not provide suitable or usable alternative text (e.g. photograph
</I>&gt;<i> sharing sites), or because the author does not himself know what the
</I>&gt;<i> images represent (e.g. a blind photographer sharing an image on his blog).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only in those cases can the alt=&quot;&quot; attribute be omitted if the title=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute is instead present with text. In all other cases, &lt;img&gt; elements
</I>&gt;<i> in Web pages must have alt=&quot;&quot; attributes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is problematic for a number of reasons:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. One of the functions of alt as implemented is that the text is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displayed when images are disabled or not available. I ran some tests a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while back[1] and found that while webkit based browsers display title
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute content if images are disabled or not available, IE, Firefox
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Opera do not. I did a quick recheck and focund the implementations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have not changed in the 2.5 years since I ran those tests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. title attribute content is commonly displayed as a tooltip that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears when a user moves their mouse over an element (in this case an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> img) It is long running issue (14 years or so) that tooltips and thus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> title attribute content is not displayed for keyboard only users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Browsers vendors are fully aware of the issue, but as yet there have not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet been moves to fix the issue*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are violations of the UAAG, and affect far more than images. Any
</I>&gt;<i> situation where there is content in a title=&quot;&quot; attribute would be an
</I>&gt;<i> accessibility problem, if title=&quot;&quot; attributes aren't exposed. Either we
</I>&gt;<i> should therefore drop the title=&quot;&quot; attribute (unlikely to be a practical
</I>&gt;<i> option), or we should fix the browsers to expose title=&quot;&quot; attributes in
</I>&gt;<i> cases where the user is not able to trigger the tooltip.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've updated the spec to be clearer about this.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accessible content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is suggested by whom? I'm not sure I follow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We could address this problem by making changes along these lines:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Remove the clause in the spec that makes the markup pattern conforming:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The title attribute is present and has a non-empty value&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't solve the problem in the general case, so it's not really a
</I>&gt;<i> solution worth considering. It just papers over a minor case (where the
</I>&gt;<i> page is in all likelihood not accessible anyway, since the author doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> know what the image is) while ignoring the much larger issue of title=&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> not being exposed.

</I>&gt;<i>  - people &quot;often&quot; use the attribute in inappropriate ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - all new WYSIWYG editors, when faced with an unknown image, give bogus
</I>&gt;<i>    alt texts rather than no alt text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If people don't abuse the attribute and some editors give no alt text
</I>&gt;<i> rather than bogus alt text, then it's a success, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, we'd have some way of comparing the situation now with the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctly? Are validator users more or less happy? Most importantly, are
