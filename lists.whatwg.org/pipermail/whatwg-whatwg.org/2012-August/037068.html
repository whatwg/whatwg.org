</I>
That's &lt;body&gt;, as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> Remember how we sectioned our documents in those old days? It's the 
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless &lt;div&gt;s. We used them and added id=&quot;header&quot;, id=&quot;content&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> id=&quot;sidebar&quot;, and id=&quot;footer&quot; to them.
</I>
Having now got &lt;header&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, the content that is left, 
more or less by process of elimination, is the content.


&gt;<i> However, today, we are still using the meaningless &lt;div&gt; for our 
</I>&gt;<i> content.
</I>
Why?

&gt;<i> This example mentioned above is a typical situation that we need an 
</I>&gt;<i> element for the main content. So instead of keep wrapping our contents 
</I>&gt;<i> with the meaningless &lt;div&gt;, why not let the &quot;content&quot; element join 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5?
</I>
What would the element _mean_? If it's just &quot;the main content&quot;, then that 
is what the element's contents would mean even without the element, so 
really it means the element is meaningless. And in that case, &lt;div&gt; is 
perfect, since that's what it is: a grouping element with no meaning.

</I>
Indeed, dependong on what exactly you mean by &quot;content&quot; these might be 
more appropriate.

</I>&gt;<i> Both section and article elements are not the candidate for containing a

</I>
The element that contains &quot;a website or a blog entry's main content&quot; is 
&lt;body&gt;, as far as I can tell.

Well, the &quot;content&quot; is what is left after you take out the stuff that 
isn't the &quot;content&quot; (&lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, etc).


&gt;<i> The read question for me is: What is the problem of having the content 
</I>&gt;<i> at the same level of &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; (for example inside an 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt;)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can't we treat everything inside an article which is not in &lt;header&gt; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;footer&gt; is the real &quot;content&quot;?
</I>
That's the intent of the spec, right.

I don't understand what the problem is here. How is it &quot;messy&quot;?

If you just want to group some elements together without giving them any 
special meaning, that's what &lt;div&gt; is for.

This role is unnecessary in HTML documents, since browsers can skip the 
non-main content. That's the whole point of elements like &lt;nav&gt;.


&gt;<i> I agree that an explicit element would be nice, but the powers that be

</I>
It's not clear what the idea is, so it's hard to say that it has been 
rejected. :-)

Could you elaborate on what this element would do and/or mean?
