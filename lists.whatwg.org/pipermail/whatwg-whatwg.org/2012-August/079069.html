<PRE>Ian Hickson &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ian at hixie.ch</A>&gt;, 2012-08-01 07:56 +0000:
&gt;<i> We briefly brainstormed some ideas on #whatwg earlier tonight, and one 
</I>&gt;<i> name in particular that I think could work is the absurdly long
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has several key characteristics that I think are good:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - it's long, so people aren't going to want to type it out
</I>&gt;<i>  - it's long, so it will stick out in copy-and-paste scenarios
</I>&gt;<i>  - it's emminently searchable (long unique term) and so will likely lead 
</I>&gt;<i>    to good documentation if it's adopted
</I>&gt;<i>  - the &quot;generator&quot; part implies that it's for use by generators, and may 
</I>&gt;<i>    discourage authors from using it
</I>&gt;<i>  - the &quot;unable&quot; and &quot;required&quot; parts make it obvious that using this 
</I>&gt;<i>    attribute is an act of last resort
</I>
Speaking as a validator contributor-implementor, I support the addition of
this attribute, with the &quot;generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt&quot; name or
at the very least with the characteristics of the name Hixie outlines here.

Moreover, I intend to implement experimental support for it in the
validator.nu engine relatively soon. Henri has also stated that he thinks a
related proposal from Ted O'Connor for a similar attribute but with a
different name (&quot;relaxed&quot;) &quot;would be eligible for implementation in
Validator.nu if the proposal were adopted by the HTML WG&quot;.

  <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html</A>

I suspect that Ted would be amenable to updating that proposal to use the
&quot;generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt&quot; instead of &quot;relaxed&quot;, so I think
we have convergence on agreement for adding this attribute.

&gt;<i> This attribute would be non-conforming except when provided in markup 
</I>&gt;<i> generated by user agents that find themselves with an image and no 
</I>&gt;<i> suitable alt=&quot;&quot; text. It would be a third option in the &quot;Images whose 
</I>&gt;<i> contents are not known&quot; section of the spec. It would be mentioned in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Guidance for markup generators&quot; section, along with some text about using 
</I>&gt;<i> one of the other two alternatives when the image in question is the center 
</I>&gt;<i> of attention on the page (as in the Flickr case), rather than using this 
</I>&gt;<i> new attribute. It would replace the &quot;generator&quot; exception in the &quot;Guidance 
</I>&gt;<i> for conformance checkers&quot; section. The note in the &quot;generator&quot; section 
</I>&gt;<i> would be removed.
</I>
I support all those changes. I can't speak for Henri on all those points,
but note that Henri has also recently indicated he's agreeable to dropping
the &quot;generator&quot; section -

  <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2012Aug/0020.html</A>
  &quot;I agree that &lt;meta name=generator&gt; is a bad solution both because it
  tries to repurpose existing syntax in a way that's not expected by the
  current generators of the syntax and because of its lack of
  granularity.&quot;

&gt;<i> If we do this, I think we should commit to revisiting the issue in a year 
</I>&gt;<i> or two, to examine what impact this is having on Web pages: is the 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute used in inappropriate ways? Is it used badly more than 
</I>&gt;<i> correctly? Are validator users more or less happy? Most importantly, are 
</I>&gt;<i> alt=&quot;&quot; texts overall better or worse? Have any generators started using 
</I>&gt;<i> the attribute rather than outputting bogus alt=&quot;&quot; values?
</I>
Agreed. I support making having some kind of &quot;trial period&quot; like what you
describe, or a year or two or 18 months. If we do that I would prefer that
the spec include some kind of note/warning making it clear that the
attribute is experimental and may be dropped or changed significantly
within the next two years based on analysis we get back during that time.
