</I>&gt;<i> When running a native application on most contemporary operating

</I>&gt;<i> trust it to not read private data from your computer and send it to a

</I>&gt;<i> emails. You trust it to not install backdoors and hand control over
</I>&gt;<i> your computer to other people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't generally true with web applications. People often end up
</I>&gt;<i> running web applications that they don't trust in the least. They just
</I>&gt;<i> clicked a link in an email or on a search result page. They still
</I>&gt;<i> expect none of the above things to happen, but not because the pages
</I>&gt;<i> that they end up on won't attempt to do it, but because the browser
</I>&gt;<i> will prevent any of the above from happening.
</I>

You're absolutely right, I was merely responding to the claim that every
web app would try to get its workers to have a high priority.

Yes, this is indeed a problem, because that trust is the foundation of the
web platform. We should never allow a developer to abuse the system
resources, intentionally nor unintentionally. Regardless, AFAICT Web Audio
API already breaks that promise as the native nodes can easily eat all the
CPU in a real time thread. However, I made a suggestion on how to mend this
and I think it could be applied to the real time audio workers as well. [1]
Thoughts?

Cheers,
Jussi
