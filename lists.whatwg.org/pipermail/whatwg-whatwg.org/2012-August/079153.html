</I>&gt;<i> done right in the first place and visible breakage or at least browser

There's nothing stopping you from writing XHTML5. This is what I do
for exactly the reasons you describe. If you write polyglot documents,
you can use application/xhtml+xml in development, serve text/html in
production and still sleep at night. Hell, these days you can even
serve application/xhtml+xml in production if IE &lt; 9 isn't a
significant market segment for you.
