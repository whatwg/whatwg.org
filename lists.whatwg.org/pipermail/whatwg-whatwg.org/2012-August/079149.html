As I said, years of evidence have provided strong evidence that a
large majority of authors cannot guarantee that their pages are valid
all of the time.  This covers both authoring-time validity and
validity after including user comments or the like.

If you want a mode that guarantees validity, that already exists -
it's called &quot;put a validator into your workflow&quot;.  Many popular text
editors offer plugins that validate your markup as you go, as well.

The problem with breaking visibly is that it doesn't punish authors,
it punishes *users*, who overwhelmingly blame the browser rather than
the site author when the site won't display for whatever reason.
There's no *benefit* to a browser for doing this; it's much more in
their interest to continue doing error-recovery, because, again,
history suggests very strongly that most authors *who theoretically
want strict parsing* can't actually satisfy the constrains they ask
for.  It's simply better for users to always do soft error-recovery,
no matter what the author claims they want.
