I haven't added this, but I agree that it's an issue. Really what is 
needed is more a &quot;keyboard capture&quot; mode where normal keyboard shortcuts 
get disabled so that the application can handle them. However, it's not 
clear exactly which you would want. Sometimes you might e.g. want 
left/up/right/down to no longer scroll the page, but other times you might 
still want it to scroll an overflowing div. You might want the space bar 
to not scroll down but instead to fire a weapon in a game, but if the app 
scrolls (e.g. as GMail does) maybe you still want it to page down.

I don't know what a good solution is. The current solution is to just 
catch the keystrokes you care about and cancel them... that might just be 
the way to go for now.
