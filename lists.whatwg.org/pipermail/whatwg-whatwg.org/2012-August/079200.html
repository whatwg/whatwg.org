</I>
That's what this was for:

    // For convenience, add &quot;getter File? (DOMString name)&quot; to FileList, to
find a file by name.  This is equivalent
    // to iterating through files[] and comparing .name.  If no match is
found, return null.  This could be a function
    // instead of a getter.
    var example_file2 = zipFile.files[&quot;file.txt&quot;];
    if(example_file2 == null) { console.error(&quot;file.txt not found in ZIP&quot;;
return; }

I suppose a named getter isn't a great idea--you might have a filename
&quot;length&quot;--so a &quot;zipFile.files.find('file.txt')&quot; function is probably better.

By allowing them to download a .zip file, they can also store that
&gt;<i> .zip in compressed form in IndexedDB or the FileSystem API in order to
</I>&gt;<i> use less space on the user's device. (Additionally many times IO gets
</I>&gt;<i> faster by using .zip files because the time saved in doing less IO is
</I>&gt;<i> larger than the time spent decompressing. Obviously very dependent on
</I>&gt;<i> what data is being stored).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's also the question of when decompression happens--you don't want to
decompress the whole thing in advance if you can avoid it, since if the
user isn't doing random access you can stream the decompression--but that's
just QoI, of course.

One way we could support this would be to have a method which allows
&gt;<i> getting a list of meta-data about each entry. Probably together with
</I>&gt;<i> the File object itself. So we could return an array of objects like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [ {
</I>&gt;<i>     rawName: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>     file: &lt;File object&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>     crc32: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   },
</I>&gt;<i>   {
</I>&gt;<i>     rawName: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>     file: &lt;File object&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>     crc32: &lt;UInt8Array&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   },
</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i> ]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That way we can also leave out the crc from archive types that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> support it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This means exposing two objects per file.  I'd prefer a single
File-subclass object per file, with any extra metadata put on the subclass.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is definitely an interesting idea. The current API is designed
</I>&gt;<i> around doing the IO when each individual operation is done. You are
</I>&gt;<i> proposing to do all IO up front which allows all operations to be
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that doing the IO &quot;lazily&quot; can provide better performance
</I>&gt;<i> for some types of operations, such as only wanting to extract a single
</I>&gt;<i> resource from an archive. But maybe the difference wouldn't be that
</I>&gt;<i> big in most cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd expect the I/O savings to be negligible, since ZIP has a central
directory at the end, allowing the whole thing to be read very quickly.

I hope creating an array of File objects (even thousands of them) isn't too
expensive.  Even if it is, though, this could be refactored to still give a
synchronous interface: store the file directory natively (in a non-File,
non-GC'd way), and allow looking up and iterating that list in a way that
only instantiates one File object at a time.  (This would lose the FileList
API compatibility with &lt;input type=file&gt;, though, which I think is a nice
plus.)

But I like this approach a lot of we can make it work. The main thing
&gt;<i> I'd be worried about, apart from the IO performance above, is if we
</I>&gt;<i> can make it work for a larger set of archive formats. Like, can we
</I>&gt;<i> make it work for .tar and .tar.gz? I think we couldn't but we would
</I>&gt;<i> need to verify.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It wouldn't handle it very well, but the original API wouldn't, either.  In
both cases, the only way to find filenames in a TAR--whether it's to search
for one or to construct a list--is to scan through the whole file (and
decompress it all, for .tgz).  Simply retrieving a list of filenames from a
large .tgz would thrash the user's disk and chew CPU.

I don't think there's much use in supporting .tar, anyway.  Even if you
want true streaming (which would be a different API anyway, since we're
reading from a Blob here), ZIP can do that too, by using the local file
headers instead of the central directory.
