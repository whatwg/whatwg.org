I wasn't debating whether or not shipping a device with a 1.5 pixel
ratio is the best decision, but answering: &quot;Is there a good reason
to believe that will be something other than a power of two?&quot;

The fact that it has happened seems a pretty good reason to believe
that it may happen.

&gt;<i> Fractional ratios have proven to be unnecessary: on desktops 1x CSS  
</I>&gt;<i> pixel changed from 72dpi (CRT) to 130dpi on notebook screens, but we  
</I>&gt;<i> haven't got fractional scaling ratios along the way. Variability in  
</I>&gt;<i> screen sizes and actual DPI has been accepted. The same can happen with  
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5x-2.5x screens: pretend they all are 2x, vary CSS pixel width/height,  
</I>&gt;<i> accept physical size of CSS pixel will be slightly different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example the 2.25 ratio doesn't make sense to me. 12.5% increase in  
</I>&gt;<i> screen density is going to be imperceptible. A better solution would be  
</I>&gt;<i> to use the crisp 2x ratio and have bigger screen area (in CSS pixels).
</I>
A ratio of 2.25 on 720 physical pixel device gives a viewport width of 320
css pixels. 320 pixels is the same as the iPhone, and being identical to
that helps with site compatibility.

I am not convinced that using 2.25 was the best decision, but it has
some justifications, and has happened, so I don't think it is reasonable
to bake in some assumptions in the spec (only powers of 2) when we
know that they don't match reality.
