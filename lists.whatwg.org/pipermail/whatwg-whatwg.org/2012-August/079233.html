</I>&gt;<i> The spec currently allows img without alt if the title attribute is 
</I>&gt;<i> present
</I>
That's a wild over-statement of the case.

To be precise, the specification requires that the alt attribute be 
present, with the exception of some very specific cases. The specific case 
where the presence of the title=&quot;&quot; attribute is in any way relevant is the 
specific case where the image is obtained in some automated fashion 
without any associated alternative text (e.g. a Webcam), or because the 
page is being generated by a script using user-provided images where the 
user did not provide suitable or usable alternative text (e.g. photograph 
sharing sites), or because the author does not himself know what the 
images represent (e.g. a blind photographer sharing an image on his blog).

Only in those cases can the alt=&quot;&quot; attribute be omitted if the title=&quot;&quot; 
attribute is instead present with text. In all other cases, &lt;img&gt; elements 
in Web pages must have alt=&quot;&quot; attributes.


&gt;<i> This is problematic for a number of reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. One of the functions of alt as implemented is that the text is 
</I>&gt;<i> displayed when images are disabled or not available. I ran some tests a 
</I>&gt;<i> while back[1] and found that while webkit based browsers display title 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute content if images are disabled or not available, IE, Firefox 
</I>&gt;<i> and Opera do not. I did a quick recheck and focund the implementations 
</I>&gt;<i> have not changed in the 2.5 years since I ran those tests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. title attribute content is commonly displayed as a tooltip that 
</I>&gt;<i> appears when a user moves their mouse over an element (in this case an 
</I>&gt;<i> img) It is long running issue (14 years or so) that tooltips and thus 
</I>&gt;<i> title attribute content is not displayed for keyboard only users. 
</I>&gt;<i> Browsers vendors are fully aware of the issue, but as yet there have not 
</I>&gt;<i> yet been moves to fix the issue*
</I>
These are violations of the UAAG, and affect far more than images. Any 
situation where there is content in a title=&quot;&quot; attribute would be an 
accessibility problem, if title=&quot;&quot; attributes aren't exposed. Either we 
should therefore drop the title=&quot;&quot; attribute (unlikely to be a practical 
option), or we should fix the browsers to expose title=&quot;&quot; attributes in 
cases where the user is not able to trigger the tooltip.

I've updated the spec to be clearer about this.


&gt;<i> It is suggested that due to the current and historical implementation of 
</I>&gt;<i> title attribute display in browser, discouraging authors from using the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img title=&quot;text&quot;&gt; markup pattern would result in more usable and 
</I>&gt;<i> accessible content.
</I>
It is suggested by whom? I'm not sure I follow.


&gt;<i> We could address this problem by making changes along these lines:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remove the clause in the spec that makes the markup pattern conforming:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The title attribute is present and has a non-empty value&quot;
</I>
This doesn't solve the problem in the general case, so it's not really a 
solution worth considering. It just papers over a minor case (where the 
page is in all likelihood not accessible anyway, since the author doesn't 
know what the image is) while ignoring the much larger issue of title=&quot;&quot; 
not being exposed.

The spec encourages authors to use either title=&quot;&quot; or &lt;figcaption&gt; in this 
situation. I've updated the spec to warn authors that contemporary user 
agents fail to expose the title=&quot;&quot; attribute.

When there's no alt attribute, if the image can't be rendered, the user 
agent should display some sort of indicator that there is an image that is 
not being rendered, and may, if requested by the user, or if so 
configured, or when required to provide contextual information in response 
to navigation, provide caption information for the image based on the 
title=&quot;&quot; attribute or (if there's no title=&quot;&quot;) &lt;figcaption&gt;.

Note that the spec doesn't currently say to do this; it says what I said 
above, namely that if there's no alt=&quot;&quot;, the presence of the image should 
be indicated, and the caption information provided as caption information.

I would applaud doing what the spec says, as I described above. :-)

The spec is pretty clear here, IMHO. (I've tried to make it even clearer.)

I've added a warning in that section and changed it from SHOULD to COULD 
for now. Since this is an accessibility problem, I remain hopeful that 
browser vendors will eventually fix their handling of title=&quot;&quot;.

I've also added a note about using CSS if title=&quot;&quot; is used.

I've now added this to the spec.

Humans are incredibly adept at deducing context, and are quite able to 
reuse to comply to unethical requests. Such a human could, ofr instance, 
look at the image to determine what its meaning was, or could refuse to 
add the image without clear information on what the image was. Even if the 
human in this case was a mindless automaton, that is no reason to make the 
document conforming: the person asking the mindless automaton to add the 
image knows what the meaning of the image is, so there's no reason for the 
page to lack alternative text.


&gt;<i> So what about the poor human then?

The only &quot;poor human&quot; in this dicussion is the AT user who can't work out 
what the page is saying.

Actually, the argument here is very much that it does. Specifically, the 
argument is that WYSIWYG editor implementors will be pressured into making 
their tools output conforming content by people who don't understand the 
subtlties of this thread, based purely on validator output. Thus if we 
make the validator not complain when this error happens, they won't be 
pressured to do this.


&gt;<i> This is an example of the &quot;validation as quality assurance&quot; fallacy that

That only works when these implementors can in any way be expected to 
generate alternative texts. The point is they sometimes can't.


&gt;<i> And they *can* do a lot about it. They can initiate a user dialog,

A user converting 100,000 PDFs to HTML isn't going to be entering 
alternative texts for each image.

Not really...

</I>&gt;<i> poor human employee to write just something into the alt attribute? 
</I>&gt;<i> (Making him type nonsense, mostly, of course.)

Because it's nowhere near as infeasible in this case.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Even alt=&quot;unknown image&quot; or alt=&quot;unknown image named foobar.jpg&quot; is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; better than lack of alt attribute (or alt=&quot;&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the contrary; alt=&quot;unknown image&quot; is equivalent to &lt;span&gt;unknown

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; says &quot;unknown image&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's a bit too theoretical, isn't it? On similar grounds, you might

I'm not sure where the &quot;and nothing else&quot; comes from.

I think there's also the possibility that people will be happy, blissfully

&gt;<i> If an experiment on this topic was to be run, what would you measure how 
</I>&gt;<i> would you interpret the measurements?
</I>
I would consider the experiment a success unless the following was found:

 - people &quot;often&quot; use the attribute in inappropriate ways.

 - all new WYSIWYG editors, when faced with an unknown image, give bogus 
   alt texts rather than no alt text.

If people don't abuse the attribute and some editors give no alt text 
rather than bogus alt text, then it's a success, IMHO.

Ideally, we'd have some way of comparing the situation now with the 
situation in the future, e.g. by coming up with a way to look at editors 
and determining whether they've overall moved to giving more or less bogus 
alt text.

(I described this the original e-mail:

&gt;<i> If we do this, I think we should commit to revisiting the issue in a 
</I>&gt;<i> year or two, to examine what impact this is having on Web pages: is the 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute used in inappropriate ways? Is it used badly more than

</I>&gt;<i> alt=&quot;&quot; texts overall better or worse? Have any generators started using 
</I>&gt;<i> the attribute rather than outputting bogus alt=&quot;&quot; values?

That's more or less what I'd recommend. :-)

At the end of the day, pretty much everything we spec is an experiment. 
It's just that this one is something where we're even less confident than

Isn't that a good thing? How often are you expecting people to type the 
attribute? I would expect each editor implementor to type it once. They

I think clarity of the attribute's purpose is really important here, 
because the attribute does nothing at all other than exist. Its only 
purpose is to convey information, it doesn't actually _do_ anything. So 
IMHO having it be precise is critical.

For most attributes, I would say the name is an opaque detail, and we 
could just go with pretty much any name without really harming the feature 
that much. But here, the name _is_ the feature.

I think this misses the point -- it's not _ugly_, just verbose.

I'm not sure I understand the suggestion here. Can you elaborate?

This is should-level non-conforming and has no reason to be conforming, as 
far as I can tell (&quot;elements whose content model allows any flow content 
or phrasing content SHOULD have at least one child node that is palpable 
content and that does not have the hidden attribute specified&quot;).

The only reason it's not entirely non-conforming (&quot;must&quot; rather than 
&quot;should&quot;) is that there are some edge cases where it makes sense, e.g. 
when you have an empty paragraph that you're going to fill in later.

But maybe we should tighten this up again, e.g. for interactive content?

That's not really the reason behind allowing incomplete pages. Incomplete 
pages can be saved without having to be conforming.

The spec only concerns itself with the latter.
