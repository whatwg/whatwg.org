unrelated.

That's a fair point, actually.  It would be possible to use noreferrer from
script code (if somewhat inelegant).

It's also worth noting that this proposal's cleaner syntax for window.open
has no way to block the referrer if that's what the developers wanted.
 That means they'd have to choose between cleaner window.open syntax that
passes the referrer or the workaround approach that blocks it.

To be honest, I haven't heard strong enough support for the allow-referrer
case to justify this proposal on the basis of &quot;cleaner syntax&quot; alone.
 Maybe we should table the discussion unless a stronger use case arises?

(I'm aware that this doesn't resolve the question of whether named windows
should be discoverable outside their unit of related browsing contexts.
 Perhaps that can be discussed further separately.)

Sound reasonable?
Charlie

ps-- I'll be away from email from tomorrow until September 12, but can
follow up with any further discussion after that.
