Le 10 ao&#251;t 2012 &#224; 20:19, Tab Atkins Jr. a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I don't wish to spend the time to dig up the studies showing that 95% or so of XML served as text/html is invalid XML
</I>
That doesn't really makes sense, but I guess what Tab meant is

People attempting to write documents 
* with XML syntax rules (such as for example XHTML 1.0), 
* and serving it as text/html.

Often, these documents are NOT well-formed, even before being valid, and even-less conformant. 

On top of that you can add a layer of madness with user-agent sniffing. I have documented one we had in Opera and forced us to recover automatically. *unfortunately*. It also makes the task of creating a survey very hard because&#8230; well you get different markup, redirections, etc. aka results because of the user agent sniffing.

See [Wrong To Be Right - application/xhtml+xml][1]

For stats, there are two big surveys which have been made in the past (maybe it is what Tab refers to)

PS: Erik, you can also rely on XHTML5. Aka serving your document as application/xhtml+xml, expect issues with browser market shares in some countries.
