<PRE>Thanks Hugh. I had mistakenly been thinking of XHTML5 as something that
never happened rather than merely HTML5 served as XML which hadn't really
occurred to me as being a viable option. I look forward to messing with
this. This is precisely what I wanted to be able to do.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if this double-posted but I think I forgot to CC the list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Browser vendor politics I can understand but if we're going to talk about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what &quot;history shows&quot; about people like myself suggesting features we
</I>&gt;<i> can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually support I'd like to see some studies that contradict the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experiences I've had as a web ui developer for the last five years.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Everybody seems on board with providing a JavaScript strict mode. How is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this any different? Do people blame the vendors when vars they try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; define without a var keyword break their strict-mode code? Do we fret
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all the js out there that's not written in strict mode?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And HTML5 has found the key to eliminating the political issue, I should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think. Don't just worry about the rules for when the authors get it
</I>&gt;<i> right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Explicitly spell out the rules for how to handle it when they get it
</I>&gt;<i> wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How can you blame the browser for strict mode face plants when every
</I>&gt;<i> modern
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser including IE goes about face-planting in exactly the same way?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure, I could integrate in-editor validation into my process, but why add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to bloat to any number of tools I might be  using for any number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different stacks when we had something I know worked for a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers who were all as confused as I was when people inexplicably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started shouting about XHTML strict's &quot;failure&quot; from the rooftops.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there some unspoken concern here? If there is, I'll shut up and try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find out what it is through other means but I really don't see the logic
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not having some strict provision for authors who want it. How hard is it
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plug in an XML validator and rip out the namespace bits if that's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something we want to deal with just yet and propose a set of behaviors
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when your HTML5 isn't compliant with a stricter syntax?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because yes, these bugs can be kinda nasty when you don't think to check
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make sure your HTML is well-formed and it's the kind of stuff that can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily slide into production as difficult-to-diagnose edge-cases. Believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me. Front-liner here. It's an issue. Markup is where presentation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior, content, client-side, and server-side meet. I'm comfortable
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; letting people embrace their own philosophies but I like my markup to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; done right in the first place and visible breakage or at least browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; console error messages is the easiest and most obvious way to discover
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it isn't. And I developed that philosophy from my experience moving from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less strict to strict markup, not just toeing some weird technorati
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political line or zeitgeist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's nothing stopping you from writing XHTML5. This is what I do
</I>&gt;<i> for exactly the reasons you describe. If you write polyglot documents,
</I>&gt;<i> you can use application/xhtml+xml in development, serve text/html in
</I>&gt;<i> production and still sleep at night. Hell, these days you can even
</I>&gt;<i> serve application/xhtml+xml in production if IE &lt; 9 isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> significant market segment for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
