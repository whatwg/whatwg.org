Sure, I see no reason why not.

</I>
Well, I would say there are several advantages. First of all, JSON-LD is
more flexible and expressive. It has support for string
internationalization, data typing, lists etc. It also allows to distinguish
between IRIs and literals (which isn't the case for
application/microdata+json) which is important for Linked Data application.
Secondly, there is an API for JSON-LD to reframe [1] a document into a shape
that might be easier to work with in a web app (I think that's the whole
point of microdata+json or am I wrong?). Other API calls allow e.g. to
convert to and from RDF [2]. If you are interested, there is an online
JSON-LD playground [3] where you can play with the various API calls. Last
but not least it would also make web developers life easier if there are
fewer formats to support/learn.
