The solution described there seems somewhat overly complicated, but the 
implicit problem described there is an interesting one: how to avoid 
having to give media queries over and over again.

I don't think this is necessarily an issue for responsive images, per se, 
since with images there's the extra problem of declaring the pixel density 
of the images, and you have to give the max device height and width for 
the images, not so much a media query. But it may be worth looking at 
whether something along these lines could be done with an extension to CSS 
variables.

Media queries are a condition on the display, not metadata for the image, 
which is what we need here.

</I>
I don't really understand how this would result in different CSS. Surely 
you need to change more than just the images used in the various CSS 
sheets, so just having a variable for URLs isn't sufficient.

If the user is providing a single image, it seems like the simplest 
solution is to have the user upload a high-res image and have the CMS 
down-convert it as appropriate. That's essentially what Google Plus does, 
for example, when you provide your profile image: the image is resized for 
all the various places where it is used.

A single image isn't enough for most advanced uses though (where different 
sizes get subtly, or not so subtly, different images).

For the presentational aspects, the problem seems like it would be best 
kept to the CSS file, and not kept in the HTML file at all. After all, the 
whole point of CSS is that you can apply it to an HTML file that doesn't 
know about it, and change the look entirely. This is why I think it would 
make sense to look into recasting your idea into a CSS-variables-style 
mechanism, rather than an HTML one.

The UA picks the landscape.png image unless the viewport width is 500 
pixels or less. This works the same as media queries, which are presumably 
what the author is using to change the layout. Why is this a problem?

As far as I can tell, srcset=&quot;&quot; handles both cases. Which case do you

What is it in the spec that leads you to conclude that the user agent can 
pick an arbitrary resource? The spec is supposed to be written so as to 
make sure the browser picks a predictable image in any particular case, 
using an algorithm very similar to media queries.

Can you elaborate on why? How is it insufficient for that case? The Obama

indesigning srcset=&quot;&quot;, and it seems to work fine.

I can believe that the spec is confusing, certainly. If it would help to 
have some more examples in the spec of how to use srcset=&quot;&quot;, I would be 
happy to add some -- probably the best way to do that is if you suggested 
some real-world cases that you are not sure how to reimplement with 
srcset=&quot;&quot;, and I just went ahead and wrote a section that explained how to 
do those cases.

</I>&gt;<i>              a-square.png 100w 100h 1x&quot;&gt;
</I>
You would do:

   &lt;img id=a src=&quot;a-rectangle.png&quot; srcset=&quot;a-square.png 600w&quot; alt=...&gt;

If you wanted to control the img element's dimensions, e.g. to make sure 
you didn't have reflow when the image was loaded, you could also add this 
bit of CSS:

   img#a { width: 300px; height: 150px; }
   @media all and (max-width: 600px) {
     img#a { width: 100px; height: 100px; }
   }

Other way around; the biggest image goes in src=&quot;&quot;, and the *w descriptor 
gives the maximum width.

I think the image in this example is supposed to be half the width of the 
viewport (that is, the images are all 1x resolution).

The problem is that this kind of metadata gets out of date _really_

I don't really understand why.

However, once image-set() is more widely used, it may be that this problem 
goes away, because srcset=&quot;&quot; is basically the same concept.

Well, one day to learn a new feature that was only specified the day

Viewport dimensions are in CSS pixels, so that's what the spec uses.

'em', when the style sheets aren't loaded (as they are not when the

Well, pretty much all the other units (except ex) are a direct fixed 
multiple of CSS pixels. 1em = 16px, 1in = 96px, etc.

Well if you're changing the widths at which the layout significantly 
changes, presumably you're also going to need to change the images for 
those different layouts as well. So I'm not sure that's really an issue.

Having said that, I wouldn't object to integrating srcset=&quot;&quot; with a 
mechanism for pre-declared layout switch dimensions if such a mechanism 
were to be adopted. It would be relatively easy to add.

Let's start small, though.

The way srcset=&quot;&quot; is designed, it works fine with preloaders.

Right. It can see the &lt;img&gt; elements before it has fetched any other 
resources, including style sheets or scripts.

And bluntly, because user agent implementors have said they won't 
implement something that doesn't support preloading (or rather, loading 
during look-ahead parsing).

of your page is changing width, then all your &lt;img srcset=&quot;&quot;&gt;s are going 
to need changing... but so will all your images, for that matter -- e.g. 
if you're changing your layout from a 400px column to a 600px column, 
you'll need to go back to the masters and regenerate new &quot;full-bleed&quot; 
images at 600px instead of 400px. It's a lot of work, but I'm not sure 
really that the srcset=&quot;&quot; part of the work is the big part.

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps that's a use case to put up on the wiki, the whole left bar

I don't think _any_ of the networks I use on a regular basis have

whether one of my neighbours is trying to use bittorrent to download the

Yes. You'll also have to create new assets (which is a far more difficult

Well, most images are going to be decorative and thus done in CSS, so I

</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;source src=&quot;photo-l.jpg&quot; media=&quot;min-width:641px&quot;/&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;source src=&quot;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">photo-l at 2x.jpg</A>&quot; media=&quot;min-width:641px and min-device-pixel-ratio:2&quot;/&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;photo-s.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/picture&gt;
</I>
This is what this looks like with srcset=&quot;&quot;:

&lt;img alt=&quot;...&quot; src=&quot;photo-s.jpg&quot;
     srcset=&quot;photo-s.jpg   320w, <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">photo-s at 2x.jpg</A>   320w 2x,
             photo-m.jpg   640w, <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">photo-m at 2x.jpg</A>   640w 2x,
             photo-l.jpg  1280w, <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">photo-l at 2x.jpg</A>  1280w 2x,
             photo-xl.jpg    1x, <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">photo-xl at 2x.jpg</A>       2x&quot;&gt;

I really don't see in what way srcset=&quot;&quot; is less intuitive or more 
error-prone. It seems like a significant win to me. (The way you have to 
say &quot;1x&quot; for the photo-xl.jpg in this example is a result of trying to 
have the &lt;img&gt; fallback to photo-s.jpg rather than photo-xl.jpg; if it was 
the latter, you could just omit the latter altogether in the srcset=&quot;&quot;. In 
practice I imagine that's what would be more common since that's what you 
would want for fallback in legacy desktop browsers.)

1em = 16px before layout. Unfortunately we can't depend on layout, but it

In practice, the default font size on the Web has to be 16px, or sites 
break. I understand that some browsers (fewer and fewer over time) let you 
change that or have different defaults, but fundamentally IMHO they're 
just broken.

Why can't you just do:

Nah, if you're consistent then it becomes really quite easy to write

Can you elaborate on the concrete use case for orientation? When would you 
want to use a different image if you are on a 640x480 display than a 
640x1280 display, say?

I can see wanting to do scrolling in a different direction (e.g. the way 
the Google+ tablet app does) but it's not clear to me when this would 
affect content images (as opposed to presentation images in CSS).

No, quite the contrary. The alt=&quot;&quot; attribute is about the image's

they'd all have the same alternative text.

There's a long section on this in the spec that I recommend reading.

This is certainly an interesting use case. This is the first time I've 
heard someone suggest that we should give user agents the ability to 
switch in different images based on the user's need for higher contrast.

Before we specify such a feature, there are two big questions that need 
answering, though:

 1. Are any browser vendors interested in implementing such a feature?

 2. Have any authors provided such features on their sites today, and 
    would they want to rely on browsers to do it instead?

Given that I'm currently replying to a thread with over 300 messages on

A CG is just a mailing list and a blog, as far as I can tell, same as the

feedback from which gets forwarded to this list. Anyone can post on the

on our Google+ page. If it would help if we posted regular invitations to

topics they want to talk about, though. We deal with thousands of topics 
each year, and each discussion spans many months, so it's not clear to me 
what topics we should post about. (The topic of responsive images, for 
example, started being discussed in earnest a year or two ago -- the most 
recent discussions cover only a small part of the whole timeline.)

We try to prioritise the needs of users over authors, authors over 
implementors, implementors over editors (me), and editors over theory. 
However, as a practical matter, implementors have the ultimate veto since 
if they don't implement something, neither users nor authors get it.

Whether something changes in the spec is based entirely on what technical 
feedback we receive, primarily driven by use cases and by reports of what 
problems a solution has. So far in this thread there has been very little 
technical feedback pointing to any specific problems with srcset=&quot;&quot;, so so 
far I haven't removed it (though I have added some non-normative material 
as others have suggested; see earlier in this e-mail).

Certainly nothing is set in stone; that's the whole point of a living 
standard. However, we do try to minimise churn, so changes generally only 
happen when new information comes to light.

The IRC discussion (and the URL you cite above) are the symptoms of my 
&quot;thinking out loud&quot; while going through all the feedback we've received on 
a topic, in this case the hundreds of e-mails over at least four months of 
feedback, which itself led directly from the previous time I dealt with 
feedback on the topic, which was a reply to a dozen e-mails or so in 
January, dealing with feedback going back to August 2011. It's the same 
process: people send e-mails to the list with use cases, I read them all 
then either respond with requests for more information, or, if there is 
enough information, update the spec to handle the use cases. With 
complicated topics I do &quot;think out loud&quot; on IRC, but that's not the start 
of the process, it's just my sanity-checking things. With high-profile 
topics like this where there's a lot of e-mail, it tends to spill over 
several days just because there's a lot of e-mail to reply to; when I 
reply to just a single short e-mail, it looks more like the IRC discussion 
is happening in realtime, but really it's the same thing.

I welcome any input by IRC, of course, but you shouldn't confuse this with 
&quot;the process&quot;. Insofar as we have any process at all, it's just posting to 
the mailing list. This is detailed here in the FAQ:

A bit of a simplification, but yet, in part that is one of the factors 
that contribute to the current design. More importantly, though, srcset 
has some technical advantages over a multiple-element solution:

 - it's closer to the solution to the similar problem that is being 
   resolved for CSS, namely image-set().

 - it doesn't involve multiple elements. Generally, processing models for 
   multi-element structures in the DOM are a disproportionate source of 
   trouble in a wide variety of areas:
    - they introduce the need for much more elaborate error handling,
      since they have multiple failure modes (what happens if one or 
      another element is found in another, or if the outer element has an 
      unexpected inner element?)
    - the processing model has to deal with changes more complicated than 
      just &quot;change&quot; (what if an element is added or removed, or moved?)
    - it introduces all kinds of complicated questions once you introduce 
      shadow trees (what if you bind something with a special child? what 
      if the shadow tree contains such a child?)
    - it introduces complexities in the algorithms to deal with unexpected
      text nodes, comment nodes, PIs, etc.
    - it introduces some complexity in the parser, because you have to 
      handle the case where you're only half-way through parsing the 
      &quot;parent&quot; element when you return to the event loop, with more 
      children elements to process (when does the processing model 
      start? what do you expose in the DOM API half-way through? etc).

 - it resolves the intrinsic sizing for high-res images issue discussed 
   earlier in this e-mail.

 - it's a lot less verbose.

The lesson we learnt from &lt;video&gt;/&lt;source&gt; isn't that the pattern is an 
easy choice. It's that we should avoid it if at all possible. :-)

This is not an issue with srcset=&quot;&quot; as commas cannot appear in URLs in the

They are still present in HTML, but they handle a different problem. The

Short of making the syntax more verbose by explicitly including the words

any way to really solve that.

That's only a problem if you want to avoid duplicating the name of the 
fallback image (in which case it defaults to the image for an 
infinite-large viewport at 1x). If you don't mind giving the image for an 
infinite viewport at 1x (by just giving the descriptor &quot;1x&quot;), then you 
don't have to worry about src=&quot;&quot; at all when dealing with srcset=&quot;&quot;.

I had to read that algorithm like three times before I agreed with you. If

I think asymmetry here isn't a big deal, because the axis is itself 
asymmetric. The minimum width is 0, the maximum width is infinite. So the

processing model that puts the fallback at the top end.


Note that all of this is merely a transitory issue. On the long term, I 
expect all UAs will support srcset=&quot;&quot; (or its equivalent, if we change to 
something else), and we'll be able to make src=&quot;&quot; optional.

Right, this is the tradeoff I'm trying to avoid.

(Also, people seem to like spaces around colons -- see bugs filed on 
WebVTT's options, for example -- and then you end up with a parsing 
nightmare, where things like &quot;a.png max-width: 200 min-width :100&quot; are 
value yet look nothing like what they mean.)


To be fair, I'm not too worried about the syntax being non-obvious at 
first blush, because so long as the syntax is mnemonic, it will be pretty 
easy to learn. This isn't something like microdata where you're likely to 
not have any good way to test it easily, it's more like CSS where you can 
test it immediately just by loading your page and resizing your window.

A keyword to mean &quot;infinite w, infinite h, 1x&quot; would make sense if it's

There's plenty of ways to confuse the user experience, e.g. by having the

How would you handle:

 - The user picks up his laptop and moves it further away from the wifi 
   hotspot, to somewhere with a lot of packet loss.

 - The user goes through a tunnel and his phone has to switch from 4G to 
   EDGE for a few minutes.

 - The user opens the page on day 1, and on day 5 reaches his bandwidth 
   cap and gets throttled to a tenth of the bandwidth.

 - While the page is loading, the user's roommate starts watching an 
   HD show on Hulu while his neighbour, also using the wife, starts 
   downloading a 4GB file on Bittorrent.

 - The user loads the page, and while he's using it the server gets 
   DDOSed and its ability to serve data is impaired.

 - Due to a network link router issue, half-way through the page load, 
   half the packets on the pipelined TCP stream end up routed around a
   path that is twice as long as the rest of the packets.

 - The user has a high-bandwidth link to intranet sites hosted on the same 
   yacht, but a satellite uplink for the rest of the network. A page on 
   the intranet has four images, three of which are given for 
   &quot;high-bandwidth&quot; connections and one for &quot;low-bandwidth&quot; connections. 
   The first two are hosted on the intranet, the latter two are hosted on 
   a host on the Internet. All four are on different subdomains of the 
   same domain (so their network position is indistinguishable).

In short, bandwidth is not constant, past performance is no guarantee of 
future results, it can change dramatically without notice, there's no way 
to determine the current available bandwidth, it's path-dependent, and 
it's host-dependent.

Having &quot;a,a, b&quot; mean something different than &quot;a, a, b&quot; seems even more

Introducing new syntaxes for things like URLs seems like asking for

Given the special meaning of &lt; and &gt; in HTML, that seems like asking for

We're actually using spaces to delimit, as recommended by the relevant

That's possible. After all, printers are commonly as high as 600dpi, many 
go even higher. (Of course, printers have much lower colour depths, which 
is part of the reason why they need the higher resolution.)

Also, browsers support page zoom, which artificially changes the pixel 
density by changing the definition of CSS pixel on the fly. If you want to 
provide images suitable for people who use page zoom, then you're going to 
need zoom levels above 2x.

Having it be consistent with src=&quot;&quot; certainly seems less confusing on the 
short and medium term. On the long term I agree that we're just adding 
boilerplate, though... once everyone uses 4x displays, in 500 years or 
whatever, it'll be a lot of extra typing:

   &lt;img srcset=&quot;handheld.sfi 200w 4x,
                desktop.sfi 2000w 4x,
                billboard.sfi 20000w 4x&quot; alt=&quot;...&quot;&gt;

Having said that, if it becomes a problem, we could always introduce a new 
attribute once things have settled on a single resolution, so it's not 
like it's the end of the world. For example, in the far future we could 
add a &quot;srcs&quot; attribute:

   &lt;img srcs=&quot;handheld.sfi 200w,
              desktop.sfi 2000w,
              billboard.sfi 20000w&quot; alt=&quot;...&quot;&gt;

...which acts like srcset=&quot;&quot; but defaults to 4x instead. Or maybe by then 
we'll have figured out an image format that magically does the right thing 
for any particular render width, and we can just do:

  &lt;img src=&quot;jupiter-holiday-home.smf&quot;&gt;

...and not have to worry about any of this.

I doubt this is the case. When we have four device pixels per CSS pixel,

Both, really. A 100x100 image-pixel 1x image will be drawn using 100x100 
CSS pixels, which on a 2x display is 200x200 device pixels. A 100x100

Could you elaborate on the use cases that it doesn't handle?

Such a format would certainly be a great thing here.


&gt;<i> The &quot;1x, 2x...&quot; syntax probably needs to be tweaked to accommodate such

</I>&gt;<i> srcset=&quot;standard.jpg 1x, progressive.prog 0.1-4x&quot;
</I>
Once it's widely supported, you would just give the highest resolution.

If such a format becomes supported, though, I agree that it's something we 
should add to aid migration. I'm reluctant to add something like that 
before it's a problem, though.


&gt;<i> As an aside, this syntax might work to mix raster images and vector

How would this differ from:

   srcset=&quot;foo.svg 0.5x, foo.jpg 1x&quot;

...?

That's an interesting idea. There's two reasons I don't think we should 
imply the multiplier: one is that many of the examples give many images 
and I think it would get really confusing to have the resolutions implied 
(e.g. consider the example immediately above, and how it would have to be 
written if we implied the multiplier); the other reason is that we need a 
descriptor to properly parse srcset=&quot;&quot; due to the URL being allowed to 
contain commas.

I studied this, but couldn't find any reason why it would be better than 
srcset=&quot;&quot;. It has a number of problems (such as those discussed earlier in 
this e-mail), and doesn't seem to do anything that srcset=&quot;&quot; doesn't do 
but which people want to do. (The one example that seems to not be handled 
by srcset=&quot;&quot; is the print alternative, but in practice when people want to 
do a print version they tend to use an entirely different page, not use 
alternative medium style sheets, and in my experience, they tend _not_ to 
change the images. Were this use case to become more widely desired, 
though, we would probably address it at a more general level than 
specifically with images, e.g. by introducing a global media=&quot;&quot; attribute 
in the style of XHTML2's media=&quot;&quot; attribute.) (The proposal does mention 
'em' units, but as they have to be processed before styling has begun they 
are really equivalent to root 'rem' units, i.e. relative to 'medium', and 
I believe that browsers will converge on fixing 'medium' at 16px, with 
whole-page-zoom being used to increase font size instead of font zoom. So 
'em' is just a fixed multiplier of 'px', and thus merely syntactic sugar.)

I did update the spec with examples derived from this proposal, though.

Even if it did work, we'd still need to address the use case that involves

I'm all for a new format that handles this, but in the absence of such a

No, the former has an intrinsic width of 600 CSS pixels, the latter an

Not listing the specific dimensions means:

 - every time you resize the window, you have to hit the network just in case
 - caching is basically entirely lost, since every dimension is a new URL
 - the server needs logic, which involves more CPU load than static images

Is the ability to specify the image dimensions that important?

Tab suggested to me once that if we wanted to support this, we could do it 
by introducing new descriptors, as in (my syntax, not his):

   &lt;img ... srcset=&quot;small.jpg 100w is 100x100,
                    <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">small at 2.jpg</A> 100w 2x is 100x100,
                    large.jpg 1000w is 500x400&quot;&gt;

If this is something people really need, we can add it, certainly. 
However, adding it in the way suggested above with &lt;source&gt; seems just as 
verbose as what would be possible today with &lt;style scoped&gt;:

   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;style scoped&gt;
     #a { width: 1024px; height: 300px; }
     @media (max-width: 1024px) { #a { width: 768px; height: 200px; } }
     @media (max-width: 768px) { #a { width: 320px; height: 100px; } }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;lare.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;small.jpg 768w, medium.jpg 1024w&quot;
         id=a alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;
