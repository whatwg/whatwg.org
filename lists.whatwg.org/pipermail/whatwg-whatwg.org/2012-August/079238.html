</I>&gt;<i> I defined &quot;320x120, 320.jpg 1x, 640.jpg 2x, 1280.jpg 4x, 2560.jpg 8x&quot; to

</I>&gt;<i> calculate the number of pixels of image data available in each dimension,
</I>&gt;<i> then it would pick the one that most appropriately matches the number of
</I>&gt;<i> device pixels the image is actually taking up in each dimension.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So for example &quot;1280.jpg 4x&quot; means that this image is 4 times larger than
</I>&gt;<i> the given intrinsic width of 320px. So sure, it would be suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> display on a hypothetical 4x display at 320px width; but the browser also
</I>&gt;<i> knows that it would be suitable for display on a 2x display at 640px width,
</I>&gt;<i> a 1.5x display at 853px width, and a 1x display at 1280px width. The browser
</I>&gt;<i> simply doesn't have that kind of information with the current srcset spec,
</I>&gt;<i> so it is forced to be act more dumbly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's assume that, instead, you're trying to serve two versions of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image: one for small screens and one for larger screens, and each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version has two resolutions.  In that case, you'd do this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;img style=&quot;width:100%&quot; srcset=&quot;320.jpg 1x 320w, 640.jpg 2x 320w,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1280.jpg 1x, 2560.jpg 2x&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that doesn't work! Let's look at some common devices for which it fails:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     360w 2x portrait Galaxy S III =&gt; 2560.jpg instead of 640.jpg!
</I>&gt;<i>     480w 1x landscape iPhone 3 =&gt; 1280.jpg instead of 640.jpg
</I>
The point of the w/h descriptors is to align with your media queries
to solve the &quot;art direction&quot; use-case, where different layouts may
demand images with different sizes/ratios which may be produced
differently (possibly generated from the same image, but with
different layouts or whatnot).

If one of your breakpoints was predicated on a &quot;max-width: 320px&quot; MQ,
then this is exactly what you want.  (This is probably not a great
breakpoint, since it's clearly focused on the iPhone and likely not
your content's actual breakpoint, but whatever.)

&gt;<i>     2560w 1x 30&quot; desktop =&gt; 1280.jpg instead of 2560.jpg
</I>
This is adequate.  In the olden days before srcset, you'd just get the
1280 version all the time.  Now, if you'd like, you can toss in an
additional breakpoint with a &quot;2560.jpg 2560w 1x&quot; and be fine.  It's
not *perfectly ideal*, but it's fine.

The problem with trying to be smarter is that you have to be very
careful to not mess with the &quot;art direction&quot; use-case.  It's
*possible* to improve the syntax in the future to handle your last
example better, but it needs to be done with care.


&gt;&gt;<i> Once again, using image-set() with MQ is *exactly* the same as the w
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and h descriptors in &lt;img srcset&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We needed image-set() for resolution negotiation because you *can't*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use MQ for that.  Attempting to would have *horrible* usability, as I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explain in &lt;<A HREF="http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4Hv0">http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b4Hv0</A>&gt;.  However, there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing wrong with using MQ for width/height negotiation; after all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's their primary purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I understand where you're coming from on this point. It still seems a
</I>&gt;<i> shame to have different syntax from srcset, and I feel one could justify
</I>&gt;<i> making them the same by thinking of w/h in css as a shorthand even though it
</I>&gt;<i> duplicates functionality. The benefits would include
</I>&gt;<i> - Same syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> - Avoid non-locality bugs due to paired image-sets being far apart in the
</I>&gt;<i> CSS (changing one image, but forgetting to change the narrower/wider
</I>&gt;<i> viewport one, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> - Avoid browsers potentially downloading both assets (because typically the
</I>&gt;<i> non-media-query one will be provided first, and some browsers might
</I>&gt;<i> immediately start downloading it).
</I>&gt;<i> - Easier to setup alternative images in a single .style.backgroundImage from
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript (can one even create media queries from JS?), so you don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to rely on window resize event listeners.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But perhaps these niggles are best solved with a more general way of doing
</I>&gt;<i> inline media queries... is anything in the works?
</I>
I'm not actively working on anything right now, but my plan is to push
for @media to be nestable inside of style blocks, so you can put the
declarations right next to each other.
