</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't think this is a good solution actually. In general, I think 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's good to always make the DOM reflect the behavior of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; document. I.e. it shouldn't matter how you arrived to a specific 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; DOM, be it through parsing of an incoming HTML stream, or by using 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; DOM-Core calls. Whenever we make an exception for that rule I think 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; we need to have a good reason for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think you misread what I wrote. Right now, there's no magic involved 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When you said &quot;the latter is the option I'm following for now&quot; I thought 
</I>&gt;<i> you referred to &quot;and Firefox and IE7/Win don't change any links&quot;. Is 
</I>&gt;<i> that not the case?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at the spec it doesn't mention anything special regarding DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> mutations at all, so that would indeed make me think that links are 
</I>&gt;<i> changed if a &lt;base&gt; element is inserted at the top of the &lt;head&gt; using 
</I>&gt;<i> the DOM.

I'm not sure what I meant by &quot;latter&quot; anymore. Indeed, in the dy
