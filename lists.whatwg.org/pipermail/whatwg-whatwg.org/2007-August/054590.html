<PRE>
I'm not exactly sure what the context of this e-mail was (it seemed to be 
a non-sequitur relative to its parent e-mail in the thread). It seems, 
however, that it was attempting to suggest a solution without describing 
the problem being solved, which makes it difficult to evaluate. I've 
mostly addressed the syntactical and factual statements in the e-mail 
below, but since it wasn't clear what problem was being addressed, no 
changes have been made to the spec.

</I>
You can unambiguously define the semantics of an element with many 
features, such as RDFa, class attributes, structured prose, etc. All it 
takes is a well-defined specification describing the conventions of the 
way the semantics are conveyed.


&gt;<i> one might think of an element class='author' being short for 
</I>&gt;<i> 'formattedAuthorValue'. where does 'formatted value' of this come in? 
</I>&gt;<i> the stylesheet. but this is all vague and based on assumptions. if your 
</I>&gt;<i> use case is common enough a standard way to describe it has been layed 
</I>&gt;<i> out on a microformat wiki somewhere..
</I>
I don't really follow.


&gt;<i> discovering/parsing RDFa is simpler than microformats as it doesn't need 
</I>&gt;<i> to be special-cased for each scenario,
</I>
I don't really see why you think RDFa needs any less special-casing than 
your typical Microformat.


&gt;<i> and unlike microformats is infinitely flexible in what it can represent 
</I>
Some might argue that the inflexibility of Microformats is part of its 
appeal, however.


&gt;<i> - doing so without requiring predefined classes or risking name conflict 
</I>&gt;<i> with existing 'non-semantic' classnames.
</I>
In practice, though, this hasn't really been a problem.


&gt;<i> attribute :property describes the property, so theres no confusion as to 
</I>&gt;<i> whether the class was just thrown in for styling purposes or was 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to mean something specific. the properties themselves are 
</I>&gt;<i> resolvable to URIs. eg, dc:modified becomes 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified,">http://purl.org/dc/terms/modified,</A> the agent can look up a document at 
</I>&gt;<i> this URL, discover the class is a subclass of 'dc:date', then 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically display the modified times on a calendar or timeline. 
</I>&gt;<i> likewise, you could define a 'horror:killed' attribute, benefit from the 
</I>&gt;<i> existing agents without requiring approval from the microformat gods..
</I>
Requiring &quot;approval&quot; (or rather, requiring a broad consensus) is always 
going to be important for the conveying of semantics to a wide audience, 
regardless of the syntax. Equivalently, when your audience is small, you 
don't need anyone's approval to do anything to convey semantics, again 
regardless of what your syntax is.


&gt;<i> so, everything you describe is solvable, and has already been thought 
</I>&gt;<i> about and solved in at least one way..
</I>
Indeed, many ways.


&gt;<i> also, microformats ses the automatically-tooltipped/human-readable 
</I>&gt;<i> 'title' attribute for the machine-readable encoded format (and the 
</I>&gt;<i> contents of this field are definitely not the 'title' but some sort of 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute value), which is bizarre on several levels... RDFa uses the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'content' attribute for this, preferring that over the innerHTML for the 
</I>&gt;<i> machine-readable format when it is available. im not sure whats worse - 
</I>&gt;<i> the nameclashing with existing web content, the unextensibility, or the 
</I>&gt;<i> reuse of existing attributein unidiomatic ways..
</I>
I recommend bringing up such issues with the Microformats community.


&gt;<i> RDFa is potentially a solution to your problems.
</I>
We're still trying to work out what the problems are, so it's not clear 
that one can establish what the solutions can be yet.
