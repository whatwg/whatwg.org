</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While not much in favor at first, I started to like the idea of

</I>&gt;<i> The only problem is that earlier specs left those semantics undefined,

</I>&gt;<i> class presentational).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So either we fix class, or we create a new attribute (role) (and leave 
</I>&gt;<i> class as a purely presentational hook for CSS? Hurk!). The advantage of

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;more semantic&quot; than class and start to use it inconsiderably...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd tend to think there are use cases where class is most appropriate

</I>&gt;<i> to date.

I agree entirely with the sentiment given above, but I don't know what to 
do about it. Suggestions? Is there some way to change the phrasing of the 
spec for class=&quot;&quot; to help here?
