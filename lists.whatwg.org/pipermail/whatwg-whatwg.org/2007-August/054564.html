<PRE>
This e-mail consists of replies to a few e-mails on the subject of links 
and link relationship types. No changes were made to the spec in response 
to these e-mails; if you reply, please indicate if you think something 
needs to change in the spec. Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #1: That the label you pick for the &quot;rel&quot; (or &quot;rev&quot;) needs to be a noun.  
</I>&gt;<i> (I do understand why... at least I think I do... so that you can use the 
</I>&gt;<i> same label in the &quot;class&quot; attribute.  But it makes things difficult for 
</I>&gt;<i> some people.)
</I>
As others noted, the label you should pick for &quot;rel&quot; should be taken from 
a specific set of labels defined in a specification (either HTML4, or 
HTML5, or a Microformat spec, or some other extension specification). So 
the &quot;noun&quot; aspect isn't a source of confusion as far as I can tell. It may 
be that people don't know you shouldn't just arbitrarily make up now 
names, though.


&gt;<i> #2: That &quot;rel&quot; (and &quot;rev&quot;) represent a relation between the two.  Often 
</I>&gt;<i> people seem to want to &quot;classify&quot; what's at the end of the &quot;href&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> (Instead of specifying a relation.)  Perhaps a new attribute is needed.  
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps &quot;hrefclass&quot;.
</I>
&quot;class&quot; on an &lt;a&gt; element can be used for this, IMHO.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The semantics here are....  The class-xoxo (on the &lt;li&gt;) says that I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> giving a list here.
</I>
I assume you meant to use an &lt;ol&gt; on the outside, not an &lt;li&gt;. And in that 
case, it's the &lt;ol&gt; that says that you're giving a list, the xoxo class 
isn't necesarry to give the &quot;list&quot; semantic.


&gt;<i> And the class-shows says this thing is/has &quot;shows&quot;. (So basically, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> listing shows.)
</I>
This isn't a strong semantic (a random person who doesn't know you 
wouldn't necessarily know that's what your class meant), but it can be a 
convention you use within a particular community, sure.


&gt;<i> The rel-show inside the &quot;list of shows&quot;, says what's at the end of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;href&quot; is a &quot;show&quot; for the list of &quot;shows&quot;.
</I>
You could easily use &quot;class&quot; on the &lt;a&gt; element for this, without risking 
a clash with a future value introduced in (say) HTML6 for slideshow links. 
It would be as solid, semantically.

If you wanted to go further, you'd have to define a specification for your 
rel or class &quot;show&quot; value. Your specification could then include the rest 
of your description:

&gt;<i> So,... if you go to the URL in the &quot;href&quot;, you get a whole HTML page 
</I>&gt;<i> with all sort of stuff in there.  But what is the &quot;show&quot;?  The whole 
</I>&gt;<i> page?  Just part of it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I then search the page for class-show.  (I look for something 
</I>&gt;<i> inside the page with a class with the same token/name use in the &quot;rel&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> that linked there.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I find (just) one, then great, that's probably what I want to 
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate on.  (The other parts of the page are probably irrelevent.)  
</I>&gt;<i> If not, I'll probably have to concentrate on the whole page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (This is the idea of opaque semantics that I was talking about before.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does that clear it up?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (This is what I imagined the developers of these things originally 
</I>&gt;<i> thought up.)
</I>

&gt;<i> I suggested &quot;hrefclass&quot; because we already have things like... &quot;lang&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;hreflang&quot;.  It just seemed to follow the same style.  (Since this 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be just like the &quot;class&quot; attribute, expect we are applying it 
</I>&gt;<i> to what is at the end of the &quot;href&quot;... so &quot;hrefclass&quot;.)
</I>
I don't really understand why you can't just apply it to the link itself 
(i.e. use &quot;class&quot;).

Could you check the HTML5 spec and let me know if it can still be 
interpreted this way?


&gt;<i> For an example that's gained some popularity, look at hCard. 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People wanted to semantically denote &quot;contact info&quot;.  So they choose a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Creating the standard is a somewhat arbitrury process.  And requires 
</I>&gt;<i> humans to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although with opaque semantics, like the &quot;rel&quot; name matching the &quot;class&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> name, you don't need a human intervention to parse much of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does what I'm saying make sense?  Or should I explain it more?
</I>
I'm not convinced there's really a use case for making this automated to 
the level that you describe. It seems best to stick to having 
specifications for the cases that actually have uses.


&gt;<i> Alot of this is done for the benefit of machines (like browsers, 
</I>&gt;<i> spiders, search engines, etc).
</I>
Right now, everything is done for the benefit of humans. The machines are 
just tools.


&gt;<i> But getting back to one things you said... it is NOT always the case 
</I>&gt;<i> that you can &quot;grab&quot; something with an &quot;id&quot;.  Sometimes using &quot;class&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> works better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, consider if I wrote an article.  And, in the HTML for that 
</I>&gt;<i> article, I mark certain parts of it as being part of a &quot;summary&quot; for it. 
</I>&gt;<i> For example....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah
</I>&gt;<i> blah blah.&lt;/span&gt; Blah blah.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Blah blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah.
</I>&gt;<i> Blah blah.  &lt;span class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Blah blah blah.&lt;/span&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah.  Blah blah blah blah. Blah blah.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How would I grab that with an &quot;id&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The class-summary's in there let me get at the summary that spread out 
</I>&gt;<i> in multiple fragments.
</I>
What if the class isn't there? Why is the class different than the ID?


&gt;<i> Just one other example for good measure.  Consider this code...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I am &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://changelog.ca/">http://changelog.ca/</A>&quot;&gt;Charles Iliya Krempeaux&lt;/a&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a human you can understand what that means.  You know it is a 
</I>&gt;<i> statement. You know &quot;Charles Iliya Krempeaux&quot; is a name.  You know that 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot; <A HREF="http://changelog.ca/">http://changelog.ca/</A>&quot; is the site for &quot;Charles Iliya Krempeaux&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But a machines does not know that.  It cannot figure that out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's where some &quot;semantic salt&quot; can be helpful.  hCard's let us add a 
</I>&gt;<i> little semantics to make it so machines can figure out the &quot;name&quot; part 
</I>&gt;<i> of it too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if I were add an hCard I'd get...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I am &lt;a class=&quot;vcard fn url&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://changelog.ca/">http://changelog.ca/</A>&quot;&gt;Charles Iliya
</I>&gt;<i> Krempeaux&lt;/a&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (The class-vcard, class-fn, and class-url are all part of hCard.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With just that, machines now know that &quot;Charles Iliya Krempeaux&quot; is a 
</I>&gt;<i> name. And &quot;<A HREF="http://changelog.ca">http://changelog.ca</A>&quot; is the site for &quot;Charles Iliya 
</I>&gt;<i> Krempeaux&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could even add more semantics....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I am &lt;a class=&quot;vcard fn url&quot; href=&quot;<A HREF="http://changelog.ca/">http://changelog.ca/</A>&quot;&gt;&lt;span
</I>&gt;<i> class=&quot;given-name&quot;&gt;Charles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;additional-name&quot;&gt;Iliya&lt;/span&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span class=&quot;family-name&quot;&gt;Krempeaux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, not only does it know that &quot;Charles Iliya Krempeaux&quot; is a name.  
</I>&gt;<i> But it also knows that &quot;Charles&quot; is the person's &quot;given name&quot;.  That 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Iliya&quot; is that person's &quot;additional name&quot;.  And that &quot;Krempeaux&quot; is 
</I>&gt;<i> that person's &quot;family name&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (If you are coming from an XML point-of-view.  Using the class names for 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics is almost like entangling XML within HTML.  If that makes 
</I>&gt;<i> sense.)
</I>
With you so far... But so what? As you say, this all works. Why do we need 
a generic mechanism? The only reason the computer &quot;knows&quot; that Krempeaux 
is your family name is because someone wrote a spec for class=family-name. 
It's not automatic, how can it be?
