<PRE>
I've moved the cross-document messaging API postMessage() to Window 
instead of Document. I haven't otherwise changed it. I know it's not what 
everyone wanted, but the various requests were somewhat incompatible so 
someone had to not get what they wanted. :-) In particular, I haven't 
change postMessage() to be on the source Window instead of the target 
Window, since we had implementation feedback in both directions.

</I>&gt;<i> First, on a less substantial note: I agree with the spec note that this

</I>&gt;<i> principal is the same for the entire bundle -- it's tied to the window, 
</I>&gt;<i> not to the document.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> Also, in my skim of Mozilla's Window implementation, it seems to contain 
</I>&gt;<i> far more of the methods with security considerations, whereas the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTMLDocument implementation contains fewer; I think concentrating the 
</I>&gt;<i> security-conscious methods in fewer locations and greater quantities is 
</I>&gt;<i> a good idea.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> (It would be nice if the XSS concern mentioned in the note were 
</I>&gt;<i> explained, because I'm not sure to what it refers, and it might 
</I>&gt;<i> conceivably affect my opinion here.)
</I>
I'm not sure what you're referring to here.


&gt;<i> Second: as currently specified, postMessage (section 6.4, cross-domain 
</I>&gt;<i> messaging), requires that an implementation &quot;punch&quot; a hole through its 
</I>&gt;<i> security specifically for calls to postMessage on windows (assuming it 
</I>&gt;<i> were moved to Window), as well as possibly for enumerating a window's 
</I>&gt;<i> properties, doing |&quot;postMessage&quot; in win| checks, and ensuring that 
</I>&gt;<i> |win.postMessage| doesn't refer to a function that |win| might have 
</I>&gt;<i> defined in a custom modification (if the property weren't 
</I>&gt;<i> ReadOnly+DontDelete; the spec doesn't mention).
</I>
Yes, this is already quite common on Window for several other APIs.


&gt;<i> I was discussing this with a friend recently, and he made the following 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion: why not instead change the API to |postMessage(message, 
</I>&gt;<i> otherWindow)|, such that sending a message to another window involves 
</I>&gt;<i> getting the other window and calling |postMessage| on *your* window?  
</I>&gt;<i> It's already possible to acquire and use objects associated with other 
</I>&gt;<i> browsing contexts, and you can even pass them to APIs (usually you'll 
</I>&gt;<i> get an error, but it's not a guard-dog -- it's an error raised by that 
</I>&gt;<i> specific method).  This removes the need to punch the hole to make 
</I>&gt;<i> |postMessage| available to any script, and it means only postMessage 
</I>&gt;<i> itself (and not other pieces of the browser's security code) needs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to punch same-origin holes -- a significantly smaller change 
</I>&gt;<i> security-wise, and much easier to audit and reason about.
</I>
This is not a bad argument, but I think it is neater to call the method on 
the target window (and easier to understand at a glance).

The security issue would be more of a problem if there wasn't such a 
precedent for carefully crafted holes in the Window object.

I apologise for making your life harder, but I hope that leaving it as it 
is in the spec will not prove to be a huge blocker for you.

</I>&gt;<i> Second, in the interests of explicitness, we should be clear about the 
</I>&gt;<i> exact values of event.domain and event.uri.  Two concerns: how does 
</I>&gt;<i> setting document.domain interact with the computed value for 
</I>&gt;<i> event.domain, and what are the contents of event.domain in the presence 
</I>&gt;<i> of default and non-default ports?  I think the answers to these two 
</I>&gt;<i> concerns must be as follows.  Setting document.domain must have no 
</I>&gt;<i> effect on the value of event.domain, in the interests of web hosts who 
</I>&gt;<i> host content on subdomains of their main domain, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> myhomepage.webhost.com and webhost.com (else it would allow spoofing in 
</I>&gt;<i> pages which listened for cross-domain messages but didn't check the 
</I>&gt;<i> uri).  The contents of event.domain must include the port number iff it 
</I>&gt;<i> is not the default port number for the protocol (80 for http, 443 for 
</I>&gt;<i> https) and must omit it otherwise.
</I>
The domain is intended to only contain the domain (no port); the port and 
protocol can be obtained from the &quot;uri&quot; attribute if it is needed.

I've added a note to myself to fix this in due course.


&gt;<i> Third, with the modified API, the following is possible:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  // kidFrame is same-origin wrt window
</I>&gt;<i>  window.frames.kidFrame.postMessage(otherWindow, message);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the current design, this would basically allow a window to send an 
</I>&gt;<i> event which looks as though it has been created by another (same-origin, 
</I>&gt;<i> or joined-principals via document.domain) window, with a different 
</I>&gt;<i> event.uri. Since the two windows are same-session this probably isn't a 
</I>&gt;<i> real concern, but I think it's worth mentioning that the change makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to send a message from a window different from the one 
</I>&gt;<i> currently executing the script.
</I>
This is actually a good argument against it, IMHO, though of course since 
you can use dispatchEvent() you can always fake the event in this kind of 
situation.


&gt;<i> Fourth, and probably most importantly, is the event dispatched by 
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage dispatched synchronously (event fired and processed before 
</I>&gt;<i> postMessage returns) or asynchronously?  I interpret the current wording 
</I>&gt;<i> to mean synchronously, in accordance with the DOM 3 Events section on 
</I>&gt;<i> reentrance, but I'd like to be clear that's the intended interpretation.
</I>
Clarified in the spec.
