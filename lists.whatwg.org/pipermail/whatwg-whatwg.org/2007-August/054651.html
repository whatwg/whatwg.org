<PRE>
There was a lot of feedback regarding alt=&quot;&quot; on &lt;img&gt; elements. I've taken 
it all into account and revamped the relevant section of the spec:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-embedded.html#the-img">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-embedded.html#the-img</A>

Don't all scream at once; there are some controversial changes in there 
but I think the overall effect improves matters for the imageless. I 
couldn't make everyone happy, so there's bound to be things you disagree 
with. Read on for the reasoning in response to the e-mails that had been 
sent on this issue over the last two and a half years.

The spec as it stands now makes a distinction between alt=&quot;&quot; and no alt. 
The former is a decorative image; the latter is an image that is missing 
alternative text (either because it's a server-generated page and the 
server has no idea what the alt text should be, or because the image 
really is a core part of the page and the amount of alt text that would be 
needed to convey the same as the image is far more than the author will be 
willing to write).

I think that's more useful than simply implying alt=&quot;&quot;. What do you think?

I tried to make the spec convey this in the requirements on alt text.

</I>&gt;<i> For a while I've been honing a clearer definition of the alt= attribute,

</I>&gt;<i> Applications 1.0 draft, my text may be useful.
</I>
I ended up with a far more wordy version. Let me know if you think it's 
too wordy.

I think verbosity here is something worth trying. We've tried being brief 
before (e.g. HTML4) and it hasn't worked.


&gt;<i> In HTML 4 alt= is an attribute for &lt;img&gt;, &lt;applet&gt;, and &lt;input&gt;. I can think
</I>&gt;<i> of no reason for &lt;input alt= to exist
</I>
It's for &lt;input type=image&gt;.


&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;Since the two representations are alternate, not supplementary, a 
</I>&gt;<i> user agent should render either an image or its alternate text but not 
</I>&gt;<i> both at once. For example, a &lt;abbr&gt;UA&lt;/abbr&gt; should not show alternate 
</I>&gt;<i> text in a tooltip. Authors who wish to provide supplementary text for an 
</I>&gt;<i> image may use the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute instead.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>
I've noted that we'll have to say this in the rendering section.


&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;Specifying alternate text helps readers without graphic display 
</I>&gt;<i> terminals, visually impaired people, others who prefer listening to 
</I>&gt;<i> documents rather than viewing them, people viewing documents offline 
</I>&gt;<i> when an image is not available, and so on. To produce sensible alternate 
</I>&gt;<i> text, authors should follow these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;ul&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not describe the image. For example, do not write &lt;code class=&quot;bad
</I>&gt;<i> example&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;ExampleCorp logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code
</I>&gt;<i> class=&quot;bad example&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo.png (3890
</I>&gt;<i> bytes)&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, write text that fulfils the image&rsquo;s
</I>&gt;<i> purpose; for example, &lt;code class=&quot;good example&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img
</I>&gt;<i> src=&quot;logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Welcome to ExampleCorp&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A
</I>&gt;<i> description is appropriate only if the image itself is discussed but not
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere described in the document. For example: &lt;code class=&quot;good
</I>&gt;<i> example&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I managed to snap a photo of the animal. &lt;img
</I>&gt;<i> src=&quot;animal.jpg&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;It's a bit blurry, but it shows a large
</I>&gt;<i> brown creature running through the forest.&quot;&gt; At last, evidence of the
</I>&gt;<i> moa!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not provide alternate text for an image when it is used for
</I>&gt;<i> formatting, decoration, illustration, or linking to a solely graphical
</I>&gt;<i> resource. Instead, use &lt;code&gt;alt=&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. For example, a portrait of someone
</I>&gt;<i> should usually have &lt;code&gt;alt=&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, unless either their physical
</I>&gt;<i> appearance or the artwork itself is highly relevant and not described
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere in the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/ul&gt;
</I>
The above is basically covered by the new text. Let me know if there's 
anything you think we should add.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder why alt is a required attribute for IMG in HTML while an empty 
</I>&gt;<i> value is allowed.
</I>
The new spec distinguishes between these two cases, as described above.


&gt;<i> There are several arguments for making it optional:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Many authors still don't specify alt or specify alt=&quot;&quot; just to make 
</I>&gt;<i> the page validate. There's not much sense in requiring an alt when there 
</I>&gt;<i> is a way to not specify it (alt=&quot;&quot;), though it is a spec violation.
</I>
Note that although a validator tool might not catch it, giving the wrong 
alt text is now violation of a MUST requirement in the spec.


&gt;<i> 2. Empty attributes aren't very XPath friendly (actually, XPath isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> well equipped to work with empty attributes).
</I>
That wasn't a concern. :-)


&gt;<i> 3. If other elements, such as APPLET, also get the alt attribute, it 
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be optional to maintain backward compatibility. It would 
</I>&gt;<i> be inconsistent to require alt for IMG and have it optional for APPLET.
</I>
&lt;applet&gt; is gone, in favour of &lt;embed&gt; and &lt;object&gt;. (There doesn't seem 
to be any reason to have an element specific to Java when there's no 
element specific to Silverlight or any of the other proprietary or 
semi-proprietary languages that you can use on the Web.)

That's basically what we're at now, yes, though the spec now makes 
allowances for having the text be missing so as not to force people to 
include bogus alt text.

</I>
title=&quot;&quot; is different because title=&quot;&quot; means there's no title but the lack 
of an attribute means the parent's title applies.

That's sort of what has now been done.

Agreed, the spec now suggests using CSS where appropriate.

There are decorative ways to use &lt;img&gt; that are still page-specific 
&quot;content&quot;, and thus wouldn't really apply in CSS. The spec gives some 
examples now.

Too radical. :-) It's one of the most-used elements!

&lt;object&gt; has a number of legacy implementation issues, &lt;img&gt; is simpler to 
use. I think we want to keep &lt;img&gt; unless we have really good reasons not 
to (which I don't think we do).

It wasn't just me, but yeah, basically we were forced to not do it because

As the draft stands now, you might be able to get away with outputting 
a document that a validator can't find problems with, but that won't make 
it conforming.


&gt;<i> The bottom line is that requiring the presence of the alt attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> leads to a situation where UAs cannot tell whether the alt text is empty 
</I>&gt;<i> because the image is purely decorative or because the author did not

Indeed, this is the reasoning I followed.


&gt;<i> IMO, this leaves the people who don't see the images worse off compared

Right.

Spacer GIFs are non-conforming now.

It's not clear to me what that would mean. It sounds like it would allow

That's an interesting idea, though I'd expect people to not bother with 
the attribute since it wouldn't really do anything.

That doesn't help, e.g., blind users, or users who are driving a car and 
can't take their eyes off the road.

Yeah, the caption shouldn't be in the alt attribute.

The spec now allows this.

This is still there (in spirit if not in text) but now there is the 
absence of the alt attribute to use as indicator.


&gt;<i> Let's consider one archetypical use of the &lt;img&gt; tag in the wild, a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;IMG src=&quot;<A HREF="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> 178/392969604_a0887f39ce_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is right to say that this represents a piece of text

</I>&gt;<i> namely the linked photo. It's also not right to say that the image could 
</I>&gt;<i> be omitted without affecting the meaning of the document.  Although I 
</I>&gt;<i> entered a title of &quot;Frisson: White truffle &amp; wild rice&quot;, it would be a

</I>&gt;<i> meaning without any of the photos. Also, Flickr lets me have no title at 
</I>&gt;<i> all, or an ugly title based on the camera- chosen file name like 
</I>&gt;<i> DSC0981.JPG.
</I>
Agreed. The spec is now better on this front I think.


&gt;<i> Ian suggested that many uses of images on the web that aren't alternate 
</I>&gt;<i> graphical representations of text should be in the CSS layer. So maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> this should be &lt;div id=&quot;photo1&quot;&gt; with a &lt;style&gt;#photo1 { background: 
</I>&gt;<i> url(<A HREF="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/</A> 178/392969604_a0887f39ce_m.jpg); 
</I>&gt;<i> width 240; height: 180; }&lt;/style&gt; somewhere. But that doesn't make sense 
</I>&gt;<i> to me - the photos in my photostream aren't presentational and a 
</I>&gt;<i> stylesheet that replaced them with other images would not preserve the 
</I>&gt;<i> image in the page. Further, browsers often do not offer as good 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction with background images as the contents of an &lt;img&gt; element. 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, you can't drag a background image from the page to your 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop in any browser I know of. So that choice of markup would suck 
</I>&gt;<i> for the user, in addition to having the wrong split of presentation and 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> Although Flickr isn't what most people think of as a WYSIWYG editor, my

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, in conclusion, I think the stated meaning of &lt;img&gt; and the

Please let me know if you like the new text.

Indeed. I'm not sure what we can do about that here though.

The spec now handles all these explicitly. Let me know if it's not clear

I don't think authors would really use this reliably enough for it to be 
usable and useful.

The new spec doesn't require it.

Again, I'm not sure I see any evidence that authors would use this enough 
to make it useful. It seems better to just define the lack of alt as 
meaning this.

The nohref=&quot;&quot; attribute on &lt;area&gt;, which is in HTML4 but not HTML5, is a 
similar attribute. I think our experience with nohref=&quot;&quot; is that it's not 
a good way of going about this kind of thing.
