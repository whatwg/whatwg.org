I've now added URI and title parameters to pushState(), so we basically 
now have that.

</I>
I encourage you to do this. The more people we have looking at this with 
an eye towards how it can be abused, the better.

</I>&gt;<i>   location = &quot;#...some representation of the state of the page...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And you can bookmark that. The bigger problem is Google. Google afaik

</I>&gt;<i> location was &quot;<A HREF="http://www.example.com/#salesdep">http://www.example.com/#salesdep</A>&quot;, and everybody is 
</I>&gt;<i> linking to that location, there are 2 problems with Google:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Google doesn't support javascript. But it is impossible for the 
</I>&gt;<i> server to send a static page of the sales department, because fragment 
</I>&gt;<i> identifiers are not sent to the server with http requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Because of the links, Google will add the page to its database, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it will remove the fragment identifier. So even clients with javascript 
</I>&gt;<i> support will see the homepage instead of the sales department page, when 
</I>&gt;<i> they found the page through Google.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what we need is a way to change the path or the query part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> location, without getting a page reload. I think it works best (security 
</I>&gt;<i> etc) to just allow to change the query part. It would probably make the 
</I>&gt;<i> most sense to make this the second argument to pushState.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In our example we could do
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   history.pushState(data, &quot;salesdep&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and get <A HREF="http://www.example.com/?salesdep">http://www.example.com/?salesdep</A> in the address bar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When Google, or any other non-AJAX client, follows that URL you can let 
</I>&gt;<i> the server generate a static sales department page. AJAX clients get the 
</I>&gt;<i> basic site framework, and the client will read the query string and go 
</I>&gt;<i> to the sales department part.
</I>
You can now basically do what you request.

</I>&gt;<i> True. This is why I propose that pushState() to allow an URL as an 
</I>&gt;<i> argument, so it can behave in the same way as save() was suggested 
</I>&gt;<i> previously, but with a twist: some strict rules to as which URLs the 
</I>&gt;<i> author can use in the argument. Not a big twist, but it's something.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the author of <A HREF="http://www.example.com/test.htm">http://www.example.com/test.htm</A> should not be 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to insert in history a page from another TLD, domain or even 
</I>&gt;<i> subdomain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now a malicious web developer can still do bad things, like: flood the 
</I>&gt;<i> history. Yet, AFAIK, flooding/borking/braking the back button can be 
</I>&gt;<i> done with pushState() as currently defined, so not a big difference (or 
</I>&gt;<i> is it?). This is a problem similar to the alert() flood.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, the problem can be solved in the following way by UAs: block (or 
</I>&gt;<i> ask the user for confirmation) after a number of X pushed URLs in 
</I>&gt;<i> history by a page. This is something that can be applied to alert(s) 
</I>&gt;<i> too, yet in that case showing a checkbox can also be used (like in the 
</I>&gt;<i> good old Opera 6).
</I>
This is now possible too.

I agree, and I think that the abuse limitations on pushState() would have 
to be rate-limited or capped at a certain number, not based on how the 
method was invoked.
