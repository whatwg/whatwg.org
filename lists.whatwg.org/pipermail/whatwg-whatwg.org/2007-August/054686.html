I sympathize with your frustration, but I ask that you remain
patient.

I am in regular communication with Al Gilman about that June 6 message.
He understands that it may be some weeks/months before the HTML WG
has a considered response. (I think I just missed you yesterday, Al.)


The current priorities of this group,
as noted in the &quot;Current Events&quot; section of
our homepage <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/#current">http://www.w3.org/html/wg/#current</A>

 1. design principles
 2. initial reviews of the HTML 5 spec

These initial reviews are breadth-first; the goal is to raise
issues and awareness, but not to fully address all the issues
that come up, just yet.

I tried putting something else ahead of design principles,
namely a &quot;differences between HTML 4 and HTML 5&quot; document,
but there were formal objections that appealed to the
&quot;What should the HTML WG publish first?&quot; survey
  <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wd7/results">http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wd7/results</A>
which put the design principles ahead of the
spec, 34 to 25.

The back-log of comments on HTML specs goes back a lot
further than June of this year. In May, the editors
asked for a few months to deal with a backlog of
a few years of WHATWG feedback. It has now been a few
months, and I'm starting to re-negotiate priorities
with the editors.

But keep in mind that we have, so far, made *no* design
decisions. We haven't decided that HTML 5 will have a p element.
Before we address subtle issues like the table headers issue,
first we should deal with the fact that we're about 3
months overdue for releasing anything on <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/">http://www.w3.org/TR/</A>
for community review by finishing the current round of discussion
on design principles. Then I think we should tackle a few
no-brainer technical issues just to get a feel for the process.
And then we'll decide about table headers and that sort of thing.

I appreciate the testing and research that is going on meanwhile.
That's an essential part of quality design decision-making.

I recommend teleconferences as a good way to get a feel for
group priorities and schedule. For example, we talked
about the timing of this table headers issue last week.
