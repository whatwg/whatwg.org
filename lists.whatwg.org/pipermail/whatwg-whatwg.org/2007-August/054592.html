</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The keyword here is &quot;multiple&quot;. I was imagining a scenario where this

</I>&gt;<i> calendar widget, but also an email launcher, a spreadsheet manipulation 
</I>&gt;<i> widget, a website preference negotiation component, a payment service 
</I>&gt;<i> provider widget, and a context-sensitive application toolbar integrated 
</I>&gt;<i> with the main menu of a given site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of these might not be used on a single site, but it would still be 
</I>&gt;<i> very annoying to have a separate login for each and every component. 
</I>&gt;<i> That is why I mentioned the &quot;global login&quot; option in my original post. 
</I>&gt;<i> With a single login per browser session, this generalized mashup would 
</I>&gt;<i> actually scale; it's also useful as a general cross-site login method.
</I>
I agree, but this doesn't have to be implemented in the spec. Distributed 
decentralised single sign-on is addressed by things like OpenID. The 
system described above, with iframes pointing at widget meta-providers and 
having them redirect to widgets after login can still be done with a 
single login step without further help from the spec.


&gt;<i> One way to do this would be to have a URI-Specific Profile ID that acts 
</I>&gt;<i> as the combined username/password secret for a specific web resource. 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say that the client looks for a string like &quot;(*URISPID*)&quot; in all 
</I>&gt;<i> loaded URLs. If the string is found, it is replaced with an MD5 hash of 
</I>&gt;<i> a local user secret (username/password) combined with a part of the URL. 
</I>&gt;<i> If the client doesn't support this feature, the &quot;(*URISPID*)&quot; part is 
</I>&gt;<i> left unchanged, so the server can fall back to a traditional login page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, an access to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="https://www.example.com/interfaces/calendar/v1?id=(*URISPID*">https://www.example.com/interfaces/calendar/v1?id=(*URISPID*</A>)&amp;option=1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> could have its &quot;(*URISPID*)&quot; part replaced by
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   hash(hash(username + &quot;:&quot; + password) + &quot;:&quot; + base_url)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where base_url = &quot;<A HREF="https://www.example.com/interfaces/calendar/v1">https://www.example.com/interfaces/calendar/v1</A>&quot;.
</I>
That's possible, but I think it's better to decouple the solution from 
the HTML5 language here, in the manner of OpenID and others. We want to 
provide a platform on top of which this kind of thing can be built.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Item 3 highlights a privacy leak in the cross-document messaging API 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; specified in the current WA1 draft. It's clear that postMessage() 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; was not intended for this kind of scenario, since the domain 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; attribute will completely break any attempt to hide the two domains 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from each other.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hm, interesting. It's true that the current design leaks the domain. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You could get around that by having messages proxied through the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original redirecting domain, though; no privacy leak there since the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original domain is know to the embedding page and the chose widget 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provider has to be known to the middleman already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, in principle you don't want those messages to be exposed to the 
</I>&gt;<i> redirecting domain either, but I suppose that the interface publisher is 
</I>&gt;<i> more trusted than the other domains. Since the interface is central, any 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to pass private data back to the server would be noticed quickly 
</I>&gt;<i> by someone. Besides, if the redirecting domain isn't trusted, it can use 
</I>&gt;<i> the proxy iframe anyway, although we are actually expecting a redirect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This means that your workaround is most likely acceptable for this case, 
</I>&gt;<i> although I'm slightly worried that it might not cover other scenarios. 
</I>&gt;<i> In general, it's probably safer if the author must request to have the 
</I>&gt;<i> domain visible when it should be checked, rather than the other way 
</I>&gt;<i> around, since he may not remember to hide it when that is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I don't feel strongly about this, since I don't know if domain 
</I>&gt;<i> hiding will ever be strictly necessary. Let's just keep it in mind, so 
</I>&gt;<i> we don't make this hole in the same-origin policy bigger than it needs 
</I>&gt;<i> to be. Perhaps a hide/show flag argument to postMessage() is worth the 
</I>&gt;<i> extra trouble, just to stay on the safe side.
</I>
It's something to bear in mind if there's a need, I agree. I don't think 
we need it in the first version, though.

Cheers,
