&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is the DragEvent supposed to inherit from Event? Wouldn't at least

</I>
Changed.


&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with accessibility for drag and drop. Do platforms 
</I>&gt;<i> actually have a means of performing drag and drop that aren't mapped to 
</I>&gt;<i> mouse events?
</I>
Sure. Copy and paste, for example.


&gt;<i> &gt; The initDragEvent() and initDragEventNS()  methods must initialise the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event in a manner analogous to the similarly-named methods in the DOM3 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Events interfaces. [DOM3EVENTS]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There aren't any such methods in the DOM3 Events.
</I>
By &quot;similarly&quot; I meant &quot;similarly&quot;, not &quot;identically&quot;. As in, the 
initUIEvent() method, initMouseEvent() method, etc. In due course I'm 
hoping DOM Events 3 will have a terminology I can use to make this less 
ambiguous; until then I'll just leave it as is.


&gt;<i> What happens when a script creates a drag event by calling 
</I>&gt;<i> initDragEvent(NS) and dispatching it? Should dataTransfer always be 
</I>&gt;<i> empty is this case?
</I>
I've added dataTransfer to the init methods.


&gt;<i> Is the addElement method used solely for the purpose of setting the 
</I>&gt;<i> image for dragging? Or, does it imply that the element itself is being 
</I>&gt;<i> dragged? (And that, for instance, dragging it into an HTML editor might 
</I>&gt;<i> copy the source for the element)
</I>
The former. (The spec seems unambiguous on this point.)


&gt;<i> What happens if setData, setDragImage, or addElement are called during 
</I>&gt;<i> any of the drag events other than dragstart?
</I>
Nothing especially interesting. (Again, the spec details everything that 
happens, and since nothing is specified to happen for these cases, nothing 
happens.)


&gt;<i> 5.5.2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the chart, the dragend event has 'current drag target' listed for 
</I>&gt;<i> dropEffect, yet the text two paragraphs later says that this should be 
</I>&gt;<i> 'none'.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> 5.5.3
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What happens in the following case:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div draggable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;p&gt;This is some text. &lt;strong&gt;Stronger text&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Normally, starting a drag operation on html content, indicates to start 
</I>&gt;<i> a selection, not drag it. In the sample above, should a selection be 
</I>&gt;<i> started, or does this imply that the entire div is draggable when 
</I>&gt;<i> clicking and moving the mouse anywhere upon the text, and that it isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to select the text by starting a selection within it?
</I>
The latter, though nothing stops the user agent from letting the user 
select the text in some other fashion (e.g. using the keyboard, or by 
requiring a modifier key to be pressed, etc). This is similar to how it is 
not possible to select text that is part of a link in most browsers.


&gt;<i> &gt; If it is a selection that is being dragged, the dataTransfer member of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the event must have the text of the selection added to it as the data 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; associated with the text/plain format.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that the only format that should be available? Mozilla's internal 
</I>&gt;<i> drag and drop APIs also supplies a selection as serialized HTML using 
</I>&gt;<i> the format text/html (or images as an image type). Maybe the spec should 
</I>&gt;<i> clarify that the UA may supply additional formats if desired.
</I>
I've added an issue box for us to look into this.


&gt;<i> If the data isn't available until the drop, there really isn't any way 
</I>&gt;<i> to know what to set dropEffect to during dragenter or dragover events, 
</I>&gt;<i> since it isn't known by the current target whether the data can be 
</I>&gt;<i> dropped there, not what drag effect can be used. The only real option 
</I>&gt;<i> would be to say 'yes, something can be dropped here, but if you try to, 
</I>&gt;<i> we still might not let you, and the drag cursor was just plain wrong'. 
</I>&gt;<i> So why does the spec go into such detail about what the effect should 
</I>&gt;<i> be?
</I>
Well, if we want to expose this to authors, we have to define it.

I see your point, though. Maybe we should expose the types, at least? We 
can't expose the data for security/privacy reasons, but I could see 
arguments for exposing the types... is it safe enough? (I'm thinking a 
&quot;types&quot; subobject on dataTransfer, which is an enumerable list of types, 
e.g. a DOMStringList.)


&gt;<i> The spec makes no mention of the modifier keys when the drag is 
</I>&gt;<i> occurring. In fact, it seems to imply that the modifiers must be ignored 
</I>&gt;<i> when determining the drag cursor to use, and to use only the 
</I>&gt;<i> effectAllowed and dropEffect states. Normally, the modifier keys force a 
</I>&gt;<i> particular effect, if allowed, to be used.
</I>
Good point. I've added an issue to this effect. I haven't defined it yet 
because I need to look into how exactly to expose this -- other events 
have the same problem (in particular, the 'show' event for context menus).


&gt;<i> Just to clarify, the dragenter is sent to the current drop target, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then if not canceled, another dragenter event is dispatched at the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt;?
</I>
Yes (and the current drop target becomes the body).


&gt;<i> Is the dragend event fired regardless of whether a drop occurred? (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> was successful or canceled)
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> Typically, for move operations, the node may now be in the new location, 
</I>&gt;<i> should the dragend event still be fired?
</I>
It's always fired.


&gt;<i> Personally, I think that the behaviour of textbox drag and drop is 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation specific, and the spec shouldn't define how text gets 
</I>&gt;<i> moved or copied from/to them.
</I>
It's not really specified in that much detail; which part of what is 
specified now do you think should be removed, and why?
