</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/menu&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is conservative enough as it allows me to define typical menus.
</I>
Indeed, as I mentioned earlier the shortcut key feature is currently 
missing but will be added when we figure out the solution for the more 
general accesskey issue.


&gt;<i> All modern UAs have their own implementation of menus so they already 
</I>&gt;<i> can &quot;chew&quot; menu items with markup and styling.
</I>
The intent is to allow implementations to use native OS menu support.


&gt;<i> Otherwise &lt;menu&gt; should not use &lt;li&gt; but &lt;option&gt; or so. But this will 
</I>&gt;<i> not be backward compatible.
</I>
Well, as currently specced we can use &lt;select&gt; and thus &lt;option&gt;s in 
&lt;menu&gt;s already.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As you may see above, Windows XP/Vista, Gnome and KDE4 all use rich 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; menus. So it is not RiscOS only.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The three menus you mention above are all examples of a specific OS 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; launcher menu, they're not context menus. The feature under discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is currently intentionally limited in scope to just context menus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have definitions on what is context menu and what is not?
</I>
Sure, it's the type of menu you get (for instance) when control-clicking 
on the Mac or right-clicking on Windows, as opposed to the kind of menu 
you get from a menubar, menu button, or OS application launchers.


&gt;<i> Do you have any examples of exisiting web applications that will benefit 
</I>&gt;<i> significantly from having that flat puristic context menus?
</I>
Web applications widely have hacks for context menus today. For example, 
Google Maps and Live Search maps have simple context menus. Today they 
have to have non-native implementations that don't really work well and 
that interfere with the browser's features.


&gt;<i> So where this context menu feature request comes from?
</I>
It's a frequent request from Web app developers.


&gt;<i> BTW: Everything there works already without any HTML5.
</I>
Excellent!


&gt;<i> I believe that HTML5 goal is to provide more or less generic solution 
</I>&gt;<i> that can serve as simple menus *and* cover the whole class of popup 
</I>&gt;<i> elements and lightweight dialog needs.
</I>
Nope, that isn't the goal. We're aiming at 80% with the intent to keep the 
basic language simple and approachable.


&gt;<i> Otherwise we will end up with spending rest of our life adding that 
</I>&gt;<i> endless &lt;menu&gt;, &lt;rich-menu&gt;, &lt;popup&gt;, &lt;dialogue&gt;, &lt;monologue&gt;, &lt;novel&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;poem&gt;, &lt;haiku&gt;, whatever....
</I>
For things that HTML can't handle, authors have to fall back on CSS and 
JS, and (in the future) XBL, as I mentioned. I don't think we will ever 
need to specifically have a &lt;haiku&gt; element, for instance.


&gt;<i> &gt; While your enthusiasm for flexibility is commendable, we are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intentionally limiting the speed at which we add features to HTML5 to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prevent feature creep. Feature creep is often the cause of poor 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality implementations. We have to move slowly so that we can take 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into account implementation experience from multiple vendors 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (especially those with significant market share), and so that we can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make sure we are addressing the most desired features instead of only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the most unusual ones.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not an enthusiasm but rather frustration of where this thing is 
</I>&gt;<i> moving. As I said, proposed &lt;menu&gt; is not a solution. Just a cosmetic 
</I>&gt;<i> and limited feature that will solve some pretty small number of cases. 
</I>&gt;<i> If any.
</I>
I would argue that what we have in the spec now solves a good 80% of all 
needs for menus and tool bars. I don't think most people need pie menus, 
application launchers, complex markup in menus, etc.


&gt;<i> In any case I would like to know examples of existing web applications 
</I>&gt;<i> that such non-styleable menus.
</I>
I gave two earlier; Google Docs and Spreadsheets is another. Context menus 
that are &quot;non-styleable&quot; are used in almost all desktop applications, so 
any Web analogue to desktop applications could well want to use one. We 
frequently get requests for how to do this.
