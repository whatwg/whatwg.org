I disagree.  He is stating it as &quot;fact&quot;, when in reality it is the current
thinking.  If you are seeking feedback, then it is a proposal: re-read what
Lachlan has written, it does not sound like a proposal, but rather a firm
decision to which mozilla should be conforming to (it's a bug report!!!).


&gt;&gt;<i> * Is Maciej Stachowiak correct when he states, &quot;This feature is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> underspecified in HTML4, and not implemented by IE. It is also likely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be dropped in HTML5 and may be removed from Mozilla and Opera as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result.&quot; [<A HREF="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15032">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15032</A>]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I accept &quot;underspecified&quot; and &quot;likely to be dropped&quot; as his opinion,
</I>&gt;<i> and as far as I know he's correct that it's not implemented by IE. 
</I>
Fair enough, but by reading this, there is no indication that it is opinion,
and is further clouded by the fact that he is making a projection regarding
2 browser's &quot;future&quot; implementation/non-implementation, even though he does
not work for nor speak for either.  Failing to recognize that this is a
problem is of concern.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These types of pronouncements *do* tend to send mixed messages, don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you agree?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's an accurate reflection of the constituencies in the working
</I>&gt;<i> group: there are a variety of opinions. We could have chartered the
</I>&gt;<i> working group to keep its discussions member-confidential until we
</I>&gt;<i> reached consensus, but I don't think that would be better.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Clearly allowing any and all to espouse their opinion as de-facto &quot;decision&quot;
is not working either.
