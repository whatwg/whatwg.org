</I>
Evidently; i.e. perception is reality, and I'm getting complaints
about this weblog entry.

Anne, you and I have certainly talked about the connotations and
denotations of &quot;dropped&quot;.

Something like &quot;the editors are evidently inclined to drop
&lt;input usemap&gt;; it will be interesting to see whether any new
arguments come up&quot; perhaps wouldn't have generated as many complaints.

How about updating your weblog entry with something like that, Anne?

&gt;<i> * Is Lachlan Hunt definitive when stating, &quot;HTML5 now defines the usemap
</I>&gt;<i> attribute as a Hashed ID Reference, not a URI, and can only reference maps
</I>&gt;<i> within the same document.&quot;

He seems to be accurately quoting from current editor's drafts.
That seems like a useful way to get feedback from the 
mozilla development community, no?

It seems to me that in the bugzilla context, it's reasonably well
known that HTML 5 is a moving target. The Mozilla foundation
is reasonably well represented in this working group; I'm interested
to get confirmation as to whether this is business-as-usual
or something counter to norms there.


&gt;<i> * Is From Maciej Stachowiak correct when he states, &quot;This feature is
</I>&gt;<i> underspecified in HTML4, and not implemented by IE. It is also likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> dropped in HTML5 and may be removed from Mozilla and Opera as a result.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15032">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15032</A>]
</I>
I accept &quot;underspecified&quot; and &quot;likely to be dropped&quot; as his opinion,
and as far as I know he's correct that it's not implemented by IE.

&gt;<i> These types of pronouncements *do* tend to send mixed messages, don't you
</I>&gt;<i> agree?
</I>
Yes.

That's an accurate reflection of the constituencies in the working
group: there are a variety of opinions. We could have chartered
the working group to keep its discussions member-confidential until
we reached consensus, but I don't think that would be better.

&gt;<i>   If these authors/HTML 5 contributors can be categorically making
</I>&gt;<i> these kinds of statements, then is it not unreasonable to expect something
</I>&gt;<i> like, &quot;Based upon current feedback, the headers attribute will be preserved
</I>&gt;<i> in HTML5&quot; (attribute to whom you wish)?  
</I>
What I get from Al Gilman's 6 June message is that something that
provides the functionality of the headers attribute is needed.
He doesn't argue that the headers attribute is the only acceptable
solution.

I have seen a fair amount of test data fly by and I have
seen a lot of discussion of use cases. I have not digested it all yet.

&gt;<i> I know that these issues have been raised to you previously. If we are to
</I>&gt;<i> accept that it is still at the &quot;...*no* design decisions made...&quot; stage then
</I>&gt;<i> is it unreasonable for &quot;us&quot; to expect that these types of
</I>&gt;<i> statements/pronouncements cease from the editors?  Else, there will continue
</I>&gt;<i> to be a perception of &quot;what you say vs. what you do&quot; that outsiders will
</I>&gt;<i> continue to question (and continue to revisit - Lachlan's initial
</I>&gt;<i> complaint).
</I>
Indeed, until the issue is resolved, we all have to accept that it
will continue to be discussed and revisited.

&gt;<i> Respectfully,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JF
</I>&gt;<i>
