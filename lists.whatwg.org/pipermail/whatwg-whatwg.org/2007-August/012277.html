Changed.

Sure. Copy and paste, for example.

By &quot;similarly&quot; I meant &quot;similarly&quot;, not &quot;identically&quot;. As in, the 
initUIEvent() method, initMouseEvent() method, etc. In due course I'm 
hoping DOM Events 3 will have a terminology I can use to make this less 
ambiguous; until then I'll just leave it as is.


&gt;<i> What happens when a script creates a drag event by calling 
</I>&gt;<i> initDragEvent(NS) and dispatching it? Should dataTransfer always be 
</I>&gt;<i> empty is this case?
</I>
I've added dataTransfer to the init methods.


&gt;<i> Is the addElement method used solely for the purpose of setting the 
</I>&gt;<i> image for dragging? Or, does it imply that the element itself is being 
</I>&gt;<i> dragged? (And that, for instance, dragging it into an HTML editor might 
</I>&gt;<i> copy the source for the element)
</I>
The former. (The spec seems unambiguous on this point.)


&gt;<i> What happens if setData, setDragImage, or addElement are called during 
</I>&gt;<i> any of the drag events other than dragstart?
</I>
Nothing especially interesting. (Again, the spec details everything that 
happens, and since nothing is speci
