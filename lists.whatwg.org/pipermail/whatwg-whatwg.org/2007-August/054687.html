Dan,

Thank you for your prompt response.  While patience is indeed a virtue, my
(our?) patience is being sorely tested, as while the official word is that
we're nowhere near deciding anything, current editors and contributors are
going ahead and making &quot;pronouncements&quot; that lead many to believe that much
of HTML5 is 'fait accomplis'.  As someone once said to me, you can't suck
and blow at the same time.

To whit:  
* Is Anne (&quot;Standards Suck&quot;) van Kesteren out of place to be announcing that
HTML5 has dropped &lt;input usemap&gt;?
[<A HREF="http://annevankesteren.nl/2007/08/input-usemap">http://annevankesteren.nl/2007/08/input-usemap</A>]  

* Is Lachlan Hunt definitive when stating, &quot;HTML5 now defines the usemap
attribute as a Hashed ID Reference, not a URI, and can only reference maps
within the same document.&quot;
[<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189643">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=189643</A>], as well as &quot;HTML5
currently will not be including the usemap attribute on input elements.&quot;
[<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=392994">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=392994</A>]

* Is From Maciej Stachowiak correct when he states, &quot;This feature is
underspecified in HTML4, and not implemented by IE. It is also likely to be
dropped in HTML5 and may be removed from Mozilla and Opera as a result.&quot;
[<A HREF="http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15032">http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15032</A>]

 
These types of pronouncements *do* tend to send mixed messages, don't you
agree?  If these authors/HTML 5 contributors can be categorically making
these kinds of statements, then is it not unreasonable to expect something
like, &quot;Based upon current feedback, the headers attribute will be preserved
in HTML5&quot; (attribute to whom you wish)?  

I know that these issues have been raised to you previously. If we are to
accept that it is still at the &quot;...*no* design decisions made...&quot; stage then
is it unreasonable for &quot;us&quot; to expect that these types of
statements/pronouncements cease from the editors?  Else, there will continue
to be a perception of &quot;what you say vs. what you do&quot; that outsiders will
continue to question (and continue to revisit - Lachlan's initial
complaint).

Respectfully,

JF
