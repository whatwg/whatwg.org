It would be good for UAs to dim menu/submenu titles whenever all their 
items are disabled, if that's the platform UI convention (and perhaps 
even if it isn't). However, that's orthogonal to my suggestion.

I'm suggesting that since it is common for entire menus -- or toolbars 
-- to be temporarily irrelevant, such as when focus is in a field or 
pane where they do not apply, there should be a disabled= attribute for 
disabling an entire &lt;menu&gt;. When this attribute is present, all the 
&lt;menu&gt;'s items should be disabled, regardless of their individual 
disabled= attributes; when the &lt;menu&gt;'s disabled= attribute is removed, 
the disabled= attributes of the individual items should retake effect. 
This would save authors a lot of work that they might otherwise not 
bother with, thereby making their interfaces more responsive.

I do not think &quot;but the menu items might be duplicated in a toolbar&quot; is 
a strong counterargument. If the temporarily-irrelevant items are a 
subset of the items a toolbar, then yes, they will need disabling 
individually. But often it will be the entire toolbar that needs 
disabling, or the menu will not have equivalent items in a toolbar, or 
-- even more common in Web apps -- the toolbar will not have equivalent 
items in a menu.

&gt;<i> (Note that the Mac OS X guidelines seem to no longer have the quote you
</I>&gt;<i> give above.)
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Yes, they now say the opposite! I think that's a mistake, but in any 
case, that doesn't affect my suggestion. It would still be useful to 
make an entire menu disabled even if the platform UI convention is for 
disabled menu titles to look enabled.

Cheers
