I don't think that works very well - you'd have to parse all the HTML,  
CSS and scripts associated with those other pages just to do the  
caching. That's a huge cost compared to just downloading the  
resources. Consider web apps like flickr and upcoming which consist of  
many many pages. Obviously these specific examples can't cache all of  
their pages offline but they may well want to cache a significant  
subset that is interesting to the user.

I think it's easy to extend Ian's idea in a way that keeps it really  
simple for the simple case, but that works better for the multi-page  
case or other complex cases where pages load some resources dynamically.

&lt;html application=&quot;manifest-file&quot;&gt;

The manifest file would indicate all resources used by the web app,  
including other pages, and other resources that may be loaded by the  
current page but normally would not be at startup (another problem  
with Ian's proposal IMO). Multiple pages that refer to the same  
manifest are considered part of the same web app and share the same  
cache. If you give an empty value for the application attribute, then  
the implicit thing that Ian describes happens - the resources that the  
page actually loads are the ones cached.

My thoughts on this aren't fully fleshed out, but Ian said he wants to  
start editing the spec right away so I wanted to give this minimal  
feedback before he writes up something in detail that I would strongly  
object to.

Regards,
Maciej
