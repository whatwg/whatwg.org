To be frank, it seems like a lot of bloat though to avoid a simple comparison.


&gt;<i> - Less Listener Functions Fired - Instead of every registered listener

</I>&gt;<i> leading to potential performance improvements.
</I>
Actually, assuming only one of the two solutions would exist the same amount of events would fire. A change to localStorage causes an event to be dispatched and likewise a change to sessionStorage causes an event to be dispatched. Having said that, with your solutions more events will fire since the legacy event will have to be dispatched too.


&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - This is similar to implementing the full EventTarget Interface on
</I>&gt;<i> Storage areas.  However, the only event of importance on a Storage
</I>&gt;<i> area is &quot;storage&quot; not &quot;click&quot; or &quot;hover&quot; etc.  Invalid event types
</I>&gt;<i> should probably throw an error or something... or maybe this is more
</I>&gt;<i> in the scope of DOM Events.
</I>
That is still quite a bit of complexity for little benefit.
