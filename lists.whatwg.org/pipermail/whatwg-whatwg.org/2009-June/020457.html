</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Head Usage
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;nostyle&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;url=/errors/stylerequired.html&quot;&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Warning: Styles required for correct rendering&lt;/h2&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/nostyle&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason that &lt;noscript&gt; worked is because (IIRC) it was introduced
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time as &lt;script&gt;.  All browsers that supported &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> also supported &lt;noscript&gt;.  &lt;nostyle&gt; would cause all legacy user
</I>&gt;<i> agents to render the content even if they supported styles just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes in the absence of our time machine it seems a bit late doesn't it.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And yes while that is true and for many situations will work fine, there
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other cases you won't and you can get a sloppy or even bad results
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of rendering engine paths.  For example, because style is not applied
</I>&gt;<i> until
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; later you have an issue here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &lt;h2 class=&quot;nostyle&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;error.gif&quot;&gt;Warning: Styles required for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct rendering&lt;/h2&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The network request happens regardless of situation no assuming images
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't seem like a very serious issue.  Just don't use images if
</I>&gt;<i> you care that much.  A large percentage of non-CSS browsers are
</I>&gt;<i> probably text-based anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It isn't but hints at what the motivation was from a real world request (see
below)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, using the content property can be somewhat troubling if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; style is removed.  For example, consider what happens if you are putting
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field required indicators
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; input[type=text].required:before {content: &quot; (*) &quot;}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This should just use HTML5's required attribute instead of a class:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-required-attribute">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-required-attribute</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed that is the case, this is more documenting the usage of designers
</I>not that there isn't an HTML 5  appropriate solution.

Conformant browsers should make it clear to the user that the field is
&gt;<i> required even if styles are disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes they should.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or for offsite links
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a[href^=&quot;<A HREF="http://&quot;]:after">http://&quot;]:after</A> {content:' ( Offsite Link )';}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is non-essential info, and every browser I've heard of exposes it
</I>&gt;<i> anyway (e.g., by hovering over the link and looking in the lower
</I>&gt;<i> left).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or any other dynamic insert this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any other examples where this is a significant issue?
</I>&gt;<i> Those two don't seem like a big deal to me, honestly, even if it were
</I>&gt;<i> logistically possible to get &lt;nostyle&gt; supported widely enough to be
</I>&gt;<i> useful.
</I>

Those were just examples of more valid uses of content actually.  Of course
as I mentioned below people can abuse this property and then it does become
a big deal.  But dynamically having content jam in all sorts of stuff
client-side seems wrong-headed so I certainly don't suggest codifying bad
practices though mitigating them somehow seems appropriate.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If CSS is necessary for a site to operate, it's probably being
</I>&gt;<i> misused.  If an author is misusing CSS this badly, it's not clear to
</I>&gt;<i> me why they could be expected to reliably use &lt;nostyle&gt;.  The contents
</I>&gt;<i> of &lt;nostyle&gt; also don't make a difference to almost anyone, so authors
</I>&gt;<i> who use it won't really understand the purpose it serves and it will
</I>&gt;<i> probably be misused more often than used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You may be quite right.  Understand my purpose of proposing this was mostly
due to some contrivances to determine style and no-style support for an
effort which is very contingency concerned.  The solution that was adopted
using scripting, server-side logging particularly triggered by image
requests from background-image values or their absence, etc. can figure all
cases but it was a mess and thus the &quot;why not have a &lt;nostyle&gt; wouldn't life
be easier&quot;  So from where you sit yes it is not that important likely, from
having to wrestle with it I would have loved to have an easy solution.

Anyway I will say that there is a
bit of symmetry of having on/off cases for all the various client-side
technologies
(img, script, object,
etc.), but I see that the off aspect of style could simply be thought
of as the markup itself and that is
certainly fine it has worked for most so far.
