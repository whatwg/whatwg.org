<PRE>One thing about postMessage that I'm curious about. Since it has to report
failure synchronously by throwing an INVALID_STATE_ERR, that seems to imply
that all data must be written to a socket before returning and cannot be
asynchronously delivered to an I/O thread without adding some risk of
silently dropping
messages. Seems like the right choice would be to allow outbound
messages to drop, which would mean that developers would be forced to
do their own handshaking.
I'm also not sure there is good coverage of error conditions in the spec.
The only methods of error notification are exceptions in postMessage and
onclose. I had assumed that a WebSocket that fails to connect would invoke
onclose asynchronously, but I didn't see that in the spec. Without that you
don't even have the ability to know if a socket failed to establish a
connection (short of readyState polling). The spec also doesn't indicate
that the readyState should transition to CLOSED on connection failure.
(Description of the disconnect() method is careful to mention that it closes
a connection or a connection attempt, but description of when onclose is
fired just mentions a connection closing). I definitely think there should
be a way to receive an event if a connection fails to establish; I would
hate to have to poll another readyState.
