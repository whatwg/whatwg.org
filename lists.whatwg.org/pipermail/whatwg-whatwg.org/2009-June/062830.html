</I>
I've now done this, though I left &quot;complete&quot; as the default view, so that 
people don't come across the spec and miss anything.


&gt;<i> One more thing: although playing with client-side toggles and CSS may be 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting, I think the deliverables should clearly be two different 
</I>&gt;<i> documents, with different names at different URLs.
</I>
The documents are now available at the following URLs:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?style=complete">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?style=complete</A>
   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?style=author">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?style=author</A>
   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?style=highlight">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?style=highlight</A>

(Note that this either requires JavaScript or a user agent that is 
hard-coded to hide or highlight the elements with the class &quot;impl&quot; as 
appropriate.)

In addition, there are radio buttons to change this dynamically (they set 
a cookie to remember the value, which is overridden by the values in the 
URL, so if you want it to remember the value, don't use one of the URLs 
above). You can also change the value dynamically without JS, if you don't 
have JS or have it disabled, by using your browser's alternative style 
sheet switcher UI. (That's all the JS is doing behind the scenes.)

If anyone can write a tool that uses html5lib to parse a document, then 
filters the resulting DOM to remove any nodes that match a particular 
filter (in this case, &quot;has a class with the value 'impl'&quot;), and finally 
outputs HTML again, I can add it to the pipeline to make a static copy of 
the &quot;author-only&quot; page too, if people want that.

Done.


&gt;<i> &gt; You can even have them at the same URL, with a pair of radio buttons

</I>
I don't think alternative style sheets are evil; in fact, they seem to be 
quite within the architecture of the Web. Surely you don't think that, 
e.g., GMail is evil for having the same URL for whether your contact list 
is hidden or expanded.
