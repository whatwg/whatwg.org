</I>&gt;<i> I thought the original idea was backwards compatible. Maybe not the

</I>&gt;<i> issues?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
a) Solved by Validation - I can't think of anything much better then  
that. =(
b) Canonical Listing - This shouldn't be too difficult to distribute  
from a central source or some convention.
c) Hehe, I think I detect a hint of sarcasm.  If there is a SHA1  
collision then you'd probably make a lot of money!


&gt;<i>  Dion: You then also get into the &quot;how do I get my library into the  
</I>&gt;<i> browser?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enough widespread usage of a library is a clear indicator for  
</I>&gt;<i> adoption into a browser bundle.  Dynamically growing repositories  
</I>&gt;<i> could optimize per computer for the particular user's browsing  
</I>&gt;<i> habits (assuming developers would mark their scripts with the  
</I>&gt;<i> identifiers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can have the same problem with what libraries will Google  
</I>&gt;<i> include in its CDN.  Although it may be easier for Google to host  
</I>&gt;<i> just about any library if it already has a CDN setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was a real problem for us. How much is &quot;enough&quot; ? We started to  
</I>&gt;<i> get inundated with requests for people to put libraries up there.
</I>
Lets the browsers decide.  And I can't make any reasonable suggestions  
without getting real world data, something I haven't tried to do yet.   
But yes, this is a good point, something that is extremely flexible /  
variable.


&gt;<i>  Dion: After mulling this over with the Google CDN work, I think  
</I>&gt;<i> that using HTTP and the browser mechanisms that we have now gives us  
</I>&gt;<i> a lot without any of these issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was afraid of this.  This is a completely valid point.  I guess it  
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like too much work for too little gain?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to stop you from working on these ideas. The core  
</I>&gt;<i> problem that we tend to download the same crap all the time is real,  
</I>&gt;<i> and I look forward to seeing people come up with interesting  
</I>&gt;<i> solutions.
</I>
Thanks for the support.  My thoughts are beginning to look like this:
- Javascript Frameworks are downloaded all the time on many domains.  
This is a special case.
- Those who benefit the most are the ones that can't space the extra  
request or large caches.  This makes me think mobile browsers would  
get the biggest benefit.
- I think the iPhone had some special html syntax for its mobile  
webpages, maybe they can sneak this in if it proves useful to them.

- Joe
