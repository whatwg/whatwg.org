</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The actual standardized format is PKCS #10, in form a more advanced

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's an interesting idea.  But PKCS#10 is like a self-signed 
</I>&gt;<i> certificate. It has a full-blown X.500 Directory Name in it, just like a 
</I>&gt;<i> certificate, and the KEYGEN tag doesn't provide the input for that.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess the browser could prompt the user, perhaps using a form something 
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/main.html">http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/main.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But heaven help the user to fill that in! :-/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also like a real certificate, a PKCS#10 certificate request may have 
</I>&gt;<i> extensions.  This is the way that a cert requester requests that 
</I>&gt;<i> particular extensions be put into his cert.  Again, the keygen tag has 
</I>&gt;<i> no way of specifying these.  But the browser could use a form like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/stnd_ext_form.html">http://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/cmd/certcgi/stnd_ext_form.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's one other problem with PKCS#10 (and SPKAC too) that I mentioned 
</I>&gt;<i> before: it only works with public keys that can be used for signing. If 
</I>&gt;<i> you have an &quot;encryption only&quot; key, you can't request a cert for it with 
</I>&gt;<i> PKCS#10 because doing so requires generating a signature with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To solve these and other problems, an alternative protocol named CRMF 
</I>&gt;<i> (the &quot;Certificate Request Message Format&quot;) was created.  Mozilla 
</I>&gt;<i> supports that with the crypto.generateCRMFRequest method.  If we're 
</I>&gt;<i> really going to standardize something like a keygen tag, we should 
</I>&gt;<i> design it to be able to do the things that can be done with 
</I>&gt;<i> crypto.generateCRMFRequest, too. That should not be difficult.  See
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/JavaScript_crypto/GenerateCRMFRequest">https://developer.mozilla.org/En/JavaScript_crypto/GenerateCRMFRequest</A>
</I>
I agree that standardising this would be a good idea; I recommend 
approaching the public-webapps WG at the W3C to do this.


&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't added this, because right now the only browser I could find 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which supports more than one algorithm is Firefox, and it just has two 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (RSA and ECs, as far as I could tell).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And DSA.
</I>
The DSA code doesn't appear to be hooked up.


&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't added ECs to HTML5 since I couldn't find any documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on it (the above isn't updated yet). Also, I omitted DSA support which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is claimed to be supported on the above page, because as far as I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tell nobody actually supports it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not popular in the commercial world, but I think a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> government still likes it. :)
</I>
I'm definitely not adding features to HTML5 for a single vendor, even if 
that vendor has an army.


&gt;<i> Which is more likely to be adopted as a cross browser standard? A new 
</I>&gt;<i> html tag? or a new JavaScript object/method?
</I>
It would presumably depend on how it is to be used. If it's for form 
submission, then an element would make more sense. If it's for 
applications, then an API would be better.

Thanks for the info!

Even if IE's market share stops dropping (which it shows no signs of 
doing), I believe that getting interop amongst three browser vendors is an 
important enough goal that it is still worth standardising even if 
Microsoft never implement &lt;keygen&gt;.
