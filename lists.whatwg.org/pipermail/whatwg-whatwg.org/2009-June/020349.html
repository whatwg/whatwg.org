The behaviour of these things are defined in WebIDL:

   <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/">http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/</A>

...which, as defined today, consists of setting 'removeItem' to a function 
value that doesn't persist.


&gt;<i> Safari shows 2 alerts, and the second one says 'function'.

This appears to be correct according to WebIDL today.

Right.

They are serialised to disk if you ever call the actual setter with those 
names; it's just that in this case you never call that setter.


&gt;<i> That said, IE8 doesn't support the delete operator in this fashion and 
</I>&gt;<i> .clear() does not reset functions in Safari 4 (beta).
</I>
.clear() indeed would not affect the functions.

It seems clear to me.

The special setters aren't invoked in this particular case according to 
WebIDL.

Implementors need to make sure they read WedIDL. :-)

They only persist if the custom setter is invoked.
