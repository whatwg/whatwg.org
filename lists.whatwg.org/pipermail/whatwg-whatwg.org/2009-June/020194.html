We can't require this. Imagine a user agent that is a jumbotron in Times 
Square, controlled by just a big scrollwheel and huge button in the middle 
of the road, and big speakers.

Why should such a user agent be required to provide a &quot;mute&quot; UI?

</I>&gt;<i> noise.
</I>
I agree that it would be good practice to have such an interface, but 
that's something for users to take up with their vendors, it's not 
something that the spec should get involved in.


&gt;<i> (There is a precedent for worrying about &quot;mere annoyance&quot;: &quot;User agents 
</I>&gt;<i> should not provide a public API to cause videos to be shown full-screen. 
</I>&gt;<i> A script, combined with a carefully crafted video file, could trick the

</I>&gt;<i> user for a password. There is also the danger of &quot;mere&quot; annoyance, with 
</I>&gt;<i> pages launching full-screen videos when links are clicked or pages 
</I>&gt;<i> navigated.&quot;)
</I>
This is more about security than &quot;mere annoyance&quot;. The latter is just an 
afterthought here.


&gt;<i> Should autoplay be removed as an attribute of audio and video, precisely 
</I>&gt;<i> to remove such annoyance from people who rely on aural browsing?
</I>
On the contrary, having this be a declarative attribute makes it easier to 
disable. If we remove the attribute, authors will do it in JS and we'll be 
powerless to remove it. Ironically, the attribute is present precisely 
because it can be annoying.

The world in which the spec has any control over what browsers implement 
is far more Utopia than the world in which browser vendors respond to 
their users' needs, believe me. :-)
