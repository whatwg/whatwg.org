</I>
The definition in HTML5 is just a description of how it's used in 
practice. It's not what I'd design if I had a choice. However, there's not 
much point defining something that doesn't match the reality of the 
situation.


&gt;<i> For example, in HTML5, how do you express 20 items on a page, each with 
</I>&gt;<i> separate licenses? How do you differentiate a page that has 3 primary 
</I>&gt;<i> topics, each with a separate license?
</I>
You can't, currently. Can you provide a sample of such a page?


&gt;<i> In short - what's the purpose of rel=&quot;license&quot; if a machine can't use it 
</I>&gt;<i> to help the person browsing identify important sections of a page?
</I>
rel=license as it stands today is useful only (as far as I can tell) for 
people searching the Web for pages whose main content (e.g. the photo on a 
Flickr page, the text of a blog post on a blog post's permalink, etc) is 
licensed under a particular license identified by URI.


&gt;<i> Afterall, it's only machine readable, isn't it? What's the sense in 
</I>&gt;<i> having rel=&quot;license&quot; if a machine can't be sure of the section of the 
</I>&gt;<i> page to which it applies?
</I>
Generally speaking, search engines are pretty competent at distinguishing 
the page's main content from ancillary content such as style sheets or 
navigation links.


&gt;<i> More importantly, if you see this as an issue, why don't you see the 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic difference between rel=&quot;alternate&quot;[3] in HTML4 and 
</I>&gt;<i> rel=&quot;alternate&quot;[4] in HTML5 as being an issue? That case is even worse, 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same string - entirely different semantics.
</I>
HTML5's definition, again, matches what actual implementations and author 
usage is. HTML5 isn't trying to be compatible with HTML4, it's trying to 
be compatible with legacy content.


&gt;<i> &gt; You would have to ask them. I tend not to argue with implementor 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feedback. If they tell me they won't do something, I don't tell them 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would expect the primary editor for a web specification to understand 
</I>&gt;<i> the reason that every single one of their implementors refuse to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement a technique that they use elsewhere in their products.
</I>
I believe I do, but I wouldn't want to put words in their mouth on such 
controversial topics.


&gt;<i> I'd love to ask eacho of them why it is perceived as difficult and 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss possible solutions. A public e-mail would be best so that we can 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss on this list, but a private e-mail would be fine as well. So 
</I>&gt;<i> please, if your organization has decided to not resolve prefixes in 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute values, please send me an e-mail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After two weeks, I'll check back in with the mailing list to report on 
</I>&gt;<i> the number of responses I received and a summary of the reasoning 
</I>&gt;<i> (anonymized, of course) for the benefit of this community.
</I>
Did you receive any responses?
