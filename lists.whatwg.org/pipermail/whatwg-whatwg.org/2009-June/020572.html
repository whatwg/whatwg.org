<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> This doesn't break anything in the current spec.  So it wouldn't  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any existing implementations.  I'm also guessing that the groundwork
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for implementing a feature like this is already in place due to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ubiquity of addEventListener.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be frank, it seems like a lot of bloat though to avoid a simple  
</I>&gt;<i> comparison.
</I>
Its my thinking that the simple comparison shouldn't be necessary to  
begin with.  Thats why I suggested this.

This is a probably a bad analogy, but would it make sense to put a  
&quot;click&quot; function on just the window object and check every time it  
fires to see if it fired in the &lt;div&gt; you were interested in?  Imagine  
every single &quot;click&quot; listener you register fires every time you click  
on something... that doesn't scale.  (The reason this is a bad is  
because these &quot;click&quot; events &quot;bubble&quot;.  Maybe bubbling is appropriate  
here)?


&gt;&gt;<i> - Less Listener Functions Fired - Instead of every registered  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listener
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting fired on every &quot;storage&quot; event, only those applicable will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fired.  This may mean overall less listeners getting fired, and code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that doesn't have to continually check the affected storageArea,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leading to potential performance improvements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, assuming only one of the two solutions would exist the  
</I>&gt;<i> same amount of events would fire. A change to localStorage causes an  
</I>&gt;<i> event to be dispatched and likewise a change to sessionStorage  
</I>&gt;<i> causes an event to be dispatched. Having said that, with your  
</I>&gt;<i> solutions more events will fire since the legacy event will have to  
</I>&gt;<i> be dispatched too.
</I>
What do you mean when you say &quot;more events will fire?&quot;  Why not just  
fire the same &quot;storage&quot; event but now put the if statement that the  
web developer had to &quot;always write&quot; and put it into the browser's  
dispatching code.  This may be my inexperience with the  
implementations, but I honestly don't see how this could end up firing  
more events.

I think looking at it this way (&quot;more events&quot;) is looking at it  
sideways and maybe a bit pessimistically.  If my first thought is  
&quot;this is going to be really complex&quot; then my next thought is &quot;how can  
I simplify this&quot; and if I can't find a way to simplify it I would  
state why it can't or shouldn't be done.  I don't see that here, I  
just see the &quot;this is really complex&quot; part.  I'm guessing that there  
is a simpler way to look at this, and if not I'd be interested to know  
why this seems so complex.
