</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is the solution that Firefox 3.5 uses. We use a pool of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; relatively few OS threads (5 or so iirc). This pool is then scheduled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to run worker tasks as they are scheduled. So for example if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; create 1000 worker objects, those 5 threads will take turns to execute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the initial scripts one at a time. If you then send a message using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; postMessage to 500 of those workers, and the other 500 calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; setTimeout in their initial script, the same threads will take turns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to run those 1000 tasks (500 message events, and 500 timer callbacks).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is somewhat simplified, and things are a little more complicated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; due to how we handle synchronous network loads (during which we freeze
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and OS thread and remove it from the pool), but the above is the basic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; idea.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; / Jonas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thats a really good model. Scalable and degrades nicely. The only problem
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with very long running operations where a worker script doesn't return in
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; timely fashion. If enough of them do that, all others starve. What does
</I>&gt;<i> FF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do about that, or in practice do you anticipate that not being an issue?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Webkit dedicates an OS thread per worker. Chrome goes even further (for
</I>&gt;<i> now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least) with a process per worker. The 1:1 mapping is probably overkill
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most workers will probably spend most of their life asleep just waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do see it as a problem, but not big enough of a problem that we
</I>&gt;<i> needed to solve it in the initial version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not really a problem for most types of calculations, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> the number of threads is larger than the number of cores we'll still
</I>&gt;<i> finish all tasks as quickly as the CPU is able to. Even for long
</I>&gt;<i> running operations, if it's operations that the user wants anyway, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't really matter if the jobs are running all in parallel, or
</I>&gt;<i> staggered after each other. As long as you're keeping all CPU cores
</I>&gt;<i> busy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some scenarios which it doesn't work so well for. For
</I>&gt;<i> example a worker that works more or less infinitely and produces more
</I>&gt;<i> and more accurate results the longer it runs. Or something like a
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">folding at home</A> website which performs calculations as long as the user
</I>&gt;<i> is on a website and submits them to the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If enough of those workers are scheduled it will block everything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is all solveable of course, there's a lot of tweaking we can do.
</I>&gt;<i> But we figured we wanted to get some data on how people use workers
</I>&gt;<i> before spending too much time developing a perfect scheduling
</I>&gt;<i> solution.
</I>

I never did like the Gears model (1:1 mapping with a thread). We were stuck
with a strong thread affinity due to other constraints (script engines,
COM/XPCOM).
But we could have allowed multiple workers to reside in a single thread.
A thread pool (perhaps per origin) sort of arrangement, where once a worker
was put on a particular thread it stayed there until end-of-life.

Your FF model has more flexibility. Give a worker a slice
(well where slice == run-to-completion) on any thread in the
pool, no thread affinity whatsoever (if i understand correctly).
