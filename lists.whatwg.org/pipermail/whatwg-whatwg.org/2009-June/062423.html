</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe it should be invoked if there are no other pages open that have the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This has the advantage of not depending on JavaScript, and not affecting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the browser's performance (no waiting for sync XHR, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would work somewhat like PING does today, though probably using POST.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As an author, I'd definitely use it.  I'd want the second option (ping 
</I>&gt;<i> when you close the last window with a given logout attribute), as that 
</I>&gt;<i> would allow me to define 'domains' within the same origin that track 
</I>&gt;<i> logins separately.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be easy to code against the lack of this (just do an occasional 
</I>&gt;<i> cleanup of sessions that have aged too much, which you'd have to do 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway in case of nonstandard browser exits), but would allow better, 
</I>&gt;<i> more reliable security for users with browsers that implement it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to handle this through javascript onunload is nontrivial 
</I>&gt;<i> currently, but @logout would make it both trivial and dependable.

</I>&gt;<i> This is really about making the whole logout process more friendly for

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The user agent would do a GET request of /logout when it no longer had

</I>&gt;<i> specialtoken value. specialtoken (or whaever you'd like to call it) 
</I>&gt;<i> could be optional and in that case the user agent could rely on origin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way, the server would not need to count the number of loaded 
</I>&gt;<i> documents.

I like Philipp's idea of making this a new &quot;rel&quot; value. I encourage people 
who are interested in this idea to add it to the WHATWG RelExtensions 
wiki, write a spec for it (you can put it on a page on that wiki if you 
like) and then see if browser vendors are interested in supporting this 
feature.
