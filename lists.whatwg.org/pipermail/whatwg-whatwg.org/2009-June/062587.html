What about the case where you have a JS-based viewer, and so when the
user clicks a photo, they do not go to a separate page, but instead
get a pop-up viewer?

Surely that's common, and it's entirely feasible that different photos
on the page would have different licenses.

Or another case: a weblog that includes third-party photo content
(could be your own photos too). You want to label your blog text with
one license, and the linked photos with another.
