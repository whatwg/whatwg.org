</I>&gt;<i> essentially different uses for &lt;video&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Important content for the webpage.  An example would be the central 
</I>&gt;<i> video on a web page whose purpose is to allow users to view that video. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is currently done principally using Adobe Flash and (to a lesser 
</I>&gt;<i> extent) &lt;object&gt; tags.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Incidental animations.  Examples include decorative elements in a web 
</I>&gt;<i> page's interface, animated sidebar advertisements, and other small page 
</I>&gt;<i> elements of this kind.  This was historically a popular use for 
</I>&gt;<i> animated-GIF, though Flash has largely overtaken it here as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In case 1, a browser on a low-powered device may show the video 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;full-screen or in an independent resizable window&quot; (to quote the spec). 
</I>&gt;<i> The browser might also show the video at the specified size, but on top 
</I>&gt;<i> of the page, rather than at its &quot;correct&quot; location in the middle of the 
</I>&gt;<i> rendering stack.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, for case 2, showing the video full-screen or moving it to the 
</I>&gt;<i> top of the rendering stack would clearly be a bad idea, as the video 
</I>&gt;<i> does not contain the content of interest to the user.  In this case, if 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers cannot display the video as specified, they should probably 
</I>&gt;<i> fall back to the &quot;poster&quot; image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the current tag definition, browsers will have to grow ugly 
</I>&gt;<i> heuristics for this case, based on video's size, aspect ratio, &quot;loop&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;controls&quot;.  To avoid this heuristic hack, I suggest that &lt;video&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> gain an additional attribute to indicate which behavior is preferable.  
</I>&gt;<i> A boolean attribute like &quot;decorative&quot;, &quot;incidental&quot;, or &quot;significant&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> would greatly assist browsers in determining the correct behavior.

I wouldn't expect the user agent to automatically switch to fullscreen 
playback immediately. I would expect the user agent to require the user to 
invoke full-screen mode manually.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the risk of authors accidentally setting &quot;decorative&quot; on

</I>&gt;<i> Isn't that like saying that authors who are only testing on normal

</I>&gt;<i> often than they get it right.  In the ~0.1% of images where longdesc= is 
</I>&gt;<i> used, it's misused literally over 99% of the time:

</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://blog.whatwg.org/the-longdesc-lottery">http://blog.whatwg.org/the-longdesc-lottery</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It thus ends up being so useless for users that even if you do provide a 
</I>&gt;<i> good longdesc, no one will actually use it.  There's so little signal 
</I>&gt;<i> and so much noise that screenreader users just don't bother checking it, 
</I>&gt;<i> if they even know that it exists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It thus seems like it would be prudent to wait on implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> experience to see if a new attribute is actually needed here.  Adding 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes that don't affect most users is a recipe for widespread 
</I>&gt;<i> misuse.  In the worst case, browsers might very well refuse to support 
</I>&gt;<i> the attribute because it's come into wide misuse before any browser 
</I>&gt;<i> actually supports it, so supporting it breaks sites.  (I'm pretty sure 
</I>&gt;<i> there are examples of this happening, although I can't think of any 
</I>&gt;<i> offhand.)

I concurr with Simon and Aryeh here.

You don't have to show it for each one. You can just have each video that 
the script has triggered provide an affordance (such as a glowing &quot;play&quot; 
button) that triggers the fullscreen mode.


Authors who actually care about this situation (and thus would correctly 
use the proposed attribute) can already use media queries to avoid this 
problem in the first place.
