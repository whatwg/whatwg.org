It all depends on the intent of the feature.

Some browsers have features intended to shield the identity of the  
person doing browsing from the site. Similarly the browser would not  
want the site to be able to detect that this was an anonymous browsing  
session.

Safari has long had a feature, Private Browsing, intended to allow  
browsing without leaving record on the computer that the browsing took  
place. That feature makes no attempt to mislead the websites about who  
is doing the browsing and does not try to &#8220;anonymize&#8221; the browsing.  
And the code in WebKit we are discussing was originally created to  
implement part of this Safari feature.
