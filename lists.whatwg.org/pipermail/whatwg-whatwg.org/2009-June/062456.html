</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>
I agree that this is more of a UI issue. The API exposes the entire clip.

The spec says that the UA has to seek to the indicated time, but it 
doesn't preclude anything else, certainly.

</I>&gt;<i> I think there are two use cases:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Wanting to start the user at a particular point in a video, while 
</I>&gt;<i> still showing the user that the full video is there. For example in a 
</I>&gt;<i> political speech you may want to start off at a particularly interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> part, while still allowing the viewer to &quot;rewind&quot; to any part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> speech in order to gain more context if so desired. This is very similar 
</I>&gt;<i> to how web pages work today if you include a fragment identifier. The UI 
</I>&gt;<i> accounts for the full page, but the page is scrolled to a particular 
</I>&gt;<i> part.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> 2. Wanting to only show a small part of a longer video. For example in 
</I>&gt;<i> the video containing a movie, it would be possible to link to a 
</I>&gt;<i> particular scene, with a given start and end time.
</I>
This can be done by providing a custom (JS) controller for the element, 
though nothing can ever prevent the user from overriding this (at the 
extreme, by just downloading the video and watching it in a separate 
player, but indeed the browser is supposed to allow this anyway).


&gt;<i> The danger of only doing 2, even if it's possible somehow for the user 
</I>&gt;<i> to switch to make the UI display the full range of the movie, is that 
</I>&gt;<i> unless the UI is extremely obvious, most users are not going to see it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or to put it another way. I think there is a use case for both linking 
</I>&gt;<i> to a specific point in a video file, as well to point to a range in it. 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably even a combination of the two where you point to a point inside 
</I>&gt;<i> a range.
</I>
That's possible. I think we should probably wait until the next version of 
the API before introducing an explicit way of limiting the range, though.

</I>
This seems to be an issue for the working group defining these syntaxes; 
the HTML5 spec just says that if &quot;the address of the current media 
resource [indicates] a particular start time&quot; that you seek to it, without 
elaborating.

</I>&gt;<i> bar (by clicking on a random position), the UA may use whatever means

</I>&gt;<i> wg] in order to retrieve that data.
</I>
The HTML5 spec doesn't even guarantee that there is a seek bar, but it 
does suggest that UAs allow the user to seek to any seekable position.

</I>&gt;<i> be 5s.
</I>
This is consistent with the spec's current requirements, I believe, yes.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I think a safer design would be to interpret currentTime as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relative to the startTime, perhaps renaming startTime to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'timeOffset' instead?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I considered that, but it seems that in the streaming video 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; (&quot;DVR-like&quot;) case, in the steady state where the data in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; buffer is being thrown away at the same rate as the video is being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; played you'd end up in a weird position of the currentTime not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; changing despite the video playing, which would likely be even 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; more confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why should the &quot;start time&quot; change in this case? I assume you mean 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the server is streaming video and does not support sending any data 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; except the data for the current time, and the UA is caching a window 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of data. Then I would expect the element to expose a fixed start 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; time (the time, relative to the start of the resource, at which the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; UA first opened the stream). As the stream plays, 'duration' would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; increase and the 'seekable' and 'buffered' TimeRanges would change 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to reflect the data the UA has in its buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mean, e.g., a TiVo-like interface, where the input is a TV tuner, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a streaming video service that doesn't let you seek but where the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is buffering 15 minutes of content so that the user can seek within 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that. The way this is supported in the spec now, the start time (the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;earliest possible position&quot;) continually changes, so that the UI 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't show an increasingly long time frame, but instead only shows 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the last 30 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To me, &quot;the earliest possible position&quot; seems redundant with the 'seekable'
</I>&gt;<i> TimeRanges.
</I>
Yes, generally speaking .startTime is a convenient way to obtain 
.seekable.start(0). The exception is that if the content is not seekable 
at all, the .startTime attribute will still return a value (either the 
same as currentTime, if the UA is playing live video without buffering at 
all, or zero, if it's just that the codec doesn't support seeking) whereas 
the .seekable attribute in those cases would return an empty object.


&gt;<i> I think your use-case can be exposed perfectly adequately with an 
</I>&gt;<i> indefinite 'duration' and 'seekable' and 'buffered' TimeRanges changing 
</I>&gt;<i> over time (which will happen in many non-streaming cases too).
</I>
I don't understand the difference between what you're proposing here and 
what the spec says, except that the spec exposes the first start point of 
the seekable object as .startTime.


&gt;<i> There is no need to have 'startTime' changing; that seems an unnecessary 
</I>&gt;<i> complication. I think that dynamically changing the &quot;time coordinate 
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; in which 'currentTime' is interpreted is a bad idea.
</I>
If the user agent is dynamically throwing out data continually, keeping 
only a small amount of data buffered, as for example the BitGravity player 
as seen here:

   <A HREF="http://live.twit.tv/">http://live.twit.tv/</A>

...I don't see what else we can do but change the seekable range (and thus 
the startTime). The original start time is not of much interest (it's an 
arbitrary time -- when the user started watching) and the current playback 
time is definitely advancing.
