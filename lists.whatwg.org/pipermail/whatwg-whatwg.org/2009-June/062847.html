The spec still hasn't diverged. Hopefully it never will. If it does, I 
guess we cross that bridge when we get to it.


&gt;<i> There are a lot of people, including some W3C working group members, who 
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer a HTML 5 specification that is more limited in scope than 
</I>&gt;<i> the current WHATWG specification.
</I>
I would encourange anyone interested in such an effort to persue it. So 
far nobody has stepped up to the plate to actually do that work though. 
Personally I don't think a less ambitious project is as interesting.


&gt;<i> The time to produce a final HTML 5 recommendation could be significantly 
</I>&gt;<i> reduced simply by dropping features from the specification that have 
</I>&gt;<i> little to do with HTML. For example, the data storage and networking 
</I>&gt;<i> APIs should be moved from the HTML 5 specification into their own 
</I>&gt;<i> specification(s)
</I>
This has been done, though not for the reasons you mention. I actually 
don't think it'll make any difference to the timetable; the specs are all 
still following the same timetable as was originally planned for HTML5 as 
a whole.


&gt;<i> and the syntax error handling requirements should be removed in the W3C 
</I>&gt;<i> version.
</I>
Making the W3C and WHATWG specs diverge seems undesireable.


&gt;<i> The bias against the XML serialization should also be removed.
</I>
I believe the spec is more or less neutral on this now.


&gt;<i> The WHATWG seems determined to &quot;stay the course&quot; on these issues, but 
</I>&gt;<i> there is (more) opposition within the W3C WG. So, some kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> significant divergence seems likely.
</I>
Let's hope we can manage to avoid any divergence. It hasn't been necessary 
yet, at least.
