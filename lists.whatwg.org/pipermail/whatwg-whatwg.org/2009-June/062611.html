Done.

Just do a redirect like Jonas describes, instead of returning the page 
contents directly. You can even redirect to the same URL.

</I>
I'm sure people are open to suggestions. I wouldn't worry about whether 
they're in scope for HTML5 or not; if they're not, we can always redirect 
you to the right group.

</I>&gt;<i> Firefox, at least) will risk presenting the annoying &quot;Do you want to

</I>&gt;<i> you know what X and Y are in the new request?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One workaround is to just stick the info in the query string of the GET.  
</I>&gt;<i> One problem with this is that it makes it easy to trick users into 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking they've just done something alarming: you can link to 
</I>&gt;<i> confirmmove.php?page1=Main_Page&amp;page2=Main_Page_ON_WHEELS, and the user 
</I>&gt;<i> will think they actually just moved the page (the software told them 
</I>&gt;<i> so!).  Another problem is that sometimes there's way too much data to 
</I>&gt;<i> fit into a query string.  For instance, in MediaWiki you can move a page 
</I>&gt;<i> with all its subpages.  There might be hundreds or even thousands of 
</I>&gt;<i> these, and a success/failure message is printed for each, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> reason for failure if appropriate.  This might be too long to fit in a 
</I>&gt;<i> GET.
</I>
Just stick the data into the query parameters, including the user's ID, 
then sign the query parameters, and when serving the page, check the 
signature and check the user's ID matches the cookie.


&gt;<i> A similar workaround would be to use cookies.  This is nicer than the 
</I>&gt;<i> previous method, but has the potential to break confusingly if the user 
</I>&gt;<i> takes several similar actions at once (e.g., moving a number of pages at 
</I>&gt;<i> once in multiple tabs).
</I>
Using sessionStorage can be used to work around this somewhat, at least 
in AJAX apps.

This would be something for the HTTP spec, I believe. HTML5 just mentions 
asking for reloads when the method is not idempotent.
