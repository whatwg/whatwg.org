<PRE>Also sprach Daniel Berlin:

 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Library.&quot;

 &gt; Note that the actual *clause* (not the example) in question says
 &gt; &quot;If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
 &gt; obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
 &gt; then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. &quot;
 &gt; It then gives the patent example as an example of when you could not
 &gt; fulfill your obligations under the license.  The restrictive license
 &gt; in the example falls afoul of this condition (part of #10): &quot;You may
 &gt; not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
 &gt; rights granted herein.&quot;  Nothing in any licenses we have with other
 &gt; parties imposes any *further restrictions* on the recipients who get
 &gt; ffmpeg from us.  You get *exactly* the same set of rights and
 &gt; obligations we got from ffmpeg.
 &gt; As such, we can simultaneously satisfy our obligations under this
 &gt; license (which again does not require us to pass along patent rights
 &gt; we may have obtained elsewhere, it only requires we grant you the
 &gt; rights you find in terms 0-16 and place no further restrictions on
 &gt; you) and any patent licenses we may have, and do not run afoul of this
 &gt; clause.

I get parsing errors in my brain when reading this. While I understand
that you do not impose any new restrictions (as per #10), I still
don't understand how you can claim that #11 (the first two quotes
above) has no relevance in your case. To me, it seems that the example
in #11 (the first quote) matches this case exactly -- assuming that
Google has a patent license that does not permit royalty-free
redistribution.

I also understand that the LGPL doesn't explicitly &quot;require [anyone]
to pass along patent rights we may have obtained elsewhere&quot;. However,
it seems quite clear that the intention of #11 is to say that you
cannot redistribute the code unless you do exactly that.

What am I missing?
