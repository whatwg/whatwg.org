We do see it as a problem, but not big enough of a problem that we
needed to solve it in the initial version.

It's not really a problem for most types of calculations, as long as
the number of threads is larger than the number of cores we'll still
finish all tasks as quickly as the CPU is able to. Even for long
running operations, if it's operations that the user wants anyway, it
doesn't really matter if the jobs are running all in parallel, or
staggered after each other. As long as you're keeping all CPU cores
busy.

There are some scenarios which it doesn't work so well for. For
example a worker that works more or less infinitely and produces more
and more accurate results the longer it runs. Or something like a
<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">folding at home</A> website which performs calculations as long as the user
is on a website and submits them to the server.

If enough of those workers are scheduled it will block everything else.

This is all solveable of course, there's a lot of tweaking we can do.
But we figured we wanted to get some data on how people use workers
before spending too much time developing a perfect scheduling
solution.
