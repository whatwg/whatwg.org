<PRE>I believe that this will be difficult to have such a limit as sites  
may rely on GC to collect Workers that are no longer running (so  
number of running threads is non-deterministic), and in the context of  
mix source content (&quot;mash-ups&quot;) it will be difficult for any content  
source to be sure it isn't going to contribute to that limit.   
Obviously a UA shouldn't crash, but i believe that it is up to the UA  
to determine how to achieve this -- eg. having a limit to allow a 1:1  
relationship between workers and processes will have a much lower  
limit than an implementation that has a worker per thread model, or an  
m:n relationship between workers and threads/processes.  Having the  
specification limited simply because one implementation mechanism has  
certain limits when there are many alternative implementation models  
seems like a bad idea.

I believe if there's going to be any worker related limits, it should  
realistically be a lower limit on the number of workers rather than an  
upper.

</I>&gt;<i> We think about how to reasonably place limits on the resources

</I>&gt;<i> maxumum number of parallel workers available to page or domain or  
</I>&gt;<i> browser. But what do you do when a limit is reached? The Worker()  
</I>&gt;<i> constructor could return null or throw exception. However, that  
</I>&gt;<i> seems to go against the spirit of the spec since it usually does not  
</I>&gt;<i> deal with resource constraints. So it makes sense to look for the  
</I>&gt;<i> most sensible implementation that tries best to behave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current idea is to let create as many Worker objects as requested,  
</I>&gt;<i> but not necessarily start them right away. So the resources are not  
</I>&gt;<i> allocated except the thin JS wrapper. As long as workers terminate  
</I>&gt;<i> and the number of them decreases below the limit, more workers from  
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;ready queue&quot; could be started. This allows to support  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation limits w/o exposing them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is similar to how a 'sea of XHRs' would behave. The test page  
</I>&gt;<i> here creates 10,000 async XHR requests to distinct URLs and then  
</I>&gt;<i> waits for all of them to complete. While it's obviosuly impossible  
</I>&gt;<i> to have 10K http connections in parallel, all XHRs will be  
</I>&gt;<i> completed, given time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does it sound like a good way to avoid the resource crunch due to  
</I>&gt;<i> high number of workers?
