</I>&gt;<i> Can you please tell me if, when I receive Chrome from you, I also

</I>Yes, you do.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe I know the answer, based on your statement &quot;No more or less
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230; than &#8230; ffmpeg&quot; as ffmpeg explicitly does not provide any patent
</I>&gt;<i> licensing,
</I>:<i>)
</I>Again, that was specifically about ffmpeg as a component of Google
Chrome, not about Google Chrome as a whole.   Licensing of projects
that use a lot of open source components with a lot of different
licenses is a complicated matter, since each component can have a
license that is separate than the license for the work as a whole.
I'm trying to make sure I am being as explicit as I can about what
each subject i am talking about is while still providing answers, so
that the answers are the actual answer, but as you can imagine, it's
tricky.  It can be hard to differentiate between the questions people
want to know an answer that is more general than what they asked, and
those where they want to know just about that specific thing.  When it
comes to matters like these, it's usually best for me to just answer
the question people actually asked explicitly, and let them ask
followups, than it is to try to anticipate what they really wanted to
know.  It can come off as dodging at times, but i'm doing the best i
can ;)
