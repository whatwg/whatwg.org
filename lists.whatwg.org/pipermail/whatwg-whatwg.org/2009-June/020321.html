</I>&gt;<i> But why can't one have &quot;the best of both worlds&quot; without having to go

</I>
Hopefully you have a separate page for each photo *anyway*.  If you
don't - that is, if you only have a thumbnails page, and then a
js-based fullsize viewer - your page is pretty crappy in terms of
accessibility and discoverability.

Given that of course we all value making our pages accessible ^_^, the
problem is already solved.  The js-based viewer is merely a
convenience for those that can use it, and license information can be
embedded on the individual pages.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Surely that's common, and it's entirely feasible that different photos
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on the page would have different licenses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think it's that common for different photos on the page to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have different licenses (and preventing that scenario is just one more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason to fight license proliferation), but even if true it's covered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depends what you mean by &quot;covered&quot;. I'd say the RDFa examples of this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cover&quot; it better in the sense that they don't impose an arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> restriction that the license only applies to a single object (or I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose group of objects).
</I>
The restriction is far from arbitrary - it makes it dead-simple.  Any
solution that allows you to assign different licenses to various
pieces of content on a single page in a machine-readable way is
necessarily more complex.  It's not apparent in these examples that
anything more complex is necessary.

Regardless, though, the situation is *indeed* covered.  The fact that
you can imagine a slightly different solution doesn't change the fact
that existing markup is *a* solution, at least for any halfway decent
site design.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Or another case: a weblog that includes third-party photo content
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (could be your own photos too). You want to label your blog text with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one license, and the linked photos with another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is indeed not covered by @rel=license. &#160;Is it necessary to embed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the separate licensing information for the pictures in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine-readable way? &#160;It seems that just putting a human-readable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> license link on each picture would work pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't really my area, but I could imagine an organization (in
</I>&gt;<i> particular) wanting to include machine-readable license links (a la
</I>&gt;<i> CC).
</I>
Can you illustrate this more plainly?
