It's not true that all the specs tested in Acid3 represented &quot;vendor
consensus&quot;. For example, a lot of browser people were skeptical of the value
of SVG Animation (SMIL), but it was added to Acid3. That was a clear example
of something being implemented primarily because of pressure from
specifications and tests. It's true, though, that no-one flat-out refused to
implement it, so that situation isn't quite the same.

Personally I think it's appropriate to use specs to exert some pressure.
We've always done it. Flat-out refusal of a vendor to implement something is
a problem, but I assume there are limits to how much we allow that to affect
the process. If Microsoft suddenly announces they hate HTML5 and won't
implement any of it, would we just throw it all out?

If we are going to allow individual vendors to exert veto power, at least
lets make them accountable. Let's require them to make public statements
with justifications instead of passing secret notes to Hixie.
