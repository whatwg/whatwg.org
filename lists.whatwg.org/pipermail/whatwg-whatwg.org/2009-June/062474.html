</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Library.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; Note that the actual *clause* (not the example) in question says
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; &quot;If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; It then gives the patent example as an example of when you could not
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; fulfill your obligations under the license. &#160;The restrictive license
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; in the example falls afoul of this condition (part of #10): &quot;You may
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; rights granted herein.&quot; &#160;Nothing in any licenses we have with other
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; parties imposes any *further restrictions* on the recipients who get
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; ffmpeg from us. &#160;You get *exactly* the same set of rights and
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; obligations we got from ffmpeg.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; As such, we can simultaneously satisfy our obligations under this
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; license (which again does not require us to pass along patent rights
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; we may have obtained elsewhere, it only requires we grant you the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; rights you find in terms 0-16 and place no further restrictions on
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; you) and any patent licenses we may have, and do not run afoul of this
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; clause.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get parsing errors in my brain when reading this. While I understand
</I>&gt;<i> that you do not impose any new restrictions (as per #10), I still
</I>&gt;<i> don't understand how you can claim that #11 (the first two quotes
</I>&gt;<i> above) has no relevance in your case. To me, it seems that the example
</I>&gt;<i> in #11 (the first quote) matches this case exactly -- assuming that
</I>&gt;<i> Google has a patent license that does not permit royalty-free
</I>&gt;<i> redistribution.
</I>As i've said in other messages, this example doesn't match this case
at all, since the patent license was not given to us by the same
people who gave us the library, *and* our patent license doesn't even
say anything about the library used to do encoding/decoding. I.E. Our
patent license has 0 to say about our distribution of ffmpeg, only
something to say about our distribution of Chrome, which is only
covered by section 6 of the LGPL 2.1 (which allows distribution under
whatever terms we choose so long as we meet certain requirements,
which we do).

&gt;<i> I also understand that the LGPL doesn't explicitly &quot;require [anyone]
</I>&gt;<i> to pass along patent rights we may have obtained elsewhere&quot;. However,
</I>&gt;<i> it seems quite clear that the intention of #11 is to say that you
</I>&gt;<i> cannot redistribute the code unless you do exactly that.
</I>&gt;<i> What am I missing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That our patent license does not restrict/grant/say anything about
ffmpeg, only Google Chrome, and Google Chrome itself doesn't fall
under the LGPL 2.1 except through section 6.
