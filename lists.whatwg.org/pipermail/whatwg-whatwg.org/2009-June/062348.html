</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not saying that at all. I'm simply saying that any patent license

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I now understand that your statement was only that Google's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution of FFMPEG is not in violation of the LGPL due to patent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> licenses. Thank you for clarifying what you have stated. I will ask no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> further questions on that point.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I do have one further question:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you please tell me if, when I receive Chrome from you, I also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receive the patent licensing sufficient to use the Chrome package to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practice the patents listed in MPEG-LA's 'essential' patent list for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the decoding of H.264? &#160;I wouldn't want to break any laws.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you do.
</I>
Ah, that's interesting.


&gt;&gt;<i> I believe I know the answer, based on your statement &quot;No more or less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8230; than &#8230; ffmpeg&quot; as ffmpeg explicitly does not provide any patent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> licensing,
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i> Again, that was specifically about ffmpeg as a component of Google
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome, not about Google Chrome as a whole. &#160; Licensing of projects
</I>&gt;<i> that use a lot of open source components with a lot of different
</I>&gt;<i> licenses is a complicated matter, since each component can have a
</I>&gt;<i> license that is separate than the license for the work as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to make sure I am being as explicit as I can about what
</I>&gt;<i> each subject i am talking about is while still providing answers, so
</I>&gt;<i> that the answers are the actual answer, but as you can imagine, it's
</I>&gt;<i> tricky. &#160;It can be hard to differentiate between the questions people
</I>&gt;<i> want to know an answer that is more general than what they asked, and
</I>&gt;<i> those where they want to know just about that specific thing. &#160;When it
</I>&gt;<i> comes to matters like these, it's usually best for me to just answer
</I>&gt;<i> the question people actually asked explicitly, and let them ask
</I>&gt;<i> followups, than it is to try to anticipate what they really wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> know. &#160;It can come off as dodging at times, but i'm doing the best i
</I>&gt;<i> can ;)
</I>
Glad you did, since I think this discussion has clarified a lot of
things - at least for me. Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Silvia.
