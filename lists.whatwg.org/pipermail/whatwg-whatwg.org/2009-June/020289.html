Obviously a UA shouldn't crash, but i believe that it is up to the UA to determine how to achieve this -- eg. having a limit to allow a 1:1 relationship between workers and processes will have a much lower limit than an implementation that has a worker per thread model, or an m:n relationship between workers and threads/processes.

</I>&gt;<i>

Where in his email does Dmitry advocate upper limits?


&gt;<i> I believe if there's going to be any worker related
</I>&gt;<i> limits, it should realistically be a lower limit on the number of workers rather than an upper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Perhaps lower limits on how many workers are 'guaranteed' to be available
would be good, but that's fairly orthogonal to the original email.  What
he's proposing is a way to gracefully rate limit the number of workers
rather than having the OS running out of resources rate limit it.

I for one like the proposal and the analogy to what happens when you issue
10,000 XHRs at once.

</I>&gt;<i> In Chromium, workers are going to have their separate processes, at least
</I>&gt;<i> for now. So we quickly found that &quot;while(true) foo = new Worker(...)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> quickly consumes the OS resources :-) In fact, this will kill other browsers
</I>&gt;<i> too, and on some systems the unbounded number of threads will effectively
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;freeze&quot; the system beyond the browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We think about how to reasonably place limits on the resources consumed by
</I>&gt;<i> 'sea of workers'. Obviously, one could just limit a maxumum number of
</I>&gt;<i> parallel workers available to page or domain or browser. But what do you do
</I>&gt;<i> when a limit is reached? The Worker() constructor could return null or throw
</I>&gt;<i> exception. However, that seems to go against the spirit of the spec since it
</I>&gt;<i> usually does not deal with resource constraints. So it makes sense to look
</I>&gt;<i> for the most sensible implementation that tries best to behave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current idea is to let create as many Worker objects as requested, but not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily start them right away. So the resources are not allocated except
</I>&gt;<i> the thin JS wrapper. As long as workers terminate and the number of them
</I>&gt;<i> decreases below the limit, more workers from the &quot;ready queue&quot; could be
</I>&gt;<i> started. This allows to support implementation limits w/o exposing them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is similar to how a 'sea of XHRs' would behave. The test page here&lt;<A HREF="http://www.figushki.com/test/xhr/xhr10000.html">http://www.figushki.com/test/xhr/xhr10000.html</A>&gt; creates
</I>&gt;<i> 10,000 async XHR requests to distinct URLs and then waits for all of them to
</I>&gt;<i> complete. While it's obviosuly impossible to have 10K http connections in
</I>&gt;<i> parallel, all XHRs will be completed, given time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does it sound like a good way to avoid the resource crunch due to high
</I>&gt;<i> number of workers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
