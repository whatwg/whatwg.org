<PRE>Oh and one more thing:
Doesn't it seem strange that disconnect() causes an onclose event to be
dispatched? Should the method not be close() to be consistent with open(),
onopen, onclose?

</I>&gt;<i> connection (short of readyState polling). The spec also doesn't indicate
</I>&gt;<i> that the readyState should transition to CLOSED on connection failure.
</I>&gt;<i> (Description of the disconnect() method is careful to mention that it closes

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if the remote server closes the TCP connection, it generates a &quot;close&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event which marks the WebSocket as closed. It means that you could have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation where you post messages to a WebSocket which aren't received by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the server because  the connection is closed, but that's true regardless due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the asynchronous nature of the networking protocol.
