People don't usually think of Flash as part of the &quot;open Web&quot; (except for
certain Adobe evangelists).

Why don't you make a
&gt;<i> stand and shut down compatibility with plugins from flash, quicktime
</I>&gt;<i> and others? How long would Firefox last in the market if it were

</I>&gt;<i>

Even if supporting plugins was against our principles, which I'm not
convinced of, it's currently impossible to drop support for them and remain
relevant, so we'd have to compromise, but that wouldn't make plugins
&quot;right&quot;.

If patent-encumbered codecs delivered via &lt;video&gt; become essential for Web
browsing then we'll have to make some compromises, but that wouldn't change
their reprehensibility.
