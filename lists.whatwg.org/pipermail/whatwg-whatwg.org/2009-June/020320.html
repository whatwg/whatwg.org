</I>&gt;<i> That is indeed a valid concern. &#160;The obvious way to address it is to

</I>&gt;<i> page with that content where the license info is located. &#160;In this
</I>&gt;<i> scenario the JS viewer is merely a convenience, allowing you to view
</I>&gt;<i> the pictures without a page refresh, rather than a necessity.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully that's true anyway, for accessibility reasons!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus you get the best of both worlds - machine-readable data on the
</I>&gt;<i> individual pages, and you can still put human-readable license info on
</I>&gt;<i> the JS popup.
</I>
But why can't one have &quot;the best of both worlds&quot; without having to go
to separate pages for each photo?

&gt;&gt;<i> Surely that's common, and it's entirely feasible that different photos
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the page would have different licenses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it's that common for different photos on the page to
</I>&gt;<i> have different licenses (and preventing that scenario is just one more
</I>&gt;<i> reason to fight license proliferation), but even if true it's covered
</I>&gt;<i> by the above.
</I>
Depends what you mean by &quot;covered&quot;. I'd say the RDFa examples of this
&quot;cover&quot; it better in the sense that they don't impose an arbitrary
restriction that the license only applies to a single object (or I
suppose group of objects).

&gt;&gt;<i> Or another case: a weblog that includes third-party photo content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (could be your own photos too). You want to label your blog text with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one license, and the linked photos with another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is indeed not covered by @rel=license. &#160;Is it necessary to embed
</I>&gt;<i> the separate licensing information for the pictures in a
</I>&gt;<i> machine-readable way? &#160;It seems that just putting a human-readable
</I>&gt;<i> license link on each picture would work pretty well.
</I>
This isn't really my area, but I could imagine an organization (in
particular) wanting to include machine-readable license links (a la
CC).
