</I>
This is the solution that Firefox 3.5 uses. We use a pool of
relatively few OS threads (5 or so iirc). This pool is then scheduled
to run worker tasks as they are scheduled. So for example if you
create 1000 worker objects, those 5 threads will take turns to execute
the initial scripts one at a time. If you then send a message using
postMessage to 500 of those workers, and the other 500 calls
setTimeout in their initial script, the same threads will take turns
to run those 1000 tasks (500 message events, and 500 timer callbacks).

This is somewhat simplified, and things are a little more complicated
due to how we handle synchronous network loads (during which we freeze
and OS thread and remove it from the pool), but the above is the basic
idea.
