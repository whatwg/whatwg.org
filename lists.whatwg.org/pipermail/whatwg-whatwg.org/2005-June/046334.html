<PRE>Hello,

Sorry.  You are quite correct.  I've been sloppy with my language. 
(Hopefully I'll get it correct this time :-)  )

What I was talking about was HTTP Authentication.

&gt;<i>  - different applications have different concepts of being logged in. Some
</I>&gt;<i> may allow a user to login under different 'roles', some may allow them to
</I>&gt;<i> login to different areas of the site, etc. Any UI element embedded in the
</I>&gt;<i> browser chrome wouldn't work for many apps - it really should be flexible
</I>&gt;<i> enough for a page to have custom UI.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>  - if the browser had a button or variant of an html form that cleared the
</I>&gt;<i> user's credentials (username/password, certificate, etc) then that action
</I>&gt;<i> would not be reported to the server.
</I>
Which is generally how most sites have it today when people just close
the browser window (without logging out.)  (Although it is probably
not best practice.)

Typically I make sessions die if they aren't &quot;touched&quot; for a certain
period of time.  (And web pages have a piece of JavaScript that
&quot;touches&quot; the server, so that the session stays alive if the browser
window is left open, but the user hasn't done anything that causes
requires a &quot;hit&quot; to the server.)

&gt;<i> Would this fit the use case that server
</I>&gt;<i> developers have? My guess is that they would like to know when a user 'logs
</I>&gt;<i> out'. Which means that the browser sends a message to the server. This
</I>&gt;<i> message likely should be required to come from an authenticated user... else
</I>&gt;<i> the bad guys could log people out by guessing the right message. If the
</I>&gt;<i> client request is followed by a server response that clears out the
</I>&gt;<i> credentials, I think that lets developers have various concepts of 'logged
</I>&gt;<i> in' and 'logged out', implement it however they wish in both UI and server
</I>&gt;<i> code, and integrates with the protocol at some level.
</I>
So you want some standard &quot;hand shake&quot; for logging off.  I.e.,

    #1: The client sends a &quot;log me out&quot; message to the server.
    #2: The server receives the &quot;log me out&quot; message and &quot;cleans up&quot;.
    #3: The server sends a &quot;you are logged out&quot; message to the client.
    #4: The client clears the &quot;HTTP Authenication&quot; data.

Is that something along the lines of what you are suggesting?

As far as I know, there isn't any standard for this.  (I believe RFC
2617 defines the HTTP Authentication stuff.  And there wasn't anything
in there like this that I saw.  Nor am I aware of any other standard
for it.)

Maybe we need a standard for this.


See ya
