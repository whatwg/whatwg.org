</I>
    Note that I disagree. Problems with the precise form have plagued a 
lot of elements, such as &lt;img&gt;.

&gt;<i> [Ultimately] the absolute worst that can happen, even if an

</I>&gt;<i> somesuch is that people using speech browsers miss out on a two-second 
</I>&gt;<i> pause between sections and people using a text only browser fail to see 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;* * *&quot;.
</I>
   Well, probably in XHTML 2.0, but the only way that that would happen 
in HTML is if you intentionally used CSS alone for the separator. 
Remember that |alt| is required for &lt;img&gt;, so unless the author 
intentionally leaves out the &quot;* * *&quot;, it will be visible in text-only 
browsers, and intelligent aural browsers could interpret the string as a 
pause.

&gt;<i> Annoying? Yes, a little. Earthshatteringly awful? No, not 
</I>&gt;<i> really. Given that the total absence of a seperator is at worst 
</I>&gt;<i> irritating, protracted discussion about how best to represent them in 
</I>&gt;<i> markup is unnecessary.
</I>
    Well, actually there's a high potential for confusing readers, and a 
dramatic pause is not necessarily communicated by the boundary between 
sections. So, as worst, you've compromised the intended meaning of that 
portion of the document.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Where are all the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>people using AJAX (Worst. Name. Ever.) but going &quot;oh I could do all 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>this cool stuff if only I had  feature X&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Anyone skilled enough to use AJAX is skilled enough to implement 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>most of the features they want using DHTML. That isn't to say that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>they aren't asking for &quot;cool stuff&quot;, as I haven't exactly been polling 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>people on the subject, but it's clear that demand for new markup is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>less likely to come from those with the skills to implement similar 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>functionality on their own.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, they could hardly implement XMLHttpRequest in DHTML. That's sort 
</I>&gt;<i> of thing that makes new applications happen. There must be things that 
</I>&gt;<i> people are having to hack around now that have an elegant solution 
</I>&gt;<i> (indeed the spec already has a few examples - server sent DOM events, 
</I>&gt;<i> canvas, the DOMContentLoaded event (though I can't see that in the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> text yet...) and a few others.) Where are the ideas like those?
</I>
    I believe we've discussed a lot of those ideas right here in the 
WHATWG mailing list. Is there a specific area you feel has been neglected?
