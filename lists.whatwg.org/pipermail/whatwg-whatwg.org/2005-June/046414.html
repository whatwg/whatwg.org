</I>
I am using the current approach you describe, and as long as you have 
only a single additional window (the edit form) open it wouldn't be a 
problem, except if you want the user to explicitly complete a task, then 
modal would be required. In case of the addresses modal may not be 
required, it depends if you want to allow the user to delete a contact 
while the same contact is open in the edit form. It probably wont harm 
something in this case but it may in others. The problem starts in the 
edit form, if you want yet to open another window, lets say you want to 
attach a file to the address which is opened in the edit window, within 
the opened edit window you open a HTML File Manager. So you have 3 
windows open, the address view in the main web browser window, the edit 
form in a new window (without chrome) and the File Manager in another 
new window (without chrome). Wouldn't you use at least a modal window in 
case when you open the File Manager, if modal Windows would exist?

The File Manager is just one case, I face this problem many times where 
for an external edit form it would be convenient to open a modal sub 
window. So, Xforms may be a solution in that case if you don't require 
being the first window you open to be modal. By the way, I am simulating 
modal windows within the edit forms I use, but it is definitely a dirty 
hack to simulate multi web browser and multi os modal windows.
