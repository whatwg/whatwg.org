    I'm going to be lazy and ask you to provide the use case, since 
you're the one claiming one exists in the first place.

 &gt; In case of the addresses modal may not be
&gt;<i> required, it depends if you want to allow the user to delete a contact

</I>
    Simple way around that. Put the delete button in the editing window.

&gt;<i> It probably wont harm

</I>
    /me coughs in a manner that sounds very much like the words &quot;use case&quot;.

&gt;<i> The problem starts in the

</I>
    Every indication is that chromeless windows are on their way out.

 &gt; and the File Manager in another
&gt;<i> new window (without chrome). Wouldn't you use at least a modal window in 
</I>&gt;<i> case when you open the File Manager, if modal Windows would exist?
</I>
    Assuming the address can only be deleted by opening it in an address 
editing window and pressing &quot;delete&quot;, you have no use case in this 
situation, since the address can't be deleted until you return from the 
file manager. I would consider that this might be a problem in other 
situations, but I wonder if there aren't simple workarounds for it.

&gt;<i> The File Manager is just one case, I face this problem many times where 
</I>&gt;<i> for an external edit form it would be convenient to open a modal sub 
</I>&gt;<i> window.
</I>
    So your use case for modal windows is that there are many convenient 
situations where you'd want to open a modal window...

&gt;<i> So, Xforms may be a solution in that case if you don't require 
</I>&gt;<i> being the first window you open to be modal. By the way, I am simulating 
</I>&gt;<i> modal windows within the edit forms I use, but it is definitely a dirty 
</I>&gt;<i> hack to simulate multi web browser and multi os modal windows.
</I>
    Yeah, hacks like this run the risk of conflicting with native UI 
conventions, I'll give you that. However, it is widely accepted that 
modal UI is to be avoided anyway.
