</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I remember the domain restriction already exists.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Did it occur to anyone that this is all hostile to the user? You

</I>&gt;<i> block their access to an underlying window. This all smacks of &quot;let's

</I>
I wouldn't call users stupid, I would call web browsers stupid if they 
are not capable to let the user complete a task in the most productive 
and logical manner. However, I thought we are talking about web 
applications, or do you want start reading your newspaper within 
Dreamweaver, a Color Picker or your File Manager? Is that what you 
intend :-) ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have no objection to avoid them if they are not really required. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Though what doing in the rare cases where you can't avoid them, I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> guess Apple applications are still using modal windows in the one 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or other case, and they will remain for another decade or two. Or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is it different?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that two different issues have been conflated here: 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> modal windows (those which prevent their parent window from being 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> focused) and chromeless/navigationless windows. Whilst there are a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> very few occasions in which I can see modal windows being useful I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can also imagine that they would be abused for all sorts of nasty 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> things (even more instrusive adverts, for example).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The case where you require modal windows may be rare, yet they are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extremely useful in those cases, I remember they are on the web 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications wish list at &quot;Joel on software&quot; as well, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/oldnews/pages/June2004.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/oldnews/pages/June2004.html</A> , section 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thursday, June 17, 2004.**
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Yeah, but he really doesn't way why. I was hoping he'd have a use 
</I>&gt;<i> case in there somewhere...
</I>
Are you sure you need a more detailed use case?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yep, I am afraid that modal windows would be abused, as many other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things, though I consider some content you find on the web much more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harmful than modal windows could ever be, yet you allow authors to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publish content on the web :-).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thinking more about it, in my case I would require the modal windows 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on already opened chromeless windows, that could be a solution, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limiting the use of modal windows to already opened chromeless 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> windows, so that you can't open a modal window right away from a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regular web browser window, that would make it much more difficult to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abuse them. That is something I would be happy with and may cover 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most use cases where modal windows are required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Congratulations. You just reinvented &lt;xul:dialog&gt;. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Seriously, though, why not just standardize a subset of XUL 
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;sXUL&quot;) and use a compound document (XHTML + &quot;sXUL&quot;). We could make 
</I>&gt;<i> sXUL the standard for browser extensions while we're at it.
</I>
Pardon, there isn't much I know about Mozilla XUL in detail, XUL always 
sounded interesting, though as only Mozilla supports XUL ...
