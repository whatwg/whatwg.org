<PRE>Graham,

I have no objection to use forms via the browser back button if it is 
useful, I think Google or Yahoo search are typical examples as well. 
Though I am talking about applications where it is harmful or where it 
doesn't make sense to display the form again or to access it via the web 
browser history.

So should I allow it just because it is useful in some other cases? That 
doesn't work for me, simply said, something is wrong and needs to be fixed.

I am using pseudo modal windows for data manipulation in a lot of cases 
(DHTML wizards, etc run in pseudo modal mode), though they are pseudo 
because I jut open a new window without the chrome, I didn't have a 
single user which had any problem with it, though I remember one single 
user which didn't know about the web browser back button :-).

By the way, I don't break the web browser button on the regular main 
browser window, I simply don't use them in the opened pseudo modal 
windows if it is not necessary, respectively if it could harm something.

My point is, you can browse web documents, but you can't browse web 
applications, the browsing model is out of date.

Karl

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's where most problems start in regard to web applications, this

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, by introducing modal and modeless windows, view documents by

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, its not that simple, it may require to modify the caching model

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything else.

</I>&gt;<i> Having different types of windows doesn't make much sense to me. If

</I>&gt;<i> for a user to indicate that they trust you not to do anything evil. 
</I>&gt;<i> The most common way to do that at the moment is to run the application
