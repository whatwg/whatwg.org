Note I expressed no opinion on whether seperators as a concept are good 
or not, only the opinion that arguments over their precise form are 
worthless. Ultimatley the absolute worst that can happen, even if an 
author fails to use a semantic seperator and instead uses a graphic or 
somesuch is that people using speech browsers miss out on a two-second 
pause between sections and people using a text only browser fail to see 
&quot;* * *&quot;. Annoying? Yes, a little. Earthshatteringly awful? No, not 
really. Given that the total absence of a seperator is at worst 
irritating, protracted discussion about how best to represent them in 
markup is unnecessary.

Well, they could hardly implement XMLHttpRequest in DHTML. That's sort 
of thing that makes new applications happen. There must be things that 
people are having to hack around now that have an elegant solution 
(indeed the spec already has a few examples - server sent DOM events, 
canvas, the DOMContentLoaded event (though I can't see that in the spec 
text yet...) and a few others.) Where are the ideas like those?
