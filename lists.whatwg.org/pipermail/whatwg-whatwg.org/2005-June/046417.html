</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Simple way around that. Put the delete button in the editing window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It probably wont harm something in this case but it may in others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    /me coughs in a manner that sounds very much like the words &quot;use 
</I>&gt;<i> case&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem starts in the edit form, if you want yet to open another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window, lets say you want to attach a file to the address which is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opened in the edit window, within the opened edit window you open a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML File Manager. So you have 3 windows open, the address view in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the main web browser window, the edit form in a new window (without 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chrome)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Every indication is that chromeless windows are on their way out.
</I>
I would be very sad if that would happen. Its currently the only way to 
keep forms out of history and to unlock them from the back/next button.
So I would suggest to keep them and improve them rather than removing them.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the File Manager in another
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new window (without chrome). Wouldn't you use at least a modal window 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in case when you open the File Manager, if modal Windows would exist?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Assuming the address can only be deleted by opening it in an 
</I>&gt;<i> address editing window and pressing &quot;delete&quot;, you have no use case in 
</I>&gt;<i> this situation, since the address can't be deleted until you return 
</I>&gt;<i> from the file manager. I would consider that this might be a problem 
</I>&gt;<i> in other situations, but I wonder if there aren't simple workarounds 
</I>&gt;<i> for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The File Manager is just one case, I face this problem many times 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where for an external edit form it would be convenient to open a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modal sub window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    So your use case for modal windows is that there are many 
</I>&gt;<i> convenient situations where you'd want to open a modal window...
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, Xforms may be a solution in that case if you don't require being 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first window you open to be modal. By the way, I am simulating 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modal windows within the edit forms I use, but it is definitely a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dirty hack to simulate multi web browser and multi os modal windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Yeah, hacks like this run the risk of conflicting with native UI 
</I>&gt;<i> conventions, I'll give you that. However, it is widely accepted that 
</I>&gt;<i> modal UI is to be avoided anyway.
</I>
I have no objection to avoid them if they are not really required. 
Though what doing in the rare cases where you can't avoid them, I guess 
Apple applications are still using modal windows in the one or other 
case, and they will remain for another decade or two. Or is it different?
