Well if you can think of an easy way to improve them so that they a) 
obviously belong to the browser and b) clearly display the full location 
then I'm sure UA vendors will be happy to hear from you. Otherwise, the 
internet being the way it is, chromeless windows, on the public internet 
at least, have a short life expectancy.

It seems to me that two different issues have been conflated here: modal 
windows (those which prevent their parent window from being focused) and 
chromeless/navigationless windows. Whilst there are a very few occasions 
in which I can see modal windows being useful I can also imagine that 
they would be abused for all sorts of nasty things (even more instrusive 
adverts, for example).
