   Did it occur to anyone that this is all hostile to the user? You 
prevent the user from accessing controls for browser (buttons, menus, et 
cetera). You prevent the user from going to another domain. You block 
their access to an underlying window. This all smacks of &quot;let's control 
the users, because the users are stupid&quot;.

    Yeah, but he really doesn't way why. I was hoping he'd have a use 
case in there somewhere...

&gt;<i> Yep, I am afraid that modal windows would be abused, as many other 
</I>&gt;<i> things, though I consider some content you find on the web much more 
</I>&gt;<i> harmful than modal windows could ever be, yet you allow authors to 
</I>&gt;<i> publish content on the web :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking more about it, in my case I would require the modal windows on 
</I>&gt;<i> already opened chromeless windows, that could be a solution, limiting 
</I>&gt;<i> the use of modal windows to already opened chromeless windows, so that 
</I>&gt;<i> you can't open a modal window right away from a regular web browser 
</I>&gt;<i> window, that would make it much more difficult to abuse them. That is 
</I>&gt;<i> something I would be happy with and may cover most use cases where modal 
</I>&gt;<i> windows are required.

    Congratulations. You just reinvented &lt;xul:dialog&gt;. :)

    Seriously, though, why not just standardize a subset of XUL (&quot;sXUL&quot;) 
and use a compound document (XHTML + &quot;sXUL&quot;). We could make sXUL the 
standard for browser extensions while we're at it.
