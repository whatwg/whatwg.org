I can't follow what you mean, sounds like I could access each wizard 
page via the browser back/next button, it means it would be in the web 
browser history, though it shouldn't be there, with or without Ajax.

&gt;<i>

</I>
That's new to me. Can we live without modal windows from now? Is that 
somewhere written?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know many without a back/next button, but none without modal window 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support comes into my mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Considering that back/next buttons were invented later, that proves 
</I>&gt;<i> little. For instance, any kind of preference or settings dialogs you 
</I>&gt;<i> can think of could be put in a collapsible sidebar. I personally 
</I>&gt;<i> worked on a project where they had forward and back buttons for three 
</I>&gt;<i> different levels. Wizards are a perfect example of back/next as well, 
</I>&gt;<i> and there are plenty of those.
</I>
Yep, Wizards are perfect, but not in the web browser history and not 
locked to the web browser back/next button.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is the web browser damned to limit it to back/next only? Will the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only alternative be Java Webstart, Microsofts XAML or Flash to get a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I can't think of much you can't do with these technologies that you

</I>
Am I missing something?

&gt;<i> It's simply faster or has more native features. For instance, menus 
</I>&gt;<i> are easily simulated by DHTML-based web apps. Similarly, you could 
</I>&gt;<i> easily simulate modal windows by using a few &lt;div&gt; elements and 
</I>&gt;<i> disabling various controls. Considering modal-anything is generally 
</I>&gt;<i> considered bad UI, I don't think we should encourage it, especially 
</I>&gt;<i> when it's so incompatible with current browser usage.
</I>
The &quot;you could easily simulate modal windows&quot; is an illusion, its a 
dirty hack and yet you have no modal windows.

Nobody talks about modal-anything, its an enhancement to the somehow 
limited back/next model, among other limitations.
