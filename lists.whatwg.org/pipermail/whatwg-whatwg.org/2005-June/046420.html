Yep, I would be very happy with this approach, to lock chromeless 
windows to the user agent and to always show the full location, and that 
you can't connect to another domain than of the domain from where you 
opened the window. This modification shouldn't be that difficult to 
implement for user agent vendors, I think... and hope. As far as I 
remember the domain restriction already exists.

The case where you require modal windows may be rare, yet they are 
extremely useful in those cases, I remember they are on the web 
applications wish list at &quot;Joel on software&quot; as well,

Yep, I am afraid that modal windows would be abused, as many other 
things, though I consider some content you find on the web much more 
harmful than modal windows could ever be, yet you allow authors to 
publish content on the web :-).

Thinking more about it, in my case I would require the modal windows on 
already opened chromeless windows, that could be a solution, limiting 
the use of modal windows to already opened chromeless windows, so that 
you can't open a modal window right away from a regular web browser 
window, that would make it much more difficult to abuse them. That is 
something I would be happy with and may cover most use cases where modal 
windows are required.
