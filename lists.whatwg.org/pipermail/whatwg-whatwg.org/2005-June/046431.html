     Well, you have a web page you have a link to on your desktop that
contains info you need for the wizard. Your computer is set to open URLs
in existing windows. You realize your mistake and go to hit the back
button, but it's not there.

&gt;<i> And, there is no need to restore the state, why

</I>
     You're the one who keeps bringing up the chromeless window.
Personally, I'm greatly annoyed by web apps that are not
back-button-aware. I can't count all the times I've gone from a listing
page to a page for an item in the listing, then pressed the back button
only to find that I have to press the actual link that says &quot;return to
the listing&quot; to get back.

     People know where the back and next buttons are. They use them all
the time. Why would you not design your web app to take advantage of a
piece of UI that the user is so familiar with?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and still have the last directory I was on open.
</I>
     (Note that I was explaining that file dialogs didn't have to be
separate modal windows in user agents. I was not suggesting that web
standards /require/ non-modal, in-window file dialogs.)

</I>
     I'm not sure what you mean. User agents are free to use modal
dialogs all they want, because HTML doesn't specify that things like
file dialogs be non-modal. So if someone is trying to upload a file, the
method they use to locate the file is not defined by HTML. If the user
agent vendor feels that a modal file dialog is most appropriate, so be it.

     Color pickers aren't in HTML, but perhaps they should be:

|<i> &lt;label&gt;Foreground Color: &lt;input type=&quot;color&quot; name=&quot;foreground&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
</I>
     Now, I've seen quite a few color pickers that /aren't/ modal, that
are either flat controls or temporary pop-up style controls like a
combobox. Therefore, for the markup above, the implementation is the
domain of the UA, not HTML.

     That's important to note. HTML isn't the place for behavioral
features. At the very least we should probably be talking about this
specifically in the context of Javascript, in which case we should be
talking about how a web app might degrade with Javascript turned off.

     If you're talking about DHTML color pickers, I think the
combobox-style approach is pretty well established in that case.

     As far as subforms, wizards are probably a bad use case. Granted,
I've seen subforms, but I've also seen tree controls that do the exact
same thing. But let's assume there is a specific use case for this anyway.

     First of all, if you allow for chromeless windows, and you can
simple disable all form controls on the parent wizard window when the
user presses the button to go to the subform. When the subform returns,
you would then reenable all controls. All the modal state really does is
keep the user from putting the parent in front of the child, or from
terminating the parent, but I think we're in &quot;stupid user&quot; territory here.

     Just had a thought. You could use &lt;switch&gt; and some scripting to
avoid the browser history. Just have the entire wizard inside the
&lt;switch&gt; element:

|<i> &lt;switch&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;section id=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;h&gt;Wizard Page 1&lt;/h&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;p&gt;...Content for Page...&lt;/p&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:document.getElementById('s2').setActive()&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>       Next
</I>|<i>     &lt;/a&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;/section&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;section id=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;h&gt;Wizard Page 2&lt;/h&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;p&gt;...Content for Page...&lt;/p&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:document.getElementById('s1').setActive()&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>       Previous
</I>|<i>     &lt;/a&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:document.getElementById('s3').setActive()&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>       Next
</I>|<i>     &lt;/a&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;/section&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;section id=&quot;s3&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;h&gt;Wizard Page 3&lt;/h&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;p&gt;...Content for Page...&lt;/p&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:document.getElementById('s2').setActive()&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>       Previous
</I>|<i>     &lt;/a&gt;
</I>|<i>     &lt;button name=&quot;finish&quot;&gt;
</I>|<i>       Finish
</I>|<i>     &lt;/button&gt;
</I>|<i>   &lt;/section&gt;
</I>|<i> &lt;/switch&gt;
</I>
    This wouldn't solve the subform problem, though.

    Bottom line, though, is that if the parent window is chromeless, you 
can simply go to the subform instead of bringing it up in a new window. 
It's functionally the same without having to worry about multiple windows.

    Not entirely.

&gt;<i> If that doesn't make it clear I

</I>
    If you can't show definitively why modal windows are superior UI and 
worth the possible security and ad-related headaches, then you are 
wasting your time. Not that I'm not listening. I can see that modal 
dialogs are nice for specific situations. I just don't see those 
situations popping up all that much in a non-native application.
