<PRE>This seems reasonable to me.

Is each element in this stack treated as having its own stacking context? I
assume so, but you'd better say so.

- Define a new pseudo-element ::backdrop which applies to any element in
&gt;<i>  such a stack; it addresses a box that exactly covers the viewport
</I>&gt;<i>  immediately below the element in the stack, in the same stacking layer,
</I>&gt;<i>  whose only applicable properties are the 'background' properties.
</I>&gt;<i>  (Alternatively, make it a generic box with properties initially set to
</I>&gt;<i>  have position:fixed and positioned to exactly cover the viewport, but
</I>&gt;<i>  I don't see much point in letting people fiddle with this box's
</I>&gt;<i>  positioning, display type, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's probably more work to make all non-background properties inapplicable
than it would be to simply treat it like ::before/::after generated content.

But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
that you may be children of your Father in heaven. ... If you love those
who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors
doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more
than others?&quot; [Matthew 5:43-47]
