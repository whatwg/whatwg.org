A task queued on a Document is associated with that Document and can only 
be processed when that document is active.


&gt;<i> &gt; But in general, there's not expected to be any talking back. If you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want something where the handler talks back to the page that provided 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the data, then you should use Web Intents. registerProtocolHandler() 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and registerContentHandler() are intended for things like mail clients 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (mailto:) or PDF viewers, which do not talk back. Indeed in the common 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use case, you just click the link and the entire browsing context gets 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replaced, so there's nothing to talk back _to_.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was prompted to write the original email by a Mozilla blog post that 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested talking back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It also seems bad for web APIs to break under simple composition like 
</I>&gt;<i> this; especially when there's an easy fix available.
</I>
I think it's unsurprising that a feature would not be suitable for a task 
for which it was not designed. Turns out &lt;canvas&gt; is really bad at cross- 
document communication too. ;-)

In the case of &lt;iframe&gt;, there's no problem since you can't post anything 
to a parent that isn't the parent that spawned you.

In the case of window.open, it's true that the opener could have navigated 
by the time you try to communicate back. That's a general problem with 
window.open(), though; it's not specific to register*Handler(). The 
solution is to not use window.open(), which is in any case bad UI.


&gt;<i> &gt; For such an example, you can just use a fallback section in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appcache manifest. (Or a fragment identifier, indeed.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right, the obvious thing to do is use the fragment identifier, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that's got some security problems. With a small tweak we can make this 
</I>&gt;<i> safe and easy.
</I>
I don't understand the security problem. Could you give a concrete example 
of an attack scenario?


&gt;<i> &gt; Why would a mail client talk back to its opener?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might not, but some RPH handlers will.
</I>
Why? What's the use case?


&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand the attack scenario. Sure, a Web page can open 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another Web page with arbitrary arguments. Why does it matter here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. An RPH dispatch is different from a direct load because it 
</I>&gt;<i> communicates a user choice to the RPH handler. I explained above how a 
</I>&gt;<i> handler might use this information.
</I>
I don't see how this difference affects the security here.


&gt;<i> 2. An RPH dispatch comes from the browser, so URL parameters can be 
</I>&gt;<i> trusted; whereas they cannot be trusted in a load from another web page.
</I>
I don't see how they can be viewed as &quot;trusted&quot;.


&gt;<i> With a small change, we can prevent a client page from faking an RPH 
</I>&gt;<i> dispatch to a handler page.
</I>
It's just a page load, not a &quot;fake RPH dispatch&quot;. I don't understand the 
problem here.
