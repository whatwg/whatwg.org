I think playback probably is the most useful. The use case here was 
updating a playback scrub bar with colour for where the user has already 
watched the video, and zero-length entries aren't useful for that.

I've made a note of this e-mail to fix the spec, but in the absence of 
further information or opinions from anyone else, I'd go with playback as 
you suggest.
