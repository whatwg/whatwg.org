</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A follow up about this proposal:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Based on the feedbacks we got on this list we've implemented the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following API to do experiments in Chrome:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  DataTransferItem.getAsEntry(in EntryCallback callback)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this actually need to be async?  The only information you need to
</I>&gt;<i> create the Entry are the filename and the file type (file or directory),
</I>&gt;<i> which the browser can load before performing the drop, so no file I/O is
</I>&gt;<i> needed here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I wanted to make it synchronous, but determining the file type (file or
directory) usually requires blocking file I/O operation, which could spoil
the async nature of this proposal if we perform the blocking stat operation
on every drag-enter event.


&gt;<i> which takes a callback that returns FileEntry or DirectoryEntry if it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for drop event and the item's kind is 'file'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right now it's prefixed therefore its actual name in Chrome is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'webkitGetAsEntry'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We use kind=='file' in a broader definition here (i.e. a file path which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be either regular file or directory file) and didn't add a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind for directories.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Btw we've also implemented DataTransferItem.getAsFile(), so apps can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call either getAsFile or webkitGetAsEntry for kind=='file' item)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If getAsEntry is synchronous, a separate getAsFile method isn't needed.
</I>&gt;<i> You can just say transfer.getAsEntry().file(), and reduce the API surface
</I>&gt;<i> area a bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  As for lifetime and toURL() issue, which was the biggest concern in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> past discussion, we decided not to support toURL/resolveURL on  Entries for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drag-and-drop, so that it won't leak reference or expose GC period.  A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dragged file can be accessed only while the script has the Entry instance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (as well as we do for File object).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with this.  toURL makes some sense within the sandboxed
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem, but it just doesn't for non-sandboxed use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We eventually aim to support structured cloning of Entries but it's not
</I>&gt;<i> there yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is sort of a separate issue, but it would be nice to eventually get
</I>&gt;<i> full structured cloning support, with support for File/Entry into
</I>&gt;<i> IndexedDB.  That is, let me store an Entry into IndexedDB, so I can later
</I>&gt;<i> restore it and regain access to the file.  For example, if a user grants my
</I>&gt;<i> music player web app access to his MP3 collection, I can store the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting Entry in IndexedDB (or History), and the user can load my web app
</I>&gt;<i> later and start playing music, without having to re-open the directory
</I>&gt;<i> every time.  This needs further thought around user expectations of how
</I>&gt;<i> long access grants last, but hopefully it can be worked out eventually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (We don't need to go into this here; just mentioning it again while it's
</I>&gt;<i> on my mind, so people can be thinking about it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Supporting structured cloning sounds like the right direction to me too.


&gt;<i> As for &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; support I am thinking about adding &quot;AsEntries&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute (so that we do not need to do the automatic recursive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files/directories retrieval when the attribute is specified) and &quot;entries&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> field, but haven't done anything yet.  (Open to further suggestions)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds right, too.  This would make File access from &lt;input&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete.  (File would still avoid at least one asynchronous call for
</I>&gt;<i> non-recursive use cases, though, so people will still use it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for showing your support, I hope we can uniformly support Entry both
in &lt;input&gt; and native drag-and-drop.


&gt;<i>  I hope we can get valuable user feedbacks (as well as from yours) based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds good.  Once we've played around with this for a while, we can
</I>&gt;<i> start thinking about how to safely expose write access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes!
