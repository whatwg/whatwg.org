</I>
I presume it uses this in conjunction with an &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt; link with a 
target=&quot;&quot; attribute to load the handler in an iframe.


&gt;<i> In the example code, the targetOrigin for this postMessage invocation is 
</I>&gt;<i> '*', while also noting that this is not secure. AFAICT, there is no API 
</I>&gt;<i> that the intent handler can reliably use to determine the correct 
</I>&gt;<i> targetOrigin for this postMessage invocation.
</I>
How can the origin be anything other than the origin of the page that 
triggered the link?


&gt;<i> I suggest fixing this problem by adding a new readonly DOMString that 
</I>&gt;<i> contains the correct origin for the postMessage invocation; perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> document.origin. So the response invocation would then be coded as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   window.parent.postMessage('my response data', document.origin);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps a different name or location is better for this field, so I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> defer to the editor's judgment.
</I>
You can work out your own origin from window.location's members, but I 
don't see how this helps you determine the origin of your parent. There's 
a separate thread about adding a way to obtain your parent's origin, but 
again, I don't see why you would need it in this case. Can you elaborate 
on what the attack scenario you are envisaging is?


&gt;<i> The second problem with RPH is that the handler page doesn't have a
</I>&gt;<i> way of reliably getting the URL of the content to be handled from the
</I>&gt;<i> browser. In order to work in offline scenarios, the RPH handler must
</I>&gt;<i> put the %s placeholder in the fragment of its handler's URL.
</I>
It's not clear to me that it makes sense to have an offline protocol 
handler. What kind of protocol do you have in mind?


&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this means that other content in the browser could
</I>&gt;<i> modify the content URL before the handler reads it.
</I>
Well, any content can load any URL, so it doesn't matter whether the URL 
is in the fragment identifier or the path or anything else, surely.


&gt;<i> For example, an attacker could open a window on a victim web page. The 
</I>&gt;<i> victim web page then opens an &lt;iframe&gt; on a content URL that triggers 
</I>&gt;<i> RPH. The attacker then navigates the &lt;iframe&gt; so that its 
</I>&gt;<i> window.location contains a different content URL.
</I>
How can the attacker navigate that iframe? Surely it would not be allowed 
to navigate it, per the &quot;allowed to navigate&quot; definition in HTML.


&gt;<i> The intent handler sees a request coming from the victim page, but with 
</I>&gt;<i> a content URL specified by the attacker. A related problem is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> intent handler has no way to distinguish whether its URL was loaded via 
</I>&gt;<i> the browser's RPH handling, or whether the client page directly 
</I>&gt;<i> navigated to the intent handler's URL. Both of these problems could be 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed by adding another readonly DOMString to the API that contains the 
</I>&gt;<i> %s data for the RPH invocation.
</I>
I don't understand why it matters how the URL was invoked.
