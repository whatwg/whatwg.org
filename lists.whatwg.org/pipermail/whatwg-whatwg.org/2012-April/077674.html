The RPH handler doesn't need to know which is the legit site. The RPH
handler just needs to know that it's getting the RPH data from the
site that the user was interacting with, not some other unseen site
running in the browser. Putting the %s data in the window.location
lets an attacker overwrite it.

&gt;&gt;<i> The important thing to understand here is that a communication channel

</I>
That's exactly right! The whole window.location communication path is
vulnerable to tampering, so we need some other way to communicate the
RPH %s data, such as a DOM field.

With appcache fallback, it's not necessary to use only the URL
fragment for an offline scenario to work, which makes talking about
the URL fragment in this scenario extraneous. Assuming the mailto RPH
handler is using appcache with a fallback, this whole scenario works
if the %s data is in the path or query. The problem is that the whole
window.location is a communication channel that is vulnerable to
tampering within the browser.

&gt;&gt;<i> Rather than quibble about how a future attacker might make use of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vulnerability in some future application, the right thing to do is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eliminate the vulnerability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how what you propose eliminates the vulnerability.
</I>
The vulnerability is that window.location can be overwritten by other
code running in the browser. For that reason, I'm proposing we use a
different channel to communicate RPH %s data from the client to the
RPH handler. I'm swapping in a tamper-proof channel for one that can
be tampered with.

That window.location is vulnerable to tampering is widely agreed. We
should be able to easily agree to not use it when we have a
tamper-proof alternative. This should be easy.
