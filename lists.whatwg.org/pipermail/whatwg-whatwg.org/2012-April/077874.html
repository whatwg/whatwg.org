Ha, yes! 21 months later and it's indeed solved through the same
mechanism that synchronisation of multiple audio/video tracks is
solved.


&gt;&gt;<i> * How to associate and expose such extra audio and video tracks that are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided out-of-band to the Web browser? This is probably a next-version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue since it's rather difficult to implement in the browser. It

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean here.
</I>
It was the difference between in-band tracks and separate files. Also
solved by now.


&gt;&gt;<i> * Whether to include a multiplexed download functionality in browsers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for media resources, where the browser would do the multiplexing of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active media resource with all the active text, audio and video tracks?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This could be a context menu functionality, so is probably not so much a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to include in the HTML5 spec, but it's something that browsers can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider to provide. And since muxing isn't quite as difficult a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality as e.g. decoding video, it could actually be fairly cheap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this seems out of scope for the spec.
</I>
Thread closed. :-)

Cheers,
Silvia.
