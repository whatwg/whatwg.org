There was a lot of e-mail on this topic, but a stark lack of descriptions 
of actual end-user use cases for these features, as will be clear in the 
responses I give below.

A quick reminder therefore that in adding features to HTML the first thing 
we want to look for is the problem that we are trying to solve. Without 
that, we don't know how to evaluate the proposed solutions! See this FAQ:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F</A>

</I>
If the problem is making sure the user can stream a resource with a 
bitrate such that the user can play the stream in real time as it is 
downloading, then the better solution seems to be a rate-negotiating media 
protocol, not an API to expose the frame rate. The frame rate may have 
nothing at all to do with the bandwidth: for example, if the user has a 
software decoder, the framerate could be low because the CPU is overloaded 
due to the user running a complicated simulation in another process. 
Similarly, the download rate could be slow because the bandwidth was 
throttled by the user because the user is doing other things and is happy 
to wait for the video to download in the background so that the user can 
watch it later.

How is this to be determined? In particular, for example, what should

The user can presumably tell if the video can play without stuttering just 
by watching it stutter or not stutter. Why would the page need to know? 
Surely there's nothing the page can do about it -- e.g., the playback 
might just be stuttering because the user agent is intentionally dropping 
every other frame because the video is actually not visible on the screen 
currently, or because the video is being played back at 2x speed.


&gt;<i> *) maxBytesPerSecond: it can be used to determine the bandwidth of the

</I>
Only if nobody else is using the connection at the same time. What if two 
pages are both open at the same time and both use this to determine the 
connection speed? They'll start intefeering with each other.

The API supports seeking to any frame, if you know its precise time

That's a limitation of the implementation, not of the specification.

An &quot;advance one frame&quot; or &quot;rewind one frame&quot; API would be reasonable, I 
think; would it address your use case? What is your use case, exactly? 
Film editing or some such?


&gt;<i> Likewise for audio.

What is a &quot;frame&quot; for the purposes of audio?

Why do you need an exact time code for this, as opposed to knowing what 
the user was watching when the user requested a pause/jump/cut?


&gt;<i> So being able to ensure that an exact SMPTE timecode is show - or know

Why is the precise time in fractions of a second not sufficient?

Why not always use the &quot;floating point value&quot;?

</I>
Why isn't a time in seconds sufficient?

Given that SMPTE timecodes essentially only make sense for some very 
specific frame rates, and in particular given the rather esoteric nature 
of legacy drop frame timecodes, it seems more sensible to just convert 
SMPTE timecodes to seconds for internal purposes when dealing with the 
media API, and display them as SMPTE timecodes for users who expect them. 
It's not clear to me what benefit there would be to actually requiring 
that user agents fake the SMPTE timecodes.

If you have fixed frame rates, it's trivial to do the conversion to and 
from SMTPE timecode in JavaScript; you don't need any direct support from 
the media element API.

We can address this using a .advanceOneFrame()/.rewindOneFrame() method. 
Would that work? Does it have to be more generic? How would we handle 
formats that don't have well-defined frames?

This is already specced.

This would be addressed by the proposal in the bug cited above.

That's not how we design APIs -- if we try to solve all possible problems,

This is not a problem we need to worry about in the API, since the

Can you elaborate on these reasons? Raw data is often interesting, but not
