</I>
Rather than an element just for Web Intents, I think we'd be better off 
with an element that can be used for all the registration mechanisms: 
registerProtocolHandler(), registerContentHandler(), and Web Intents.

Similarly, rather than Web Intents only being declarative, we should 
follow the pattern set by registerProtocolHandler() and register- 
ContentHandler() and also support an API. This would make these three 
mechanisms consistent with each other such that they can be considered a 
single feature, not three features.

Looking at the three features, it seems they break down as follows:

   a handler registered using registerContentHandler() triggers when a URL 
   with a particular type is opened, and results in the URL being passed 
   to another URL that is opened.

   a handler registered using registerProtocolHandler() triggers when a 
   URL with a particular scheme is opened, and results in the URL being 
   passed to another URL that is opened.

   a handler registered using Web Intents triggers when a method is 
   invoked on another page, and results in a URL being opened and its 
   JavaScript context being given the information passed to the method.

In the first two, the behaviour can be implemented server-side or 
client-side; in the last case the behaviour must be done in JS.

We can pretend that in the case of the first two, it's equivalent to an 
&quot;open&quot; action with the URL as the data. This would mean that the intent 
data, in the case of a URL open, would just be the URL string. We can 
similarly pretend that in the case of the latter, it's fetching the page 
like in the %s case, but since there's no %s, it doesn't put the data in 
the URL. Or alternatively, we can say that because the data is a 
structured clone rather than a URL, you replace the %s, if any, with the 
empty string.

Thus we reach a point where we can describe all three as a common set of 
registration features:

   1. select type of handler:
       - url
       - structured clone
   2. select action
       - &quot;open&quot;
       - &quot;share&quot;
       - &quot;edit&quot;
       - etc...
   3. optionally select one other further filter
       - type
       - scheme (only allowed for url handlers)
   4. select URL to use as handler
   5. select user-facing title
   6. select disposition (replace page, new page, or overlay)

When a URL is opened that matches a registered handler for the &quot;open&quot; 
action and the appropriate scheme or type, imply an intent for that URL 
handler, with any returned result being discarded.

The handling can then be a single mechanism for all of the above:

   1. If it's a URL handler, replace %s with the URL.
   2. Set up the browsing context per the disposition.
   3. Open the URL.
   4. Set up the Window.intent API.

So, what information would we need for registration?

   payload type: a url, or an object to clone
   action: a string
   filter: either a MIME type, or a scheme
   url: the url to call
   title: the user-visible name of the handler
   disposition: how to show the handler (replace, new tab, popup overlay)

My suggestion then would be to add an element similar to what you suggest, 
as well as an API similar to the existing one.

The element could be something like:

   &lt;intent
     action=&quot;edit&quot;     intent action, e.g. open or edit, default &quot;share&quot;
     type=&quot;image/png&quot;  MIME type filter [1], default &quot;*/*&quot;
     scheme=&quot;mailto&quot;   Scheme filter [1] [2], default omitted
     href=&quot;&quot;           Handler URL [2], default &quot;&quot;
     title=&quot;Foo&quot;       Handler user-visible name, required attribute
     disposition=&quot;&quot;    &quot;replace&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, or &quot;overlay&quot;, default &quot;overlay&quot;
   &gt;&lt;/intent&gt;

[1] Only one of type=&quot;&quot; and scheme=&quot;&quot; is allowed.
[2] scheme=&quot;&quot; is only allowed if href=&quot;&quot; contains %s.

The API could be something like:

  void registerIntentHandler(DOMString action, DOMString type, DOMString url, DOMString title, DOMString disposition);
  DOMString isIntentHandlerRegistered(DOMString action, DOMString type, DOMString url);
  void unregisterIntentHandler(DOMString action, DOMString type, DOMString url);

The disposition of registerContentHandler() and registerProtocolHandler() 
would always be &quot;replace&quot;. The /url/ argument of registerProtocolHandler() 
would not be allowed to contain %s.

A handler, once registered, would remain so until it was explicitly 
removed with unregisterIntentHandler() or removed by the user, as now for 
the other handler APIs; or, for registrations done with the declarative 
form, would remain until the user returns to the same page and the page 
returns a 200, 404, or 410 response (at which point it would be 
unregistered until such time as the &lt;intent&gt; elment is seen again, which 
could happen that very same page load).

Removing the element from the DOM would have no effect; adding it to the 
DOM (e.g. by the parser or script) is what would trigger a declarative 
registration.


I'm not hugely happy with the idea of introducing yet another 
empty-element-with-an-end-tag to HTML, especially here where I really 
don't see much of a need for fallback. Adding it to the &lt;head&gt; would make 
sense but would be very expensive. I don't really see another element we 
could reuse sanely, though (overloading &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;link&gt; doesn't really 
work here as they don't have the same semantics really).


From a purely spec-editorial perspective, it seems to make more sense to 
have all of this in one spec, rather than split across multiple specs. If 
you would like, I'd be willing to spec this all in the HTML spec (which 
would especially make sense if we do add another element); alternatively, 
we should really consider moving the existing register*Handler() stuff to 
the same spec as the intent stuff.

Trying to fit the registration components listed above into &lt;meta&gt; really

That is true, but adding this to the body seems weird too.

How common will fallback be on the short term and on the long term?

We have this mechanism for, e.g., &lt;iframe&gt;, and at the moment it's mostly 
just an ugly wart in the language.

Adding new attributes is reasonably trivial in practice. My concern with 
reusing &lt;meta&gt; or &lt;link&gt; is more that it doesn't really fit the semantics 
of the existing attributes or processing model.

Both have strong use cases. I think we should support both. In the case of 
data being cloned, it doesn't make much sense to upload it, so naturally 
that would just be provided client-side, as described above. For URLs, 
though, the opposite is the case -- you will usually want to fetch the URL 
somehow, which is almost always going to require work on the server side 
since the client typically won't have access rights to obtain the data 
(for content handlers) or open the connection (for protocol handlers).

I don't think wildcard matching really makes sense. In particular, I'm not 
aware of any service that can honestly say it supports image/*, or indeed 
any other topleveltype/*.

There's also the following somewhat artificial attack scenario:

 1. User is tricked into going to victim.example.com. An injection attack 
    is used to register a custom handler for vicitim.example.com. Not 
    knowing that the user is at victim.example.com, and given a misleading
    handler title and so forth, the user adds the handler, thinking it is
    something else.
 2. User is tricked into going to some other site that invokes the 
    handler.
 3. The user, thinking the handler is something else, picks it (it would
    probably be the only such handler in this scenario, with the action
    being a unique one for the attack).
 4. The user, confused as to which site he is visiting, performs an action
    on the victim site, thinking he is on some other site. Maybe the site 
    is made to appear like another via some injected CSS. (Hey, we're 
    assuming the site is susceptible to injection in the first place.)
 
A lot has to go wrong for this to really happen, though.


&gt;<i> Another threat model related to this is cross-origin registration. If an

Yes, I see no reason to allow cross-origin registration. The existing 
methods do not allow that.

</I>
The API does expose this information.

I don't see why they wouldn't want this information with the declarative 
approach as well. GMail, for instance, asked to be able to tell if they 
were registered so that they could display more elaborate documentation.

That's not a big concern, so long as the semantics make sense.

With intent registration, I'm not sure they do.

e.g. with &lt;link href=&quot;&quot;&gt; you'd want to be able to register a URL with a %s 
segment for content/protocol handlers, but that's no longer a valid URL, 
so it's weird to use href=&quot;&quot; which currently requires a valid URL.

Similarly, using type=&quot;&quot; to mean the filter rather than the type of the 
content at the href=&quot;&quot; URL would mean the type=&quot;&quot; attribute has a 
different meaning based on context.

Similarly, we have an action=&quot;&quot; attribute on &lt;link&gt; that defines the 
disposition, but it has different values than what we're talking about 
here, so it would be weird to reuse it, and would be weird not to.

&lt;meta&gt; is also a weird case because we'd basically be reusing the element 
but none of the attributes, and it already has three different roles.

I guess that might be common, yes. Though most browsers don't allow you to

that.

I wouldn't say &quot;completely abhorent&quot;, but having conditions that control

I don't think it's as big an issue as you suggest.

The only reason I think it doesn't make sense to reuse &lt;meta&gt; is that it 
would add a fourth orthogonal processing model for that element. If 
intents were more like one of the existing models, it would make perfect 
sense to reuse &lt;meta&gt;, even with a dozen new attributes. Attribute are 
cheap. Elements are ridiculously more expensive.

How would they know what scheme to check?

Also, the user would typically have to agree to registering the handler 
for this, so they would have an idea that the scheme was dodgy. A bigger 
threat, IMHO, is registering a URL with a session ID, much like a site 
could redirect the page to a URL with a session ID when registering an 
&lt;intent&gt; and then check the URL when invoking the handler.

An empty picker isn't really the use case being addressed by these

The use case is for a site that wants to show more elaborate advocacy for

Intents spec. Here are some comments on it. I hope they are helpful.

- Nothing seems to ever actually invoke the structured clone algorithm, so 
it's unclear when that should run. In particular, I don't understand when 
ports get cloned. Is it in the constructor? In startActivity?

- What does it mean for a member of Intent to only be present at certain 
times? (e.g. &quot;Only present when the Intent object is delivered to the 
Service page&quot;)

- A lot of the spec seems to be lacking in formal requirements; it just 
describes what happens but doesn't actually require it.

- The spec requires that the interfaces that the Window object (called 
&quot;DOMWindow&quot; in the spec for some reason) implements depend on the markup 
in the page. This makes no sense, since the markup in the page isn't known 
at the time the interfaces are prepared, and even if they were, the page's 
content can change dynamically with elements being added and removed from 
script randomly.

- Using URLs as intents, especially for the default intents, is overly 
verbose. I highly recommend just having a wiki page be a registry of 
widely used intents, and saying that if people want specialised ones for 
their own communities, they can then use URLs, but otherwise it's fine to 
just use simple identifiers like &quot;edit&quot; or &quot;share&quot;, so long as they are 
registered in the wiki. This is what we're doing with rel=&quot;&quot; and it seems 
to work fine.
