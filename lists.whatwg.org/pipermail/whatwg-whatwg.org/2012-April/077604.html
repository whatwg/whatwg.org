<PRE>Any further input on Kenneth's suggestions?

Re: ArrayBufferView vs. DataView - I'm tempted to make the switch to just
DataView. As discussed below, data parsing/serialization operations will
tend to be associated with DataViews. As Glenn has mentioned elsewhere
recently, it is possible to accidentally do a buffer copy when mis-using
typed array constructors, while DataView avoids this. DataViews are cheap
to construct, and when I'm writing sample code for the proposed API I find
I create throw-away DataViews anyway. Also, there is the potential for
confusion when using a non-Uint8Array buffer e.g. are the elements being
decoded using array[N] as the octets or using the underlying buffer? for
Uint16Array/UTF-16 encodings, what are the endianness concerns? DataView
APIs have an explicit endianness and no index getter, which alleviates this
somewhat.

Re: writing into an existing buffer - as Glenn says, most of the input
earlier in the thread advocated strongly for very simple initial API with
streaming support as the only &quot;fancy&quot; feature beyond the minimal string =
foo.decode(buffer) / buffer = foo.encode(string). Adding details =
foo.encodeInto(string, buffer) later on is not precluded if there is demand.

Also, I am planning to move the &quot;fatal&quot; option from the encode/decode
methods to the TextEncoder/TextDecoder constructors. Objections?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; two use cases in mind: in-memory assembly of data to be sent to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; graphics card or audio device, where the byte order must be that of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec.  It violates the most basic web API requirement: interoperability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please see earlier in the thread; the views affected by endianness need
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be specced as little endian.  That's what everyone is going to implement,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and what everyone's pages are going to depend on, so it's what the spec
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs to say.  Separate types should be added for big-endian (eg.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Int16BEArray).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your input.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The design of the typed array classes was informed by requirements
</I>&gt;<i> about how the OpenGL, and therefore WebGL, API work; and from prior
</I>&gt;<i> experience with the design and implementation of Java's New I/O Buffer
</I>&gt;<i> classes, which suffered from horrible performance pitfalls because of
</I>&gt;<i> a design similar to that which you suggest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Production browsers already implement typed arrays with their current
</I>&gt;<i> semantics. It is not possible to change them and have WebGL continue
</I>&gt;<i> to function. I will go so far as to say that the semantics will not be
</I>&gt;<i> changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the typed array specification, unlike Java's New I/O specification,
</I>&gt;<i> the API was split between two use cases: in-memory data construction
</I>&gt;<i> (for consumption by APIs like WebGL and Web Audio), and file and
</I>&gt;<i> network I/O. The API was carefully designed to avoid roadblocks that
</I>&gt;<i> would prevent maximum performance from being achieved for these use
</I>&gt;<i> cases. Experience has shown that the moment an artificial performance
</I>&gt;<i> barrier is imposed, it becomes impossible to build certain kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> programs. I consider it unacceptable to prevent developers from
</I>&gt;<i> achieving their goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also disagree that it should use DataView.  Views are used to access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrays (including strings) within larger data structures.  DataView is
</I>&gt;<i> used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to access packed data structures, where constructing a view for each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variable in the struct is unwieldy.  It might be useful to have a helper
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DataView, but the core API should work on views.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is one point of view. The true design goal of DataView is to
</I>&gt;<i> supply the primitives for fast file and network input/output, where
</I>&gt;<i> the endianness is explicitly specified in the file format. Converting
</I>&gt;<i> strings to and from binary encodings is obviously an operation
</I>&gt;<i> associated with transfer of data to or from files or the network.
</I>&gt;<i> According to this taxonomy, the string encoding and decoding
</I>&gt;<i> operations should only be associated with DataView, and not the other
</I>&gt;<i> typed array types, which are designed for in-memory data assembly for
</I>&gt;<i> consumption by other hardware on the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  - It would be preferable if the encoding API had a way to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; memory allocation, for example to encode into a passed-in DataView.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was an earlier design, and discussion led to it being removed as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; premature optimization, to simplify the API.  I'd recommend reading the
</I>&gt;<i> rest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do apologize for not being fully caught up on the thread, but hope
</I>&gt;<i> that the input above was still useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
