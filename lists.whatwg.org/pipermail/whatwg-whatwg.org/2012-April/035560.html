That's true. But there are other plausible approaches. There's GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES:

    <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glPixelStore.xml">http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glPixelStore.xml</A>

Or code generation: translate the shaders to do the byte-swapping explicitly in GLSL. For floats you should be able to cast back and forth to ints via intBitsToFloat/floatBitsToInt.

But these days more and more big-endian systems have support for little-endian mode, which is probably the simplest approach. And honestly, there just don't seem to be WebGL-enabled user agents on big-endian systems. We've left a specification hole in a place that's easy to trip over, only out of concern for hypothetical systems -- in an era when little-endian has clearly won.

If the web isn't already de facto little-endian -- and I believe my colleagues have seen evidence that sites are beginning to depend on it -- then typed arrays force developers to test on big-endian systems to make sure their code is portable, when it's quite likely they don't have any big-endian systems to test on. That's a tax on developers they may not be willing or able to pay. I should know, I am one! :)

    <A HREF="https://github.com/dherman/float.js/blob/master/float.js">https://github.com/dherman/float.js/blob/master/float.js</A>

In a hilariously ironic twist of fate, I recently noticed that the endianness-testing logic originally had a stupid bug that made LITTLE_ENDIAN always true. It's now fixed, but I didn't detect the bug because I didn't have a big-endian JS engine to test on.

&gt;<i> Our emails certainly crossed, but please refer to my other email.
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL applications that assemble vertex data for the GPU using typed

</I>
I'm afraid this is wishful thinking. API's have more than a fixed set of use cases. The beautiful thing about platforms is that people invent new uses the designers didn't think of. Typed arrays are simple, powerful, and general-purpose, and people will use them for all kinds of purposes. Take my &quot;float explorer&quot;:

    <A HREF="http://dherman.github.com/float.js/">http://dherman.github.com/float.js/</A>

There's no XHR and no WebGL involved in that code. (And I didn't invent that to make a point here -- I wrote it months ago when I wanted to visualize the bit patterns of floating-point numbers.)

Or imagine writing a crypto algorithm that optimizes bit manipulations by working on int-sized chunks via casts:

    <A HREF="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/arcfour.c#347">http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/arcfour.c#347</A>

If you don't carefully endian-detect, the hashing logic will produce gibberish.

&gt;<i> Once DataView is available everywhere then the top priority should be
</I>&gt;<i> to write educational materials regarding binary I/O. It should be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to educate the web development community about correct
</I>&gt;<i> practices with only a few high profile articles.
</I>
DataView is great and we're working on it in SpiderMonkey, but as I say that won't solve this issue. There are all kinds of possibilities for using typed arrays with casts purely in-memory. Where there's incentive to write unportable code, people will write unportable code. A few articles or tutorials won't change that. That's not a knock against webdevs; it's entirely rational behavior.

We shouldn't tax web developers by forcing them to implement portability logic they can't realistically test, nor should we expect that they will. Particularly when it's only for potential performance problems on hypothetical big-endian user agents. If worse comes to worst, and big-endian browsers crop up with serious performance problems, we can extend the API's to allow an optional boolean bigEndian flag (that defaults to false), and a way to feature-detect the system's native endianness (navigator.isBigEndian or something like that). That way, developers who don't opt in to writing portable logic get *performance degradation* instead of *incorrect behavior*.
