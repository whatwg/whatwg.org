<PRE>Thanks for the spec changes, startDate is now in a state where I'd be  
happy to implement it! More comments inline:

</I>
This makes sense, and the new spec example makes it clearer.

&gt;&gt;<i> It could also do with a good example. The spec says:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;If the media resource specifies an explicit start time and date, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that time and date should be considered the zero point in the media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timeline; the timeline offset will be the time and date, exposed using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the startOffsetTime attribute.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I interpret this as a date at currentTime=0 in the spec's definition of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currentTime
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and currentTime=-initialTime (unless media fragments are used) in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Opera/Firefox definition of currentTime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what this means.
</I>
In current Opera and Firefox the timeline is always normalized to start at  
0, so the time that corresponds to 0 in the original timeline would be at  
a negative currentTime. We will have to change this at the same time as  
implementing startDate, since otherwise everything will be a mess...

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Finally, what about initialTime? It can be set to a non-zero value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at two points in the spec:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Establish the media timeline for the purposes of the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; playback position, the earliest possible position, and the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; playback position, based on the media data.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;If either the media resource or the address of the current media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; resource indicate a particular start time, then set the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; playback position to that time and&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Does any format expose something like this in-band? I don't know of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any that do and how to implement this, so the only thing that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remains is exposing the start time of media fragments. This seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; rather useless to me, so unless someone has already implemented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; initialTime and explain what it means, I suggest dropping it from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the spec.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The address of the current media resource can indicate a particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; start time if you implement media fragments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, but why do we need to expose that in the DOM API, what is the use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allows controllers to trivially implement UI to jump back to where the
</I>&gt;<i> stream started, while still showing the full seekable range.
</I>
Unless I'm missing something, initialTime is just the initial value of  
currentTime, so this is already easy. Also, if media fragments are not  
used, just setting currentTime=0 will clamp and seek to the earliest  
position. However, I've never actually seen such UI for &lt;video&gt;, do you  
have a real world example? It seems to me like this is a &lt;1% use case that  
is already easy to solve and that it's not worth adding an API to go from  
easy to trivial.

</I>
AFAIK, no browser supports any format for &lt;video&gt; that does not have  
timestamps. I don't think there's any practical need to say how to handle  
this until some implementor actually wants to do it, but if you really  
want to I would have been less confused if the lack of &quot;explicit timeline&quot;  
were portrayed as an exception, using something like multipart/x-replace  
as an example.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've updated the second sentence to explicitly state that it also only
</I>&gt;<i> applies in the absence of a timeline.
</I>
Thanks, that's much better!

&gt;&gt;<i> * Why does the spec differentiate between static and streaming resources
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you receive the entire file, there's no complication with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> streaming to a point before the first rendered frame. The distinction is
</I>&gt;<i> not intended to be normatively detectable, it's only intended to
</I>&gt;<i> distinguish the easy case from the harder case. Again, if you think
</I>&gt;<i> there's some way I could clarify that, please let me know.
</I>
IIUC, the spec is trying to handle resources that have no timestamps, are  
not (known to be) finite and where &quot;the user agent will be able to seek to  
an earlier point than the first frame originally provided by the server&quot;,  
i.e. with server-side seeking. Do such resources actually exist? I don't  
see how they could, because how could the server seek without some concept  
of timestamps?

All in all, simply demanding that all formats used have a timeline mapping  
seems like a good way to deal with this, for now at least.

&gt;&gt;<i> These definitions can be tweaked/clarified in one of two ways:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. currentTime always reflects the underlying timestamps, such that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource can start playing at a non-zero offset and seekable.start(0)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be non-zero even for a fully seekable resource. This is what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec already says, modulo the &quot;streaming resources&quot; weirdness.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Always normalize the timeline to start at 0 and end at duration.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that the BBC blog post is favoring option 2, and while that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> closest to our implementation I don't feel strongly about it. A benefit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of option 1 is that currentTime=300 represents the same thing on all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clients, which should solve the syncing problem without involving any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinds of dates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec definitely intends #1 if the format supports it. I don't think  
</I>&gt;<i> #2
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense for many cases (e.g. broadcast TV, any case where you can
</I>&gt;<i> seek to before the first rendered frame), and more importantly, if you
</I>&gt;<i> connect to a stream and then later start discarding earlier data, you end
</I>&gt;<i> up in #1 even if you started in #2 so I see no benefit to going out of  
</I>&gt;<i> our
</I>&gt;<i> way to start in #2.
</I>
I (now) agree, and will try to align Opera with #1 when we poke at this  
next.

&gt;&gt;<i> Make it pedantically clear which of the above two options is correct,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferably with a pretty figure of a timeline with all the values
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearly marked out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be happy to add such a diagram, but I have no idea how to do it,
</I>&gt;<i> given the bazillions of edge cases here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone wants to make such a diagram, I recommend doing it by writing
</I>&gt;<i> code for this tool:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...and then sending me the code. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Ideally, using little parameterised functions for any repeated bits, so
</I>&gt;<i> it's really easy to adjust.)
</I>
Odin, you make some diagrams, do you think any of those could be ported to  
a script?
