</I>&gt;<i> I hope we doesn't need an emergency to fix problems.  Nobody's proposing blocking anything, just providing a better API.  This doesn't impose any requirements on implementations who don't need it; it just makes it possible for those who do.  Those who don't can always block and queue the callback to happen as soon as the script returns to the event loop--doing it better is just QoI.

For the record, I don't object to adding an async version of getImageData, or some alternate means of getting async behavior. I would, however, object to:

- Removing the existing synchronous getImageData (too much compatibility impact at this point)
- Forcing getImageDataHD to only offer an async variant, despite synchronous getImageData existing probably indefinitely

At least the latter has been advocated previously on this thread. It's not clear to me what you are personally advocating, so I cannot tell if I disagree with you.

Regards,
Maciej
