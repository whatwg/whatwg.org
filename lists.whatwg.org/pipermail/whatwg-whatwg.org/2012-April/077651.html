</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I was recently experimenting with the registerProtocolHandler (RPH)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; API and came across a couple of security gotchas that make it hard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; safely use the API. One of these is already known, but AFAICT, hasn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; been fixed yet. I haven't seen the other discussed yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The Mozilla blog post that introduces the registerProtocolHandler API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; makes use of window.parent.postMessage to send a response from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; RPH handler back to the client page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I presume it uses this in conjunction with an &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt; link with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; target=&quot;&quot; attribute to load the handler in an iframe.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The client page loads the handler page using an iframe or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window.open(). Either can work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In the example code, the targetOrigin for this postMessage invocation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is '*', while also noting that this is not secure. AFAICT, there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; no API that the intent handler can reliably use to determine the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; correct targetOrigin for this postMessage invocation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How can the origin be anything other than the origin of the page that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; triggered the link?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Exactly, but we need a way for the handler page to find out what that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> origin is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A client page on origin A causes a navigation to a RPH URL (iframe or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window.open). The browser loads the user chosen RPH handler, which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another web page from origin B. After the handler page loads, it wants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to send a return value back to the client page. How does the handler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page know the client page's origin is A? It needs to know this origin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> string so that it can securely use postMessage to send the return value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back. AFAICT, there is no existing API in the browser that lets the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handler page determine the client page's origin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well if it's an iframe, the parent can't be anything but the original
</I>&gt;<i> origin, as far as I can tell.
</I>
What happens if the handler sends the postMessage to &quot;*&quot;, then the
parent is navigated? Will the postMessage be delivered or not?

&gt;<i> But in general, there's not expected to be any talking back. If you want
</I>&gt;<i> something where the handler talks back to the page that provided the data,
</I>&gt;<i> then you should use Web Intents. registerProtocolHandler() and
</I>&gt;<i> registerContentHandler() are intended for things like mail clients
</I>&gt;<i> (mailto:) or PDF viewers, which do not talk back. Indeed in the common use
</I>&gt;<i> case, you just click the link and the entire browsing context gets
</I>&gt;<i> replaced, so there's nothing to talk back _to_.
</I>
I was prompted to write the original email by a Mozilla blog post that
suggested talking back.

It also seems bad for web APIs to break under simple composition like
this; especially when there's an easy fix available.

&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, the handler page can only specify &quot;*&quot; in the postMessage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invocation that sends the return value. If the client page is navigated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by an attacker, before the postMessage is done, the attacker can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intercept the return value. It's the same rationale used every time we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advise programmers against using '*' as the targetOrigin for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> postMessage() invocation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That rationale only applies when you're going from window to window, not
</I>&gt;<i> when you're going from iframe to parent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The second problem with RPH is that the handler page doesn't have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; way of reliably getting the URL of the content to be handled from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; browser. In order to work in offline scenarios, the RPH handler must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; put the %s placeholder in the fragment of its handler's URL.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It's not clear to me that it makes sense to have an offline protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; handler. What kind of protocol do you have in mind?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, consider an offline web mail program. I click on a mailto:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> link and want to compose a message in my web mail editor, queuing it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be sent next time I'm online.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RPH is a way for a web page to send data to a user determined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application. There will surely be many scenarios where offline
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality is desirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For such an example, you can just use a fallback section in the appcache
</I>&gt;<i> manifest. (Or a fragment identifier, indeed.)
</I>
Right, the obvious thing to do is use the fragment identifier, but
that's got some security problems. With a small tweak we can make this
safe and easy.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, this means that other content in the browser could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; modify the content URL before the handler reads it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Well, any content can load any URL, so it doesn't matter whether the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; URL is in the fragment identifier or the path or anything else,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; surely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It matters if the handler page assumes that the URL came from its parent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or opener. The parent and opener then engage in a postMessage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversation where the parent knows it said one thing, but the handler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heard it saying something different, something chosen by the attacker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would a mail client talk back to its opener?
</I>
It might not, but some RPH handlers will. They've got a postMessage
API; they're going to use it. Let's make sure its possible to use it
safely.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The intent handler sees a request coming from the victim page, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with a content URL specified by the attacker. A related problem is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that the intent handler has no way to distinguish whether its URL was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; loaded via the browser's RPH handling, or whether the client page
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; directly navigated to the intent handler's URL. Both of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; problems could be fixed by adding another readonly DOMString to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; API that contains the %s data for the RPH invocation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand why it matters how the URL was invoked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the URL was invoked via RPH, then the handler page knows that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user selected it for this action. The handler page also knows that any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arguments in the handler's URL (not in the RPH URL), were set by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handler's origin and were not tampered with by the client page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, a web mail program might have two registered RPH handlers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for mailto: &quot;<A HREF="https://example.org/?from=me@company&amp;q=%s">https://example.org/?from=me@company&amp;q=%s</A>&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="https://example.org/?from=me@personal&amp;q=%s">https://example.org/?from=me@personal&amp;q=%s</A>&quot;. The user has configured
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their browser to send mailto links to their personal email editor. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> malicious client page could directly open the URL for the company email
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editor. The web mail editor needs a way to detect when a client page is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to subvert the user's chosen preferences. So, an RPH handler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs a way to know that it was loaded via the RPH dispatch. Once it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knows this, it can also trust that the arguments in the URL, such as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;from&quot; in this case, were not tampered with by the client page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the attack scenario. Sure, a Web page can open another
</I>&gt;<i> Web page with arbitrary arguments. Why does it matter here?
</I>
Two reasons:
1. An RPH dispatch is different from a direct load because it
communicates a user choice to the RPH handler. I explained above how a
handler might use this information.
2. An RPH dispatch comes from the browser, so URL parameters can be
trusted; whereas they cannot be trusted in a load from another web
page.

With a small change, we can prevent a client page from faking an RPH
dispatch to a handler page.
