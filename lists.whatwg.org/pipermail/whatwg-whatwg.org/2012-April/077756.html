&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;&gt; does that and is widely used AFAICT.

</I>&gt;<i> That is true, but adding this to the body seems weird too.
</I>
How bad would that be? Do we expect a lot of breakage? Can't we simply
assume websites would use the programmatic registration if the
declarative one doesn't work/break some old browsers?

I think the fallback is quite useless here.

</I>
Doesn't @accept on &lt;input&gt; allows &quot;image/*&quot;, &quot;video/*&quot;, &quot;audio/*&quot;? We
should at least accept those values.
But maybe it would be safe to allow foo/* if a service and client would
be connected only if they both marked they &quot;foo/*&quot; as a type?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;meta&gt; is also a weird case because we'd basically be reusing the element

</I>
AFAIUI, &lt;link&gt; is far from ideal for what we want.
IMO, &lt;meta&gt; would match quite well our needs. We could put all the
information in @content like &lt;meta name='viewport'&gt; is doing. However,
IIUIC, we can have only one &lt;meta&gt; with a given @name which means a page
will not be able to register declaratively more than one intent.
Otherwise, we could come with a very complex syntax to allow more than
one declaration in @content.

Given that Web Intents would deprecate/supersede RPH and RCH, I wonder
why we should bother incorporating them.

</I>&gt;<i> registered in the wiki. This is what we're doing with rel=&quot;&quot; and it seems

</I>
I fully agree: URLs for common/default intents is a wrong idea.
