</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A follow up about this proposal:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Based on the feedbacks we got on this list we've implemented the following
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> API to do experiments in Chrome:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;DataTransferItem.getAsEntry(in EntryCallback callback)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this actually need to be async? &#160;The only information you need to
</I>&gt;<i> create the Entry are the filename and the file type (file or directory),
</I>&gt;<i> which the browser can load before performing the drop, so no file I/O is
</I>&gt;<i> needed here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which takes a callback that returns FileEntry or DirectoryEntry if it's for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drop event and the item's kind is 'file'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right now it's prefixed therefore its actual name in Chrome is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'webkitGetAsEntry'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We use kind=='file' in a broader definition here (i.e. a file path which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be either regular file or directory file) and didn't add a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind for directories.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Btw we've also implemented DataTransferItem.getAsFile(), so apps can call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either getAsFile or webkitGetAsEntry for kind=='file' item)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If getAsEntry is synchronous, a separate getAsFile method isn't needed.
</I>&gt;<i> You can just say transfer.getAsEntry().file(), and reduce the API surface
</I>&gt;<i> area a bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for lifetime and toURL() issue, which was the biggest concern in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> past discussion, we decided not to support toURL/resolveURL on &#160;Entries for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drag-and-drop, so that it won't leak reference or expose GC period. &#160;A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dragged file can be accessed only while the script has the Entry instance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (as well as we do for File object).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with this. &#160;toURL makes some sense within the sandboxed filesystem,
</I>&gt;<i> but it just doesn't for non-sandboxed use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We eventually aim to support structured cloning of Entries but it's not
</I>&gt;<i> there yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is sort of a separate issue, but it would be nice to eventually get
</I>&gt;<i> full structured cloning support, with support for File/Entry into
</I>&gt;<i> IndexedDB. &#160;That is, let me store an Entry into IndexedDB, so I can later
</I>&gt;<i> restore it and regain access to the file. &#160;For example, if a user grants my
</I>&gt;<i> music player web app access to his MP3 collection, I can store the
</I>&gt;<i> resulting Entry in IndexedDB (or History), and the user can load my web app
</I>&gt;<i> later and start playing music, without having to re-open the directory
</I>&gt;<i> every time. &#160;This needs further thought around user expectations of how
</I>&gt;<i> long access grants last, but hopefully it can be worked out eventually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (We don't need to go into this here; just mentioning it again while it's on
</I>&gt;<i> my mind, so people can be thinking about it.)
</I>
As you point out, persistent access permissions are a big issue, which
I'll leave for another time.
I just wanted to mention that I think that storing an Entry in a
database is a bit odd, since you're not actually storing the file that
it represents, so the data can effectively change or disappear outside
of a transaction.

It might make more sense to store a URL or other locator for the file,
to make it clear that you're storing a reference, not the data itself.
 I suppose that storing an Entry could be like storing a capability
[permission to access the file], but that's for the other discussion.

&gt;<i> As for &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; support I am thinking about adding &quot;AsEntries&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute (so that we do not need to do the automatic recursive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files/directories retrieval when the attribute is specified) and &quot;entries&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> field, but haven't done anything yet. &#160;(Open to further suggestions)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds right, too. &#160;This would make File access from &lt;input&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete. &#160;(File would still avoid at least one asynchronous call for
</I>&gt;<i> non-recursive use cases, though, so people will still use it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;I hope we can get valuable user feedbacks (as well as from yours) based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds good. &#160;Once we've played around with this for a while, we can
</I>&gt;<i> start thinking about how to safely expose write access.
