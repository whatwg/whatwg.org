I'll assume that means it's not delivered, even though postMessage is
a method on a Window, not a Document.

A top-level window is the only context in which you can ask the user
to engage in security-sensitive interaction, like entering a password,
or making a selection that must not be vulnerable to clickjacking.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For such an example, you can just use a fallback section in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; appcache manifest. (Or a fragment identifier, indeed.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right, the obvious thing to do is use the fragment identifier, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's got some security problems. With a small tweak we can make this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> safe and easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the security problem. Could you give a concrete example
</I>&gt;<i> of an attack scenario?
</I>
It is well-understood that URL fragment messaging is vulnerable to
tampering between windows or frames in the browser. Boris already
posted further clarifying this point and you seemed to understand. I
don't know what you're confused about.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Why would a mail client talk back to its opener?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It might not, but some RPH handlers will.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why? What's the use case?
</I>
So, it seems you're arguing that the Mozilla blog post was silly and
developers won't try to solve problems that way. Is that so?

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand the attack scenario. Sure, a Web page can open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; another Web page with arbitrary arguments. Why does it matter here?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Two reasons:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. An RPH dispatch is different from a direct load because it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicates a user choice to the RPH handler. I explained above how a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handler might use this information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how this difference affects the security here.
</I>
Well, perhaps it's not strictly necessary for you to understand it.
It's sufficient to understand that we want to enable offline RPH
handlers, without using a known bad technique like URL fragment
messaging.
