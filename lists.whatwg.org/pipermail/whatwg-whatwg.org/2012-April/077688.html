<PRE>
I just added a bunch of things relating to creating dialogs, popup 
windows, inspectors, marking sections of applications as inert, and 
related features to make it easier to build Web applications in HTML:

 - &lt;dialog&gt;: an element to mark up windows.

 - &lt;dialog&gt;.show(anchor): a way to show a &lt;dialog&gt;, anchored to a specific 
   element on the page.

 - &lt;dialog&gt;.showModal(): a way to make a &lt;dialog&gt; modal.

 - &lt;dialog&gt;.close(returnValue): a way to close a &lt;dialog&gt;.

 - inert=&quot;&quot;: a way to disable an entire subtree, without necessarily 
   making the elements in that subtree appear disabled (e.g. the way that 
   controls behind a modal dialog are &quot;disabled&quot; without appearing that 
   way, in traditional UIs).

 - &lt;dialog oncancel=&quot;&quot;&gt;: called when the user hits Escape on a modal 
   &lt;dialog&gt;, can be cancelled to make the dialog not close.

 - &lt;dialog onclose=&quot;&quot;&gt;: called when the dialog closes.

 - &lt;form method=dialog&gt;: a way to use &lt;form&gt; for completely client-side
   interactions, including form validation, without having to worry about 
   the form submitting. (Until browsers support this, you'll have to also 
   specify something like action=&quot;javascript:void(0)&quot;, unfortunately.)

These features were based on discussions on this list (some of which 
are below), but also on the results of looking for existing use cases, 
some of which are documented on this wiki page:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Dialogs">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Dialogs</A>

The Fullscreen specification, also discussed on this list recently, 
defines some of the features upon which these are built. Thanks to Anne 
and Tantek in particular for working on that spec.

All these issues are avoided by &lt;dialog&gt;'s showModal(), which is 
intrinsically async (all it does is disable the UI on the rest of the 
page).


&gt;<i> I'm not sure &lt;dialog&gt; addresses the same use cases as alert() and 
</I>&gt;<i> confirm() because &lt;dialog&gt; is significantly more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> == Non-modal confirm() ==
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> confirm(&quot;Are you sure you want to order the widget?&quot;, function(result) {
</I>&gt;<i>   if (result)
</I>&gt;<i>     sendOrder();
</I>&gt;<i>   else
</I>&gt;<i>     cancelOrder();
</I>&gt;<i> });
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> == &lt;dialog&gt; ==
</I>
  &lt;dialog id=&quot;orderConfirm&quot;&gt;
   &lt;form method=dialog&gt;
    Are you sure you want to order the widget?
    &lt;input type=button value=&quot;Send&quot; onclick=&quot;sendOrder()&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=button value=&quot;Cancel&quot; onclick=&quot;cancelOrder()&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/dialog&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
   [...]
   document.getElementById('orderConfirm').showModal();
  &lt;/script&gt;

I don't think it's &quot;significantly&quot; more complicated, especially given the 
gains.


&gt;<i> Even after all that, you get a less functional experience in some 
</I>&gt;<i> respects.  For example, on Mac OS X, the Cancel button should be to the 
</I>&gt;<i> left of the Ok button whereas on Windows they should be ordered as in my 
</I>&gt;<i> example (i.e., with Ok to the left of Cancel).
</I>
Well, on Mac you shouldn't have an &quot;Ok&quot; button at all, it should be &quot;Send&quot; 
or some such. So this problem exists with confirm() also.

If we were extending confirm(), that might make sense. However, as Maciej

Indeed. Most of the examples on the wiki page I cite above would be 
non-starters with confirm(), even if we extended it with button labels.


&gt;<i> alert() is mostly only used by either by sites with a low-quality user

</I>&gt;<i> non-production code, will use old-fashioned blocking 
</I>&gt;<i> alert/confirm/prompt. Thus, I am not sure there is really a meaningful 
</I>&gt;<i> audience for the non-blocking editions of these calls.
</I>
Indeed.

Sure, but they couldn't be anchored like &lt;dialog&gt; can, couldn't be styled 
like &lt;dialog&gt; can, etc. Anything but the most basic dialogs requires using 
something more elaborate than these methods, so why not just start with 
the more elaborate solution, especially since it's not that complicated?


&gt;<i> I think people use alert, confirm and prompt in part because they are so

</I>&gt;<i> dialogs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not provide less sucky versions of those common dialogs?
</I>
If they don't care about loss of customization, why do we think they care 
about the other problems?

The modal variant of &lt;dialog&gt; handles this (there's a stack of active 
modal dialogs).

With &lt;dialog&gt; it's not that much code.

</I>
I've introduced an inert=&quot;&quot; attribute that you can use in conjunction with 
otherwise non-modal &lt;dialog&gt;s to make them seem modal with respect to some 
parts of the page but not with respect to others.


&gt;<i> Look at my blog:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://meekostuff.net/blog/">http://meekostuff.net/blog/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the bottom is a simple site menu. If you click on the &quot;contact&quot; link 
</I>&gt;<i> it pops up a dialog with a backdrop that covers the whole page... except 
</I>&gt;<i> for the site menu. The dialog can be hidden by a &quot;close&quot; link in the 
</I>&gt;<i> dialog, OR by clicking the &quot;contact&quot; link again.
</I>
You could do this by putting inert=&quot;&quot; attributes on everything that isn't 
that bottom bar (it affects entire subtrees, so you'd only have to put it 
on the id=main &lt;div&gt;) while the contact dialog was up. You'd still have to 
do the backdrop and z-index positioning yourself though in this case.
