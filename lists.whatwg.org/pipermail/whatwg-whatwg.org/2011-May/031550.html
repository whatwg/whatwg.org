</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt;, to provide a textual alternative to the image.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @alt is fine for images with simple textual equivalents, but some images

</I>&gt;<i> textual form by presenting the data used to generate it in the form of a 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;table&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To fix this, @longdesc was added, which is a link to another page with a 
</I>&gt;<i> longer, and possibly structured, alternative representation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> image. This has several problems, however.  First, data shows that many 
</I>&gt;<i> users of @longdesc don't realize that the value of the attribute should 
</I>&gt;<i> be a link to a page representing the longer description, and instead 
</I>&gt;<i> either point it to the embedding page or the image itself, or just fill 
</I>&gt;<i> it with nonsense.  Second, the fact that the long description is a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate page means that it's possible that the linkage can be broken if 
</I>&gt;<i> the server is reorganized or the url structure of the site is altered, 
</I>&gt;<i> or if the code containing the &lt;img&gt; is copypasted between pages.  Since 
</I>&gt;<i> the long description is not presented at all in all major visual 
</I>&gt;<i> user-agents, a breakage can go a long time before being detected.
</I>
There's also a third problem, which is that this information, if useful to 
people who can't see the image, is usually _also_ useful to people who 
_can_ see the image. As such, the simplest solution is just to provide the 
information right there next to the image.


&gt;<i> 4. Some other elements, such as &lt;object&gt; and &lt;video&gt;, have conceptually 
</I>&gt;<i> similar issues, where they want to present alternative content in case 
</I>&gt;<i> their main content is unusable or unrecognized.  These elements encode 
</I>&gt;<i> the fallback content as direct descendants, hiding them when they're not 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. The &lt;canvas&gt; element's situation is *directly* analogous, as &lt;canvas&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> represents an image, and contains textual/structured alternative content 
</I>&gt;<i> as descendants.  The problems with @longdesc described in #3 are not 
</I>&gt;<i> present in &lt;canvas&gt; - the descendants are clearly alternative content, 
</I>&gt;<i> and travel inline with the element, making them immune to linkrot.
</I>
Actually &lt;canvas&gt;' fallback isn't quite the same as &lt;object&gt;'s: it's still 
active even when the &lt;canvas&gt; is shown. You can tab into the &lt;canvas&gt; 
element's fallback content, screen readers render the fallback while 
letting the user interact with the image, etc. It's not fallback, like 
with &lt;object&gt;, or a description, like with longdesc=&quot;&quot;; it's a layer on 
top of the canvas, that just augments it.


&gt;<i> It thus seems that &lt;canvas&gt; represents a strictly better alternative
</I>&gt;<i> to &lt;img&gt; when structured accessibility fallback content is required,
</I>&gt;<i> except for one problem - &lt;canvas&gt; can only be scripted.
</I>
It's not really fallback at all.


&gt;<i> I suggest that we can retain all the benefits of &lt;canvas&gt; over &lt;img 
</I>&gt;<i> longdesc&gt; while avoiding the above problem by adding an optional @src 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to &lt;canvas&gt;.  If present, the image linked by the attribute is 
</I>&gt;<i> loaded and drawn into the &lt;canvas&gt; automatically, without any script 
</I>&gt;<i> intervention required.  &lt;canvas&gt; would then fire the same events that 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img&gt; currently does and generally expose the same API, in addition to 
</I>&gt;<i> the current canvas API.  It would be used like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;canvas src=&quot;complex-chart.png&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     -data that the chart represents-
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/canvas&gt;
</I>
This seems exactly equivalent to:

   &lt;object data=complex-chart.png&quot;&gt;
     &lt;table&gt;
       -data that the chart represents-
     &lt;/table&gt;
   &lt;/object&gt;

...except that in the former case, the accessibility APIs would be quite 
confused since they would let visually impaired (but not blind) users 
navigate a table that wasn't displayed.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt; doesn't expose image APIs like the 'complete' event.
</I>
Sure it does; it fires a 'load' event once the resource is loaded.

It doesn't have the .complete IDL attribute that HTMLImageElement does, 
but then nor does &lt;canvas&gt;. We could add it to &lt;object&gt; if it's really 
that useful.


&gt;<i> Also, it takes arbitrary content, not just images, so you can't use it 
</I>&gt;<i> to contain user-supplied urls.
</I>
&lt;canvas&gt; doesn't currently take any URLs.

What user-supplied URLs are you expecting to display that have structured 
fallback content? Surely if you can sanitise the fallback you can sanitise 
the URL as well.


&gt;<i> Finally, &lt;object&gt; has bad interactivity behavior - if you drop SVG into 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt;, the SVG will swallow any clicks, while SVG-in-&lt;img&gt; doesn't.
</I>
If you drop SVG into &lt;canvas&gt;, it'll presumably lose any interactivity 
whatsoever, which seems even worse, especially from an accessibility 
point of view. Having said that, surely when using SVG rather than a 
bitmap you'd be better off using SVG's own built-in accessibility features 
rather than having a separate structured fallback solution.


&gt;<i> &lt;canvas&gt; doesn't *yet* expose the image APIs, but it wouldn't cause any 
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts to make it have them.  A canvas without a @src would act just 
</I>&gt;<i> like an &lt;img&gt; without a @src, which I believe is already consistent with 
</I>&gt;<i> how &lt;canvas&gt; works.
</I>
If this problem truly exists, which I'm not convinced it does since I feel 
the far better solution is just to show everyone the structured fallback 
and not call it fallback, then it seems that it would be better to use 
&lt;object&gt; rather than try to overload &lt;canvas&gt; to do double-duty as both a 
direct-mode graphics API and an image embedding feature. If changes are 
needed for &lt;object&gt;, we can make those. I'm not sure any are, though.
