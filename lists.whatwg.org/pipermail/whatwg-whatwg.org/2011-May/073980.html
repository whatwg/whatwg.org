I've added a content attribute to &lt;img&gt;, &lt;video&gt;, and &lt;audio&gt; that makes 
the image or media resource be fetched with CORS And have the origin of 
the page if CORS succeeded.

The attribute is &quot;cross-origin&quot; and it has two allowed values, 
&quot;use-credentials&quot; and &quot;anonymous&quot;. The latter is the default, so you can 
just say &lt;img cross-origin src=&quot;data.png&quot;&gt;.

This is only a first draft, I'm not sure it's perfect. In particular, 
right now cross-origin media is not allowed at all without this attribute 
(this is not a new change, but I'm not sure it's what implementations do). 
Also, right now as specced if you give a local URL that redirects to a 
remote URL, I don't have CORS kick in, even if you specified cross-origin. 
(This is mostly an editorial thing, I'm going to wait for Anne to get back 
and then see if he can help me out with some editorial changes to CORS to 
make it easier to make that work generally.)

Implementation and author experience feedback would be very welcome on 
this.

I haven't exposed this. You can work around it by trying to use the image 
in a canvas, then rereading the canvas, and seeing if you get a security 
error. If there are compelling use cases for that I'd be happy to add an 
API to handle this feature to the DOM though.
