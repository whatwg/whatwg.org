Not quite.  I think Robert handled this in his response to this mail, so 
I'll just stick to following that subthread.

&gt;<i> However, I disagree that this is a) likely to work and b) likely to be less confusing than the alternative.
</I>
Yeah, I think that's where our disagreement lies.

&gt;<i> Of course, one solution to both confusion and incorrect expectations is documentation.  :-)

See what Robert said.  Past performance is no guarantee of future 
behavior, etc, but my hopes are not high.  :(

&gt;&gt;<i> Keep in mind that the &quot;user denies&quot; case is very likely to be a _rare_ case.  The common cases would be &quot;user accepts&quot; and &quot;user defers&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the first statement.   However, I don't expect that &quot;user defers&quot; will actually be that common.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you look at the &quot;Suggested UA Policy&quot; portion of the spec, most cases are either implicitly accepted or denied without user prompting.
</I>
Hmm.  OK, but that does mean that the &quot;user defers&quot; case will probably 
just end up broken if sites never see it...  The only way I see to 
prevent such breakage is to not have rare cases.  Above I was arguing 
that we should merge the rare &quot;user denies&quot; case into the common &quot;user 
defers&quot; case, but if their rarity is reversed I still think they should 
be merged....
