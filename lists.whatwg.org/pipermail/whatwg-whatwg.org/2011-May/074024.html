&gt;<i> WebKit is in the process of implementing Mozilla's proposed Full Screen API
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:FullScreenAPI">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:FullScreenAPI</A>&gt;.  Basic full screen support
</I>&gt;<i> is available in WebKit Nightlies &lt;<A HREF="http://nightly.webkit.org/">http://nightly.webkit.org/</A>&gt; on Mac and
</I>&gt;<i> Windows (other ports are adding support as well), and can be enabled through
</I>&gt;<i> user defaults (WebKitFullScreenEnabled=1).  To test the feasibility of this
</I>&gt;<i> API, we have mapped the full screen button in the default controls in
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;video&gt; elements to this new API.  The webkit-only webkitenterfullscreen()
</I>&gt;<i> method on HTMLMediaElement has also been mapped to this new API.  In so
</I>&gt;<i> doing, we have been able to collect test case results from live websites.
</I>&gt;<i>  In this process, I believe we have uncovered a number of issues with the
</I>&gt;<i> API proposal as it currently stands that I'd like to see addressed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Z-index as the primary means of elevating full screen elements to the
</I>&gt;<i> foreground.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec suggests that a full screen element is given a z-index of BIGNUM
</I>&gt;<i> in order to cause the full screen element to be visible on top of the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of page content.  The spec also notes that  &quot;it is possible for a document
</I>&gt;<i> to position content over an element with the :full-screen pseudo-class, for
</I>&gt;<i> example if the :full-screen element is in a container with z-index not
</I>&gt;<i> 'auto'.&quot;  In our testing, we have found that this caveat causes extreme
</I>&gt;<i> rendering issues on many major video-serving websites, including Vimeo and
</I>&gt;<i> Apple.com.  In order to fix rendering under the new full-screen API to be on
</I>&gt;<i> par with WebKit's existing full-screen support for video elements, we chose
</I>&gt;<i> to add a new pseudo-class and associated style rule to forcibly reset
</I>&gt;<i> z-index styles and other stacking-context styles.  This is of course not
</I>&gt;<i> ideal, and we have only added this fix for full screen video elements.  This
</I>&gt;<i> rendering &quot;quirk&quot; makes it much more difficult for authors to elevate a
</I>&gt;<i> single element to full-screen mode without modifying styles on the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> their page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal: the current API proposal simply recommends a set of CSS styles.
</I>&gt;<i>  The proposal should instead require that no other elements render above the
</I>&gt;<i> current full-screen element and its children, and leave it up to
</I>&gt;<i> implementers to achieve that requirement.  (E.g., WebKit may implement this
</I>&gt;<i> by walking up the ancestors of the full-screen element disabling any styles
</I>&gt;<i> which create stacking contexts.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That does seem more reasonable. A conceptual way to think of it is that the
fullscreen element and all its children get a temporary z-index boost.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Animating into and out of full screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WebKit's current video full-screen support will animate an element between
</I>&gt;<i> its full-screen and non-full-screen states.  This has both security and user
</I>&gt;<i> experience benefits.  However, with the current z-index-based rendering
</I>&gt;<i> technique recommended by the proposed Full Screen API, animating the
</I>&gt;<i> full-screen transition is extremely difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal: The full-screen element should create a new view, separate from
</I>&gt;<i> its parent document's view.  This would allow the UA to resize and animate
</I>&gt;<i> the view separate from the parent document's view. This would also solve
</I>&gt;<i> issue 1 above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not sure what &quot;view&quot; means but I can see what I think are Robert's
issues. The DOM still has to be connected and CSS still has to flow. So if I
have body(a(b(c))) and I fullscreen c then changes to CSS of body, a, and b
should all still effect c even when c is in fullscreen mode. Of course maybe
your idea of &quot;detaching&quot; into a separate view means doesn't imply that other
elements.

I guess conceptually I thought all fullscreen does is (1) make the browser
window fullscreen with no chrome and (2) stretch the fullscreen element to
fill that space. That implies that if I set the background color of the
fullscreen element to rgba(0,0,0,0.5) I can see back to the non-fullscreen
elements behind it.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. &quot;fullscreenchange&quot; events and their targets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current proposal states that a &quot;fullscreenchange&quot; event must be
</I>&gt;<i> dispatched when a document enters or leaves full-screen. Additionally, &quot;when
</I>&gt;<i> the event is dispatched, if the document's current full-screen element is an
</I>&gt;<i> element in the document, then the event target is that element, otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> the event target is the document.&quot;  This has the side effect that, if an
</I>&gt;<i> author adds an event listener for this event to an element, he will get
</I>&gt;<i> notified when an element enters full screen, but never when that element
</I>&gt;<i> exits full-screen (if the current full screen element is cleared, as it
</I>&gt;<i> should be, before the event is dispatched.)  In addition, if the current
</I>&gt;<i> full-screen element is changed while in full screen mode (e.g. by calling
</I>&gt;<i> requestFullScreen() on a different element) then an event will be dispatched
</I>&gt;<i> to only one of the two possible targets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal: split the &quot;fullscreenchange&quot; events into two: &quot;fullscreenentered&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;fullscreenexited&quot; (or some variation thereof) and fire each at the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. A lack of rejection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current proposal provides no notification to authors that a request to
</I>&gt;<i> enter full screen has been denied.  From an UA implementor's perspective, it
</I>&gt;<i> makes writing test cases much more difficult.  From an author's perspective
</I>&gt;<i> it makes failing over to another full screen technique (such as a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;full-window&quot; substitute mode) impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal: add a &quot;fullscreenrequestdenied&quot; event and require it to be
</I>&gt;<i> dispatched when and if the UA denies a full-screen request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
