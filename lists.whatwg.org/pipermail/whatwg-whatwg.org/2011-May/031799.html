&gt;<i> As far as I understand it now, the actual problem here is that we want

</I>

I think part of the confusion is that most of us think of &quot;parsing&quot; in C
terms: a compiler taking the whole chunk and processing the whole thing
before executing any of it.  From what I understand (from the above, and
other vague recollections), V8 only does a very rough first pass, and then
parses code when it's executed, so the amount of &quot;parsing&quot; time that could
be done asynchronously is tiny anyway.

But you can already do that by putting the whole script in
&gt;<i> a comment, for instance, as Gmail does, so I'm not clear at this point
</I>&gt;<i> on why we need another feature in actual browsers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's a gross hack, that they're presumably only doing because they have no
better way.  Isn't that just a workaround for old JS engines on mobile?  I'm
guessing that hack isn't needed on any modern script engine.  See the timing
example I gave earlier: executing a large script block that only defines a
couple functions takes no measurable time.  It also takes no measurable time
(0ms) on the stock browser on my Android 2.3.4 phone (on a Nexus S).

&gt;<i> James points out this doesn't work if you don't control the script at
</I>&gt;<i> all -- e.g., if you're loading a copy of jQuery from a central
</I>&gt;<i> location that serves many sites, in the interest of increasing cache
</I>&gt;<i> hits or offloading bandwidth.
</I>
The same applies to the saner wrap-in-a-function method.  I don't think it
makes sense to introduce new browser features for this, though--it's a whole
lot simpler to get the central location to offer a pre-wrapped version, than
to change every browser so they don't have to.  (&quot;Dye my eyes to match my
dress&quot;, etc...)
