</I>&gt;<i> Limited or no keyboard input also greatly mitigates the risk of a full OS UI spoofing attack. I think there are better ways to address this than prompting the user. For example, for apps requesting full keyboard access, there could be an always-visible onscreen indicator that is not easily covered up. This does not necessarily have to be ugly, or distracting in a game context.

</I>
For example, a distinctive bar across the top of the screen with a button that clearly takes the user out of fullscreen. It could look similar to the menu bar found on Mac OS X or the status bar found on iOS. It could fade after some period of no user interaction, if that would be helpful for cases. Another possibility is a small square in the corner with a close box appearance.

It's true that this would prevent really true full screen for a game. However, it would be more effective at mitigating full OS UI simulation attacks than a confirmation prompt and would be less likely to confuse the user.

I believe also that for a Web app the user has explicitly chosen to &quot;install&quot;, as with the Chrome Web Store, or for the no-keyboard / limited-keyboard case, these kinds of tricks are not even be necessary.

I think not having a full keyboard input mode at all is an option that should be seriously considered. Probably a very small set of keys is sufficient for games.

</I>&gt;<i> That's fine for video, but not for anything interactive. Do you have in mind a generic onscreen indicator that would work well for, say, Quake?
