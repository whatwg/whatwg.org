</I>&gt;<i> There's been some preliminary discussion within the WebGL working group

</I>&gt;<i> with Web Workers in particular. There is a strong desire to support 
</I>&gt;<i> handoff of an ArrayBuffer from the main thread to a worker and vice 
</I>&gt;<i> versa; this would allow efficient producer/consumer queues to be built 
</I>&gt;<i> without violating ECMAScript's shared-nothing semantics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All of the parties involved are pretty busy getting WebGL 1.0 out the

</I>&gt;<i> (2) handoff of ArrayBuffers. Expect public discussions to start in about 
</I>&gt;<i> six to eight weeks.
</I>
Ken and I discussed this off-list, editor-to-editor as it were, and the 
plan is to wait for Typed Arrays to settle down a bit more, and then 
once they are stable, to update the structured clone algorithm to handle 
them directly (so that the Typed Array spec doesn't have to be a delta 
spec to the HTML spec).

I haven't changed CanvasPixelArray.
