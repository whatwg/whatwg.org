Again, I fail to see how this is a problem for the &quot;denial&quot; event but not for the &quot;change&quot; event.

&gt;&gt;<i> That doesn't seem like a confusion about the API, but with Firefox's UI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox's UI simply allows a user to defer the decision.  There's no problem there.
</I>
Right, I'm saying the developer is confused about FIrefox's UI.  He (apparently) expects &quot;Not now&quot; to generate an error.

&gt;<i> All that happened is that the _developer_ (not a user!) got confused about the meaning of &quot;Not Now&quot;.  It really does mean &quot;I haven't decided yet&quot;, not &quot;I'm not sharing&quot;.
</I>
Exactly.  I'm saying it's a UI confusion, and not one that justifies removing the error notification.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't believe that Firefox's UI decisions should justify removing what would otherwise be a useful piece of API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The piece of API is broken, as Chrome's behavior described above shows.  All it's doing is creating incorrect author expectations.
</I>
I strongly disagree.  Firefox's UI behavior is causing confusion, not the API.  This problem is not endemic to the geolocation feature, but rather to one (or two) implementations of that feature.

&gt;&gt;<i> So far, neither you nor Roc have been able to articulate why this event should be omitted beyond vague handwaving about developer confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how &quot;you can't depend on this event ever firing, so you have to code on the assumption that it won't fire, but the spec makes you think that it will fire&quot; can be any clearer.
</I>
I can: by adding an explicit error event.

&gt;&gt;<i> On the contrary, there are real use cases for the denial event:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Failing over to a browser specific full screen mechanism (such as webkit's video element full screen mode)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Removing or disabling the full screen button from a web-app.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - If a web app requested keyboard access, re-requesting with a no-keyboard full screen mode.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - General user feedback
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None of these work if the event can't be expected to fire on any set schedule!
</I>
Sure they can!  Every single one of these can.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And what do they do for the arbitrarily long time before getting any event at all?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Display an indeterminate progress meter? Disable the full screen button?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't seem reasonable, honestly. Once a user clicks that [x] in Chrome, what happens?  They get stuck?
</I>
Stuck?  They're already in full screen purgatory. :)  What would happen if they clicked on the full screen button again?  Would Firefox pop up another notification?

&gt;&gt;<i> To be quite honest, the way Firefox implements this feature seems like a usability nightmare.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's just fine for the users.  The only problem in the geolocation case is that that the way the API is described creates unrealistic expectations on the part of _developers_.
</I>
I don't consider the following to be a &quot;usable&quot; UI:

- User clicks a full screen button
- Content resizes to occupy full window
- Browser pops up a permissions dialog
- User has to click the &quot;Allow&quot; button*
- Window then becomes full screen

* This line is especially egregious.  I can understand asking for permission if the original full screen request did not originate with a mouse click.  Heck, I'm fine with /requiring/ full screen to initiate with a mouse click.  But asking the user to confirm &quot;did you really mean to do this?&quot; for an easily reversable action is poor UI.  If the browser inadvertantly exposes the user's geolocation to a website, that's an action that can never be undone.  The same is not true for the full screen case.

Now, this UI might be necessary in order to fend off unwanted, full-screen, pop-under advertising or phishing attacks.  That doesn't make it good UI, but possibly a minimilaly bad UI.  All I'm saying is that there may be an even less bad UI which would provide the same benefits.

&gt;&gt;<i> Surely there's a way to achieve the security benefits you're hoping for without requiring intentionally obtuse API?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not if we want to allow users to actually take however long they want to make the decision.  Which we do.
</I>

Thtat's fine.  But I still don't agree that this requires there to be no error event when the user eventually does make that decision.
