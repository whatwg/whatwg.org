It's easy to get a user to click in a page so requiring mouse clicks isn't a
lot of protection. The scenario people are worried about is that the user
clicks, the page goes full-screen and initiates some kind of spoofing
attack, the user doesn't realize what is going on and gets phished or
something like that --- and that is irreversible.

For this case, I think probably a better UI would be what Flash has, to
actually go full-screen immediately but temporarily show a message telling
the user they're in fullscreen mode and how to get out. But I still strongly
feel that the API should be constrained so that passive confirmation won't
break sites, in case that turns out to be necessary in the future.
