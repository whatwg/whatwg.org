My plan with the codecs issue here is to let the implementors figure out 
which codecs they want to implement, and then once there's a common set 
across all the implementations, to require that. So I would recommend 
petitioning the implementors if you have particular codec desires. :-)

Doing this would require reimplementing reliable connectivity over UDP. 
Before we introduce that level of complexity, I really think we should 
make sure people are interested in using this API at all.


&gt;<i> Note: I take for granted that some kind of rate control must be added to 
</I>&gt;<i> the PeerConnection's &quot;data UDP media stream&quot;, so allowing large data 
</I>&gt;<i> chunks to be sent would not increase the risk for network congestion.
</I>
I've added a line in the spec about allowing UAs to implement rate 
control in outgoing data.

I'm happy to specify something along these lines if it can be made to work 
within the constraints of Web technologies (e.g. we can't rely on authors 
to handle rare but important situations). The best way to progress on this 
would be to make a concrete proposal, so that we can see what exactly you 
would like browsers to implement here.


There were also a number of additional e-mails sent over the past month or 
so on PeerConnection and its related APIs, but all these threads seemed to 
resolve themselves without needing any specification changes, so I have 
not explicitly replied to them. If you would like a specific reply to a 
particular comment, please let me know (either on the list of privately) 
and I'll be happy to take another look and reply.
