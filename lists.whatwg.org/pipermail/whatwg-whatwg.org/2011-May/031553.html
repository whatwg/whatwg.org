To summarise this thread:

WebGL has the unfortunate problem of being likely to run into hardware 
limitations more often that most other features, due to limited GPU
resources. Authors need to be able to distinguish the temporary failure of 
a context not being immediately available from the permanent failure of 3D 
not being supported on the system at all.

I think the proposal below handles this well already, with the HTML 
specification as it stands today. I'm happy to add more editorial text to 
the specification discussing this issue if that would help.

This seems like the best way to go for any temporary error situation.


&gt;<i> To sum up, in general I think that whenever getContext(&quot;webgl&quot;) returns

Agreed.

Right.

Seems reasonable.

Sounds good.

Indeed. I've updated the spec to mention this explicitly.


&gt;<i> For transient errors, eg. too many open contexts, return a WebGL context 
</I>&gt;<i> in the &quot;lost&quot; state as Kenneth described.

Indeed.


&gt;<i> It was mentioned that the GPU blacklist can change as the browser runs.

Right.

This is something the browser should do directly. I don't think pages 
should be doing this, otherwise every page will have to reimplement the 
same error reporting logic.

It seems bad to have two modes here. Are there really

It's partly a security issue and partly a privacy issue.

It's a security issue because it discloses to an attacker that the user's 
video drivers can be attacked. How much information we disclose depends on 
how useful this is, but it is always going to be useful to some extent, 
because it gives an attacker somewhere to start, or tells the attacker to 
concentrate on another area.

It's a privacy issue because it increases the fingerprintability of the 
user. How bad this is depends on how many bits of information we return, 
but at a minimum it provides one bit: has a bad driver vs does not.


&gt;<i> First, there would be no way to issue work to the GPU to exploit any 
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities that might exist, since the app couldn't get a 
</I>&gt;<i> WebGLRenderingContext.
</I>
That assumes the attacker has no other way to get the user to use 3D. One 
might well imagine scenarios in which an attacker could use the 
information to try to social-engineer the victim into running software 
that usse 3D (e.g. a game that they own) in a way that they can abuse 
(e.g. because the game renders custom models or some such).

I agree that this is a minor threat. The question is how much benefit do 
users get from having each page be able to provide a custom message 
regarding the video card being blacklisted, instead of having the browser 
provide that message, vs how much risk is the user taking by us exposing 
that information to the page.
