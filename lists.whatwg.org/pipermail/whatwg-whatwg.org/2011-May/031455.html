(This thread started talking about the text field selection API, but 
several posts discussed changes to the range API instead, apparently due 
to some miscommunication. I have ignored the posts that referred to the 
range API. I recommend following up with the editor(s) of the DOM Range 
spec if changes are desired to that spec.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to propose a minor addition to 4.10.20 APIs for the text field 
</I>&gt;<i> selections. When programmatically setting the selection of a text input, 
</I>&gt;<i> it is currently impossible to create a range with the 'anchor' at the 
</I>&gt;<i> bottom and the 'base' at the top. Concretely, this means that, after a 
</I>&gt;<i> selection has been set by a program, if the user presses shift and moves 
</I>&gt;<i> the cursor, it is always the bottom of the selection that is moved. When 
</I>&gt;<i> doing heavy scripting on such input element, it is often necessary to 
</I>&gt;<i> restore a previous selection exactly as the user made it. This is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently not possible, and I'd say the HTML5 standard is our only hope 
</I>&gt;<i> of finally getting something like this widely implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most obvious way to handle this would be to allow selectionStart to 
</I>&gt;<i> be greater than selectionEnd. This is, however, unacceptable for various 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons -- it's not easily feature-detectable, it breaks older code that 
</I>&gt;<i> reads these properties and expects start to never be greater than end, 
</I>&gt;<i> and it makes the names more confusing than they have to be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I propose a selectionAnchor property, which holds either &quot;top&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bottom&quot;, and can be set to one of these strings to modify the 
</I>&gt;<i> direction. &quot;top&quot; would mean the anchor lies after the base of the 
</I>&gt;<i> selection, so further shift-movement modifies the bottom, whereas 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;botton&quot; means the inverse, with movement modifying the top. (I think 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;top&quot;/&quot;bottom&quot; terminology shouldn't break with any languages that 
</I>&gt;<i> order characters differently. Does anyone write bottom to top? If 
</I>&gt;<i> someone sees a problem, we could choose other terms, but these are the 
</I>&gt;<i> most obvious I could come up with.)

I've added selectionDirection = 'forward'/'backward'/'none'. ('none' is 
the default selection direction on Mac OS.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we just have a boolean, it's unambiguous: the properties are all

</I>
These proposals seem more complicated than necessary.

</I>
Having an API that directly addresses the use case seems better, but it's 
unclear how to do it in this case, since the direction has to &quot;move&quot; to 
take into account changes to the text. So I haven't gone this route.
