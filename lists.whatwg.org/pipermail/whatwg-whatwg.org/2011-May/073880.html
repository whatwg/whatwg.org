</I>
If full-screen is limited to being initiated by a user event, and has a visible transition, that significantly diminishes the possibility of effective spoofing. I would say it is better to entirely disallow non-user-initiated fullscreen than to prompt about it.

Limited or no keyboard input also greatly mitigates the risk of a full OS UI spoofing attack. I think there are better ways to address this than prompting the user. For example, for apps requesting full keyboard access, there could be an always-visible onscreen indicator that is not easily covered up. This does not necessarily have to be ugly, or distracting in a game context. Another possibility is to have the indicator appear on mouse move. I think these are more sensible and pleasant mitigations than a user prompt. And possibly also more effective. If the user can be confused about what state the OS is in after clicking something and then seeing a visible transition (perhaps followed by a faked version of the browser crashing and the OS popping up some password dialog), then they could quite possibly also be fooled if they first clicked on a &quot;cancel or allow&quot; prompt.

Note that for the non-keyboard / limited keyboard case (likely the common case for video players), the full-OS spoof phishing attack is not even much of a threat in the first place, so prompting in that case just promotes confirmation fatigue with no real benefit.

If we could take prompting the user off the table in the range of UIs we are considering, it would allow us to significantly simplify both the API and the user interface for this feature. So I hope we can consider this. I'm not sure extensions like NoScript alone are sufficient reason to impose the additional complexity required by a user prompting model. After all, the API for running a script doesn't involve an asynchronous request model, yet NoScript somehow manages to do its thing.

Maciej
