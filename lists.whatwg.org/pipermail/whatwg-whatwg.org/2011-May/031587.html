Of course.  I was really only talking about explicit user deferral actions; there might not be a good way to solve the problem of &quot;ignoring the notification&quot;.  If it's anything like the current Firefox Geolocation notification, wouldn't a click in the non-popup area dismiss the notification?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I'd argue that the case where a page author would have to wait any appreciable amount of time before receiving a &quot;fullscreendenied&quot; event is actually quite rare.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For what my sample size of one is worth, when Firefox pops up its passive &quot;This Web page tried to open a popup window&quot; UI, I usually ignore it rather than dismiss it.

</I>&gt;<i> Interesting.  Does Firefox display that message for non-user-action driven pop-ups?  Or are those blocked silently?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It displays that message for non-user-action driven pop-ups. Popups in mouse click events are automatically allowed (and open a new tab).
</I>
Okay.  Assuming Firefox adopts the &quot;Suggested UA Policy&quot; portion of the API, equivalent full-screen window requests would be implicitly denied, so you would hopefully not be spammed by full-screen request notifications quite as frequently.
