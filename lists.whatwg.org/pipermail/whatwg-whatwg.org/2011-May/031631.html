</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This proposition is mostly trying to fix a user experience issue: when 
</I>&gt;<i> you have to type a text limited to a given number of characters and at 
</I>&gt;<i> some point you just can't type anymore because you reached this limit,

</I>
True.


&gt;<i> It seems much more interesting to use the constraint validation 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism we already have to tell the user that the text is actually 
</I>&gt;<i> limited to X characters. With that system, the user will be able to type 
</I>&gt;<i> it's entire text and then easily reduce it to the desired size. Think 
</I>&gt;<i> about how annoying twitter.com would be if the users were not able to 
</I>&gt;<i> type when the text field has reached 140 characters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Though, this might not be really helpful for text field which aren't 
</I>&gt;<i> expecting a long text. If this is an issue, maybe we could go for 
</I>&gt;<i> Aryeh's suggestion for &lt;input&gt; [1] and do that one for &lt;textarea&gt; only? 
</I>&gt;<i> But it might be confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] UA shouldn't allow the the text length to be greater than the 
</I>&gt;<i> maxlength value (and assume that the element can't suffer from being too 
</I>&gt;<i> long).
</I>
Ok. So basically the proposal here is to change the spec so that instead 
of checking the &quot;dirty value flag&quot; to decide whether an element is 
&quot;suffering from being too long&quot;, we check to see if the last edit was done 
by the user, right?

Maxlength is defined in terms of Unicode codepoints, but the UA is allowed 
to let the user type in more text than the max length.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that for something like &lt;input name=tweet maxlength=140&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers currently prevent you from ever entering more than 140

</I>&gt;<i> To address this problem we're planning on making Firefox allow the user

</I>
That makes sense.

The compat bugs are just caused by scripts adding characters, basically. 
So if we limit it just to user-dirty that solves the problems.

I've updated the spec accordingly.
