</I>&gt;<i> Proposal
</I>&gt;<i> Add two apis to window.external:
</I>&gt;<i>   IsSearchProviderInstalled
</I>&gt;<i>   AddSearchProvider
</I>
These appear to be implemented by IE, Chrome (partly on Windows only), and 
Firefox (though IsSearchProviderInstalled is stubbed only).


&gt;<i> IsSearchProviderInstalled(string url) returns
</I>&gt;<i>   * 2 if the origin in the given url is the default search provider
</I>&gt;<i>   * 1 if the origin in the given url is a search provider but not the
</I>&gt;<i> default.
</I>&gt;<i>   * 0 otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> If the given url doesn&#146;t have the same security origin as the page, this api
</I>&gt;<i> throws an access denied exception. (This makes the url redundant but it is
</I>&gt;<i> kept to be consistent with the method exposed by IE 7.)
</I>
I have specified this, except instead of throwing an exception it returns 
0. This means that stubbing out this method is easy and doesn't require 
complicated origin checks to be compatible with full implementations.


&gt;<i> AddSearchProvider(string openSearchUrl, [optional] bool asDefault) 
</I>&gt;<i> retrieves the open search document from openSearchUrl and decides in a 
</I>&gt;<i> UA specific manner whether to prompt the user about the change or 
</I>&gt;<i> addition.
</I>
I haven't specified the &quot;asDefault&quot; argument since it isn't implemented 
anywhere except Chrome, but other than that I have specified it. The UI is 
left very open-ended. Note that there is already an equivalent declarative 
feature in HTML: &lt;link rel=search&gt;.

It's mitigated to some extent by being limited to same-domain checks (you 
can't check if someone has made another search engine their default), 
since frankly if you've made a particular search engine your default they 
can already tell pretty easily just by looking at your usage, if they 
really wanted to violate your privacy.

However, I have made sure to allow UAs to lie and always return 0.


&gt;<i> Developing an discoverable UI that'll be consistent between pages seems 
</I>&gt;<i> more important than implementing an API and using complicated heuristics 
</I>&gt;<i> so that it'll hopefully &quot;seem&quot; not be abused &quot;significantly&quot;.
</I>
I've left the UI entirely open.

</I>
I agree that a good UA would make this easy and consistent.


&gt;<i> Why not just have a &lt;link rel=search href=#search&gt;&lt;form
</I>&gt;<i> id=search&gt;&lt;input type=text&gt;&lt;/form&gt;?
</I>
I'm not sure I understand how this would work. Can you elaborate?

Indeed.

This seems reasonable, indeed.

True.
