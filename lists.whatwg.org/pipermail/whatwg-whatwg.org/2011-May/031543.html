Modifying JS to include them would make no difference, in practice. For 
example, parseInt() is on window, as is Object, String, indeed everything 
is on window. Window is the global object.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>
We try to do that (but with far less verbosity) already. For example, the 
ApplicationCache API is not on Window, you have to get a handle to it:

   &lt;script&gt;
   var my_appcache = window.applicationCache;
   // now you can use my_appcache
   &lt;/script&gt;

As a shorthand, you can also just directly access things on 
applicationCache:

   window.applicationCache.status

The same applies to many other features, e.g. session history features are 
accessed via window.history, features relating to the UA and the 
environment as accessed through window.navigator, etc.


&gt;<i> Further, in CommonJS, the library has to export an object in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> make it available. If we could define things in such a way that the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser compiled the library independent of the page that loads it, the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser could cache the *compiled* code and provide that to the browser 
</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>
That kind of thing has been tried in the past, but in practice it turns 
out there are too many versions of too many libraries to actually make 
this workable, as I understand it.

In this case, yes.

</I>
Window is just the global object. Things that have no meaningful 
connection to anything go on window because there's nowhere else to put 
them (&quot;require()&quot; would have to go on window too). I wouldn't get too 
caught up in the name &quot;window&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; What problem does this solve?  The problem of global namespace 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pollution?  Why not just define window.html (or some other single 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name) and make all the functions methods of that object?  This is kind 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of what we're doing already, although not so systematically.  Your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution seems overly complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could collect them into a single global object, and that was something I
</I>&gt;<i> though about, as well. But I think that this is a more generally applicable
</I>&gt;<i> solution. There are many libraries that do nothing but load javascript from

</I>&gt;<i> believe this is a code smell. Having a consistent way to do this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> thing would improve the lives of a lot of code developers and create some
</I>&gt;<i> consistency between what is happening on the server side as well.
</I>
I don't really understand what problem you are describing here.

My understanding is that this is being addressed in JS itself.


&gt;<i> (Also, just because WhatWG may verify names are fairly unique or unique

</I>&gt;<i> and for which there could be conflicts; abdicating responsibility for

</I>
I think our first priority must be to the Web. If we try to make HTML 
appropriate for multiple different unrelated platforms, we will end up 
pulled in multiple directions. Naturally if there are multiple equally 
good ways to design a solution for a problem faced by the Web, we should 
pick the solutions that work for the most other environments as well, but 
that's not as strong a commitment as I think you are describing above.
