(Note that the WebSockets protocol is being developed by Ian Fette in the 
context of the HyBi working group at the IETF, and not by the WHATWG. The 
discussion here is limited just to API issues.)

</I>
While it's true that tasks for those events might get queued before the 
listeners are attached, it doesn't actually matter, because so long as the 
script attackes the listeners before the event loop next spins, the events 
will not be dispatched before the listeners are attached.

In other words, so long as you hook the events in the same script as you 
create the object, you're fine.


&gt;<i> Is there a reason not to have a separate open() call?
</I>
There's always a reason not to have separate calls: the less API surface, 
the simpler the API, the simpler the implementations, the simpler the 
testing, the smaller the attack surface, the fewer the potential number of 
bugs, and so forth.

It's not magic, it's the event loop. The spec is entirely thorough about 
it already. Follow the links for &quot;queue a task&quot; and related terms.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/#feedback-from-the-protocol">http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/#feedback-from-the-protocol</A> For every 
</I>&gt;<i> event in that section, the user-agent must queue a task to fire the 
</I>&gt;<i> event. None of the other sections describe any events.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me see if I follow the &quot;perfectly clear&quot; line of reasoning you are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using. Your assumption is that a Websocket connection will only be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loaded in an event handler like window.onload.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In HTML5-compliant user-agents, all Javascript runs in some task of the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 event loop. That task must run to completion before other tasks 
</I>&gt;<i> queued by the user-agent will run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No other events will be delivered until the current event handler 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finishes. And the event handler that creates the Websocket object will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessarily also be where the event handlers are set on the Websocket 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object. By making all of these assumptions, it becomes obvious that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within a browser this API is safe for callbacks. Do I have that right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. You observe correctly that the Web author has to be careful to 
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that the event handlers are set on the Websocket object during 
</I>&gt;<i> the same task that created it. However, this is a fairly natural 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement that is common in the Web platform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am reminded of a joke about mathematicians. One argues that it is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obvious that claim A follows from B. The other disagrees. After 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arguing for an hour, the latter finally agrees that A obviously 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; follows from B.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah :-). By &quot;perfectly clear&quot; I meant that the spec was &quot;unambiguous&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than &quot;obvious to the casual reader&quot; :-).
</I>
It may be helpful to read the full WHATWG spec rather than the smaller W3C 
one, as the cross-references are easier to follow in the WHATWG spec:

Done.

Yes, WebSockets is based on TCP.

I recommend bringing this up with the hybi group.


&gt;<i> In a recent posting to my blog, Ruminations, I suggested that the

</I>
That's rather the opposite direction than I would recommend (I'd merge the 
protocol and API back into one spec, personally, and merge that with the 
rest of HTML while we're at it...), but it's up to the hybi group at this 
point.
