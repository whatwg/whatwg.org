The word &quot;dragzone&quot; doesn't appear in the spec anymore so hopefully this 
was addressed already.

</I>
In theory, yes.


&gt;<i> If I understand correctly, the dropzone attribute means that we no 
</I>&gt;<i> longer *have* to write dragenter and dragleave handlers.  But every 
</I>&gt;<i> useful dropzone I've seen in practice provides some kind of feedback 
</I>&gt;<i> (changes background color, e.g.) when it is &quot;armed&quot; and ready to accept 
</I>&gt;<i> a drop.  Is there any mechanism for doing this?
</I>
Not yet, but we should add CSS selectors for this kind of thing. I 
encourage you to approach the CSS working group with suggestions for 
enabling the styling of drag-and-drop interfaces.

Specific needs are:

 - some way to be able to match an element that is being dragged over.

 - some way to be able to animate an element as it goes into and out of 
   this state (CSS transitions?), e.g. to be able to animate something
   &quot;getting out of the way&quot; to let you drop an item between others.

 - as an extension to the previous feature, a way to distinguish being 
   dragged above or to the left of the drag target vs below or to the 
   right of the drag target.

One pseudo-class with an argument should be able to handle that, say 
:<i>drop-target, :drop-target(before), :drop-target(after).
</I>
If CSS can be so updated, I'd be happy to integrate with this in HTML.

The Clipboard API and Events specification hopefully addresses this use

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this contravenes the spec, except that for all of those

</I>&gt;<i> it. &#160;The spec doesn't really mandate anything that you have to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> any specific types of data on the clipboard, which especially makes 
</I>&gt;<i> sense when considering data that originates outside the browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has one interesting implication though for data that originates
</I>&gt;<i> inside the browser: drag/drop or paste with images loaded from data
</I>&gt;<i> URIs. &#160;Currently, the clipboard behavior of these is interesting but
</I>&gt;<i> varies:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Chrome will return an img tag with the data uri intact, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> Base64-encoded data for type &quot;text/html&quot; (preceded by a meta tag telling 
</I>&gt;<i> you you're getting html)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Firefox does pretty much the same thing, minus the meta tag
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Safari doesn't present a &quot;text/html&quot; type in this case. &#160;However, it 
</I>&gt;<i> does provide a &quot;text/plain&quot;, which contains *just* the data uri itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this situation isn't preventing anyone from doing anything, as far 
</I>&gt;<i> as I can tell, but would it be crazy to try to normalize this in the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 spec?
</I>
I don't think it would be crazy. Ambitious, maybe. :-)

The one type it seems you would really want is image/png. I don't see that 
in any of the lists above. The place to start, then, might be in seeing if 
the browser vendors would be willing to implement that; if they are, it 
makes defining a common subset of what they do that much easier.

However, as you say in your e-mail (not quoted here), maybe the better 
solution is to focus on the newer aspects of the DND API.


&gt;<i> Briefly, it looks to me like the use cases were more thought out here 
</I>&gt;<i> for interacting with system drag-drop than with copy-paste. &#160;Excuse me 
</I>&gt;<i> if that isn't the case, and the idea of richer copy-paste was just 
</I>&gt;<i> considered to be out of scope.
</I>
It is definitely the case that D&amp;D was the focus here. However, it should 
work fine with C&amp;P too; the models are more or less equivalent.


&gt;<i> According to the spec, with this API implemented, there will be no way 
</I>&gt;<i> to copy an image from a tab, and paste it into another tab (assuming the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser itself doesn't do something crazy like...bounce the system 
</I>&gt;<i> clipboard to a temporary file on paste and give you the filename 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere). &#160;The DataTransferItem can be of two kinds: a string, or a 
</I>&gt;<i> string referring to a file, so this lets you drag String-y data off your 
</I>&gt;<i> system and into a tab, and it also lets you presumably use Drag/Drop 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the system's file browser to attach files.
</I>
You can also get a File object (which is a superset of Blob with a 
filename). In due course we'll add Blob support too.

</I>
The spec actually has a getAsBlob(), it's just commented out (search the 
source file for DND-v3). If you want to implement it, I can put it in, 
it's all ready already.

</I>
Also commented out is an API for copying and dragging promises rather than 
complete files, which addresses this async issue. I haven't put it in yet 
because we're still waiting for the basics of the new API features to be 
supported. One thing at a time.
