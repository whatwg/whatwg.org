</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I hit this problem in a UI I worked on.  It rendered into a canvas

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At 100% full page zoom this works well.  At 120% zoom, it creates a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; canvas smaller than the window, which is then scaled back up by the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; browser, resulting in a blurry image.  Full page zoom should work on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the UI around it--I didn't want to disable it entirely--but the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; canvas itself should be created in display pixels, rather than CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pixels.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I didn't find any reasonable workaround.  All I can do is tell 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people not to use full-page zoom.  Many users probably see a blurry 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; image and don't know why, since there's no way to detect full-page 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; zoom in most browsers to even hint the user about the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's a bug in the browser. If it knows it's going to be zooming up 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the canvas when it creates the backing store, it should be using a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bigger backing store.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you're saying that, if the user's full-page zoom level is 
</I>&gt;<i> 110% and the page requests a 100x100 canvas, the browser should create a 
</I>&gt;<i> 110x110 backing store instead.  There are several problems with that:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The full-zoom level can be changed by the user after the canvas is 
</I>&gt;<i> already rendered.  If I load a page at 100%, the canvas renders at that 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution, and then I change the full-zoom level to 110%, there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> way for the browser to know this and use a bigger backing store in 
</I>&gt;<i> advance.
</I>
Sure, this is a &quot;best-effort&quot; kind of thing.


&gt;<i> - The data would have to be downscaled to the exposed 100x100 resolution
</I>&gt;<i> when exported with ImageData.
</I>
No, ImageData exposes the underlying data, not the data in CSS pixels.


&gt;<i> Similarly, rendering a 100x100 image into a canvas set to 100x100 would 
</I>&gt;<i> upscale the image, blurring it: the developer should be able to expect 
</I>&gt;<i> that blitting a 100x100 image into a 100x100 canvas will be a 1:1 copy.
</I>
It would make no difference since the canvas is zoomed 110% anyway.


&gt;<i> - If, rather than displaying it in the document at the full-zoom level, 
</I>&gt;<i> the data is sent to the server, the results would be blurry.  For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, if I create a 1000x1000 canvas (and the browser's backing store 
</I>&gt;<i> is actually 1100x1100), and I send the finished data to the server (at 
</I>&gt;<i> the exposed 1000x1000), the browser has to resample the final image, 
</I>&gt;<i> blurring it.
</I>
Yup. If you want to do graphics and know the resolution of the backing 
store, doing it on the client is a poor path. You don't know what 
resolution the image you get back will be in.


&gt;<i> &gt; I went to books.google.com, opened up the first book in my library, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and zoomed in, and it reflowed and rerendered the text to be quite 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; crisp. I don't see any problem here. Images were similiarly handled 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beautifully.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you elaborate on the steps to reproduce this problem?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I tried this, and text was blurry even when I zoomed using only that 
</I>&gt;<i> page's built-in zoom mechanism; it seemed to be scaling the rendered 
</I>&gt;<i> page and not rerendering text at all.  I figured some books might not be 
</I>&gt;<i> OCR'd so I tried another couple books, but it still happened; then it 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow crashed FF3, so I gave up.)
</I>
Weird.
