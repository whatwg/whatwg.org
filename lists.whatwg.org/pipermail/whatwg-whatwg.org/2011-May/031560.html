</I>Yes, you can use TextMetrics. So why have this added bloat?

Most of your philosophy regarding the Canvas API has been to keep out 
unnecessary
and unimplemented items. I don't see how this one is any different.

If it were intended, to be more useful, I'd want to see it in 
measureText as well,
so that measureText('string', maxWidth) would return a font size attribute.

In doing so, I could check to see if the font size is within appropriate 
range
for legibility.

Your use case, in your data chart, could quite easily have been written 
up without
the added attribute. That's why I'm bringing this up.

maxWidth doesn't flow with other judgments and reasoning put forward 
about the canvas spec,
it's not commonly implemented. It's superfluous; easily programmed. And 
it's not exposed in TextMetrics, making it difficult
to test for legibility.
