Cool!

&gt;<i> Basically you want to send slides (via websocket or comet) and sync with

</I>
Yes. My old system (early Errantia) did that, using comet.

&gt;<i> Here is the mistake. Sending Slides in real time has no use. Please
</I>&gt;<i> do not take me wrong. Basically in almost any conference or workshop,
</I>&gt;<i> presenter already has slides ready. So if something is ready then you can

</I>
You misunderstand :-) The slides are no problem at all, I upload them
to the server, then when done it sends a Comet PUSH to the clients
which tells them, a new slide resides at  &quot;&quot;&quot;
<A HREF="http://example.com/images/test-conference/14.jpg">http://example.com/images/test-conference/14.jpg</A> &quot;&quot;&quot;. So that part is
working swell.

Also, I send the time when the slide appeared. However, the syncing to
the video/audio is the impossible part, because there's no way for the
browser to know where the video is in time/place **in a live
setting**, you can very easily do this with archived video, it's just
to read currentTime.

We had a discussion about this, and that was why startOffsetTime made
it into the spec:

<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-May/thread.html#26342">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-May/thread.html#26342</A>



As you see, there are lots of buffering of video. And such, different
people will be different places in the real time video.

So I'm watching &quot;live&quot; and that's only one minute &quot;off&quot;, whilst a
friend is watching via wireless internet and is a full 10 minutes off
because of his buffering etc, etc.

In order to sync slides to the video/audio in such places (when people
connect 10 minutes into the video and get a new currentTime = 0 at
that time), you need a static reference point, but as of now; all time
is still relative. Getting startOffsetTime will get us a static time
to know when we're going to show the new slides (which will also have
a  datetime  field for syncing).

&gt;<i> So , No need to send slides in real time.. Send all slides at once.. and
</I>&gt;<i> then keep on sending the configurations
</I>&gt;<i> I will also try to work on this...
</I>
Well, for some conferences this won't work, and I already have code to
do that live, so I don't need to send slides afterwards. Anyway, both
ways work. But you need to know where people are in the video in order
to sync to the slides; and that's where startOffsetTime come in.

Alternatively you might try to control the buffers/caches, but that's
not always possible. I've tried before, and can't really get it thight
enough, there's too many variables, and Icecast might not be able to
tweak itself to make a really good low latency low buffering live
sending.
