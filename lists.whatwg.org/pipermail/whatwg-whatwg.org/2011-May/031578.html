</I>
I've added toBlob(). However, I made it asynchronous, so that it doesn't 
block while generating the Blob.

That seems a bit more verbose than necessary. I've gone with:

   canvas.toBlob(function(result) { blob = result; });


&gt;<i> This allows browsers to optionally thread compression or (more likely)

</I>&gt;<i> to be supported later on, useful when compressing large images (which 
</I>&gt;<i> may take several seconds).
</I>
It's true that on the long term if we want to expose progress events the 
more verbose API would be more useful, but if we ever decide that's an 
important use case to consider, we can always make the method return an 
object on which progress events get fired.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming that Blob.size is here to stay, web developers are just going

</I>&gt;<i> optimize, for example, by encoding on a background thread and simply 
</I>&gt;<i> blocking inside a size call when the encoding has not completed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main drawback of making it asynchronous is that (AIUI, please 
</I>&gt;<i> correct me if I'm wrong) everything else about the canvas element and 
</I>&gt;<i> the 2d rendering context is synchronous.  This adds cognitive overhead 
</I>&gt;<i> both for developers and actual code complexity for implementations.  
</I>&gt;<i> I'll assert, however, that the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; complexities of 
</I>&gt;<i> presenting an asynchronous API for getting a blob and presenting a 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous API that performs the optimization above are the same.  In 
</I>&gt;<i> particular, in both cases the UA must handle:modifications to the canvas 
</I>&gt;<i> after the Blob Getting API is called. Given this, and that providing an 
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous API to get an object that is supposed to be inherently 
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous seems silly, I would prefer the synchronous version here.

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I think the current Blob and File interfaces are here to stay. Not

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, we could possibly come up with something like a UnsizedBlob

</I>&gt;<i> All functions that currently take Blob should be changed to take

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless we can come up with other APIs where a UnsizedBlob would make

</I>
That's what I've gone with.
