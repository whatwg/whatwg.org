<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I think there's a valid use case for downloading a script and not

</I>&gt;<i> I think we all agree on that.

Boris-
I wish that were true, at this point, but I'm not sure that it is. The tone 
I got from Ian's post (and even subsequent replies) was that he in fact does 
not see this as a valid use-case that we're asking to solve.

And I don't think he's the only one who still doesn't see the value.

If the conversation continues to devolve into rabbit trails about who 
processes what code on which thread in which UA implementation, we will keep 
missing the overall point, which is that authors want and need to download 
code at different times than that code executes, and they can't just freely 
self-host and modify that code to accomplish that -- they must have a more 
flexible loading mechanism that gives them the ability to separate loading 
from execution.

All other bikeshedding about performance nuances aside, this use-case 
remains valid and is unsolvable with unmodified scripts on today's web, 
without sub-optimal hacks like &quot;cache preloading&quot;.
