The change was backwards-compatible with the previous state of the spec, 
so nothing would break if it was working before. However, if browsers 
didn't enforce the same-origin check before for &lt;video&gt;, then yes, if 
they implemented it now things would break.

I've changed this so that &lt;video&gt; now works like &lt;img&gt;; it doesn't send an 
Origin: header by default, taints cross-origin videos but doesn't block 
them, and supports the attribute the same way. &lt;track&gt; (the element for 
text tracks) doesn't do the tainting thing, it either allows or disallows, 
and is controlled by the &lt;video&gt; element's cross-origin=&quot;&quot; attribute, so 
that you don't have to specify it a dozen times for each media element. 
(Same with &lt;source&gt;, it's controlled by the &lt;video&gt; element's 
cross-origin=&quot;&quot; attribute.) The &quot;Origin:&quot; header for all these cases isn't 
sent unless the cross-origin=&quot;&quot; attribute is specified. (Previously, 
&lt;track&gt; and &lt;video&gt; were specified to include it always.)

&lt;img&gt; obviously allows cross-origin access, yes. The spec didn't allow it 
for &lt;video&gt;, as it turns out. This is fixed now.

We can't allow the &quot;*&quot; mode without the cross-origin=&quot;&quot; attribute for the 
reasons Jonas posted earlier today, but I've made it support an explicit 
cross-origin opt-in, so if you know what domains are going to need it you 
can do the opt-in without adding the cross-origin=&quot;&quot; attribute everywhere.
