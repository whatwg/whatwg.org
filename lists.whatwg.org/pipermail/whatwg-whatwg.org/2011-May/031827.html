&gt;<i> The problem is with queryCommandValue. &#160;One of the reasons we support so
</I>&gt;<i> many block elements is so that queryCommandValue returns a sensible value.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;For example, if called queryCommandValue('FormatBlock') inside a
</I>&gt;<i> blockquote, I'd expect to get blockquote back, not an empty string.
</I>
I'd expect to get an empty string, if there's no line wrapper.  So if
you had &quot;foo&lt;br&gt;bar&quot;, querying the value would return nothing, and if
you formatted as &lt;p&gt;, it would become &quot;&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;&quot;.
Likewise, if you had &quot;&lt;blockquote&gt;foo&lt;br&gt;bar&lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;, querying
the value would return nothing and formatting as &lt;p&gt; would get
&quot;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;.

&gt;<i> I'm still skeptical that no web content depends on blockquote being
</I>&gt;<i> supported by FormatBlock on WebKit. &#160;You might argue that they'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> modify anyway due to IE not supporting it but most of editors do feature /
</I>&gt;<i> browser detection and heavily rely on their current behavior.
</I>
I just looked a bit more closely, and it turns out no one except
WebKit treats blockquote like other elements.  Given
&lt;blockquote&gt;foo&lt;/blockquote&gt; with &quot;foo&quot; selected, if you run
execCommand(&quot;formatBlock&quot;, false, &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;), Chrome 13 dev produces
&quot;&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&quot;.  IE9, Firefox 5.0a2, and Opera 11.10 produce
&quot;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;foo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;, which is what my current spec
says too.  So on that score, clearly WebKit's behavior is going to be
less web-compatible than the current spec.  On the other hand, Gecko's
and Opera's wrapping behavior means the command creates &lt;blockquote&gt;s
it can't remove, which doesn't seem useful at all.  IE's behavior
makes the most sense, and is as likely to be web-compatible as any of
the other three behaviors.

(Opera's behavior actually seems a bit complicated.  It will add
blockquote as a wrapper sometimes and replace a preexisting element
sometimes, but it seems it will never remove an existing blockquote.)

&gt;<i> And&#160;WebKit is
</I>&gt;<i> also a part of Mac OS X framework and native applications that use WebKit as
</I>&gt;<i> a part of their applications have no incentive to support Trident, Gecko, or
</I>&gt;<i> Opera behaviors.
</I>
I'm aiming to write something that works well for the web.  If you
have lots of non-web engine-specific content, maybe you'll eventually
need to have multiple modes, the way IE handles IE-only intranet
content.

&gt;<i> Okay, I'm fine with that. &#160;But I'm still not convinced that&#160;WebKit should
</I>&gt;<i> drop the support for other elements because there is virtually no benefit in
</I>&gt;<i> dropping the support other than the fact we'll conform to the spec.
</I>&gt;<i> In general, I'm not convinced that all browsers should support the exact set
</I>&gt;<i> of elements for FormatBlock. &#160;Having the set of elements supported by all
</I>&gt;<i> browsers seems to suffice.
</I>
It doesn't, as the example given above shows.  Supporting
blockquote/article/etc. the way WebKit does changes the behavior of
execCommand(&quot;formatBlock&quot;, false, &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;) also, in common cases.  Try
getting out an execCommand()-based WYSIWYG editor, type some text,
indent it, and then make it a header or pre or something.  In WebKit,
and only WebKit, this outdents the text.  That's very unexpected
behavior for the user.
