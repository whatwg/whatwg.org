<PRE>In many (all?) cases below the term &quot;execution&quot; is meant to include 
parsing and compilation. I know that's what Nicholas and Kyle have in 
mind, and is the motivation behind Gmail's comment hack and my ControlJS 
library.

If browsers processed (parsed &amp; compiled) scripts in a background thread 
it would mitigate the problem, but not solve it. Suppose I have 100K of 
JS I need right now to generate the DOM for the initial page, and I have 
another 500K of JS that's only needed if the user clicks on FeatureX. 
Assuming there's only one background thread, I want to prioritize the 
first 100K of JS on that thread, and not have it blocked by the 
unnecessary processing of the second script. Also, I only want to do the 
processing on the second script if the user activates the feature. This 
is important on mobile now to reduce power consumption but is also 
important on desktops as CPUs become more power sensitive and JS 
payloads grow.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PROPOSALS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The simplest solution to problem A seems to be to have the browsers do the
</I>&gt;<i> script parsing on a background thread, rather than blocking the UI. This
</I>&gt;<i> requires no changes to the specification at all. It can be combined with
</I>&gt;<i> lazy downloading by inserting a&lt;script&gt;  node when the script is needed;
</I>&gt;<i> basically, it is combining the &quot;downloading&quot; and &quot;parsing&quot; background
</I>&gt;<i> steps into one. There doesn't seem to be any need to treat them as
</I>&gt;<i> separate steps for solving problem A.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Add a new attribute to the&lt;script&gt;  called noexecute (for lack of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better term) that instructs the browser to download the script but do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not execute it. Developers must manually execute the code by calling an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execute() method on the script node. Simple example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> var script = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In step 12:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;For performance reasons, user agents may start fetching the script as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soon as the attribute is set, instead, in the hope that the element will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be inserted into the document. Either way, once the element is inserted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the document, the load must have started. If the UA performs such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prefetching, but the element is never inserted in the document, or the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> src attribute is dynamically changed, then the user agent will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execute the script, and the fetching process will have been effectively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wasted.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words, you can begin downloading one or more scripts (but not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executing them) by simply creating a script element dynamically and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setting its `src` property. The script will not be executed (even if it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finishes downloading) until the script element is added to the DOM. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this way, you can easily create several script elements (but not append
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them to the DOM), and then when you want to execute them, you simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> append them to the DOM in the order you prefer.
</I>&gt;<i> Given that the time the script takes to execute is already under the
</I>&gt;<i> control of the author, and can be trivially short, this solution doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem to address problem A: anything the browser does in the background
</I>&gt;<i> before the&lt;script&gt;  is inserted can just as easily be done in the
</I>&gt;<i> background after the&lt;script&gt;  is inserted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IE goes one step further, which I think is useful, which is to give a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `readyState` (and `onreadystatechange` event handling) to the script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> element, which notifies the code of the state of this &quot;preloading&quot;. Why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is useful is that you may choose to wait until all scripts have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finished loading before starting to execute them. Being notified of when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they finish loading (but not executing) can be a very useful addition to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this technique.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with this technique is that there's no guarantee that the
</I>&gt;<i> script will be downloaded at all -- it depends on the UA's belief about
</I>&gt;<i> what will lead to the best experience. For example, if the system has idle
</I>&gt;<i> cycles, it might happen sooner than if the UA is extremely busy already.
</I>&gt;<i> That's rather the point of the feature. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, readyState isn't actually especially useful here, at least not in
</I>&gt;<i> the context of problem A. Consider the two possibilities: (1) by the time
</I>&gt;<i> you want to run the script, it is already loaded, and (2) by the time you
</I>&gt;<i> want to run the script, it is not yet loaded. In (1), you can insert the
</I>&gt;<i> element into the DOM and it'll just work. And in (2)... well you want the
</I>&gt;<i> script to run ASAP, so why wait? You just insert the element into the DOM
</I>&gt;<i> and as soon as it can, the UA will execute it, and so again, it just
</I>&gt;<i> works. No need to track when it is ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you need to track when it's ready to make sure you execute another
</I>&gt;<i> script after it, then just using the 'load' event on&lt;script&gt;  is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficent: just wait for the previous script to have run, then insert the
</I>&gt;<i> one you care about. But really, it seems better to structure your scripts
</I>&gt;<i> so that they don't do anything when they are run except expose a callback
</I>&gt;<i> that you can run when you want the code to run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The wording in the spec lists this idea as &quot;may&quot;. I suggest that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion Nicholas has proposed should shift to discussing if the spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; to move it from being a suggestion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to being a directly specified thing (that way the other browsers besides
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IE have incentive to eventually include it)
</I>&gt;<i> (As a side-note, in the HTML spec the words &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; don't have
</I>&gt;<i> any normative meaning. See the &quot;Conformance requirements&quot; section.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;must&quot;, but it would merely constrain
</I>&gt;<i> implementations further: instead of being able to optimise in certain
</I>&gt;<i> situations by _not_ fetching scripts that might never be used, it would
</I>&gt;<i> force the network to be used in these situations. That seems like a loss,
</I>&gt;<i> and does nothing to address problem A.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. One use-case that I *am* quite familiar with is: script loaders (like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mine, LABjs) have the need to be able to download multiple scripts in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parallel (again, for performance optimization, but not just for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mobile!), but it's quite common that some scripts have dependencies on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each other.
</I>&gt;<i> Script loaders aren't a problem, they're a solution. What is the use case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that scripts loaded dynamically are not guaranteed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execute in any particular order. A mechanism for loading files in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parallel but controlling (or enforcing) their execution order, is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> There are a number of solutions to this problem now (onload, defer/async,
</I>&gt;<i> .async, the careful definitions of insertion/execution order, etc). What
</I>&gt;<i> is wrong with them that we need more solutions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For instance, if I have two groups of scripts (&quot;A.js&quot;, &quot;B.js&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;C.js&quot;) and (&quot;D.js&quot;, &quot;E.js&quot;, and &quot;F.js&quot;). Within each group, the order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must be maintained, but the two groups are completely independent. As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;async=false&quot; is currently implemented, you cannot accomplish isolating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the two groups of scripts from affecting each other. The &quot;D,E,F&quot; group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be forced to wait for the &quot;A,B,C&quot; group to finish executing.
</I>&gt;<i> When does this happen? Do you have a concrete example?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that there are multiple solutions to this already:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - put A,B,C into one file and D,E,F into one file.
</I>&gt;<i>   - write the scripts so that they don't rely on each other during
</I>&gt;<i>     execution, but instead expose a function that you can call when you
</I>&gt;<i>     want, e.g. when they are all loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>   - run the scripts in two iframes.
</I>&gt;<i>   - create&lt;script&gt;  elements ahead of time and insert then in order,
</I>&gt;<i>     allowing the browser to download and compile them in parallel, but
</I>&gt;<i>     insert them in the order you need them, when they are ready, using
</I>&gt;<i>     onload to trigger B from A and C from B, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Another plausible use-case that occurs to me is loading two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overlapping plugins (like for jQuery, for instance). The author may have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a simple calendar widget and a much more complex calendar widget, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the two may conflict or overlap in such a way that only one should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executed. But for speed of response, the author may want to &quot;preload&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both plugins and have them waiting on hand, and depending on what action
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user takes (or the state of data from an Ajax request), may then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decide at run-time which of the two plugins to execute.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have a page that tries to do that kind of thing? I don't think I've
</I>&gt;<i> ever come across this kind of thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In 95% of cases, I'd probably agree.
</I>&gt;<i> We're only generally aiming for 80% of cases, so if what we have now
</I>&gt;<i> handles 95% of cases, we're well past done!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most of the time, when a dev is painted into the corner in one of those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5% of cases where the browser's &quot;smarts&quot; are hindering their goal, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feels like the balance is too far to the side of &quot;let that be black-box
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inside the browser and you just don't worry about it&quot; to give a web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> author much of an option.
</I>&gt;<i> We're explicitly not trying to handle rare cases. There's too many big
