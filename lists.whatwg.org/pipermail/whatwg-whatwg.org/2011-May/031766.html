</I>&gt;<i> However, the method of extending forms with new input types is based on

</I>&gt;<i> input field as fallback. This idea gets somewhat broken if size and 
</I>&gt;<i> maxlength attributes cannot be used. Setting the visible width and 
</I>&gt;<i> imposing a maximum length of input in characters are often useful hints. 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g., for &lt;input type=&quot;time&quot;&gt;, it would be useful to have size=&quot;5&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> maxlength=&quot;5&quot; (perhaps combined with a CSS setting that sets the font to 
</I>&gt;<i> monospace for consistency) to convey or support a message about expected 
</I>&gt;<i> input format as well as to prevent some input errors.
</I>
During the transition period, I agree that it would be convenient to use 
maxlength=&quot;&quot; and size=&quot;&quot;. And so go ahead and do so.

The useful transition period won't be very long. By the time validators 
have caught up with the new rules, it won't be necessary any more. So in 
the spec, I've just gone ahead and specced the end game.


&gt;<i> There considerations also apply to HTML5-supporting browsers if they 
</I>&gt;<i> implement the new input types using text boxes. For example, input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;color&quot; could be implemented that way, with the required checks on 
</I>&gt;<i> the user input but with no color picker.
</I>
While this is possible, it's certainly not the intent. I don't think we 
should encourage it.


&gt;<i> Using CSS for the width is less satisfactory, since there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;(average) width of characters&quot; concept in CSS
</I>
The 'ch' unit.


&gt;<i> and there is no CSS counterpart to maxlength, which is a functional 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than presentational attribute.
</I>
True, but 'maxlength' is not hugely helpful anyway -- in fact, UAs are 
moving towards not restricting users to the maxlength during editing, only 
using it as a hint during form validation, due to its usability problems. 
That kind of effect can be duplicated in script for legacy UAs easily.


&gt;<i> For the input types mentioned, the meanings of size and and maxlength 
</I>&gt;<i> could be formulated so that user agents shall treat the size attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> as a suggested visible width of a text box used for the value as text, 
</I>&gt;<i> if such a presentation is used, and the maxlength attribute should be 
</I>&gt;<i> ignored, as it is only meant for nonconforming browsers that treat the 
</I>&gt;<i> element as having type=&quot;text&quot;.
</I>
I think allowing an attribute that does nothing is usually a sign of a 
mistake in the conformance rules. We don't want to be wasting authors' 
time, which (post-transition) is what this would be doing.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type='number' size='4' maxlength='4'&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> You could do:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body onload=&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   var i = document.getElementsByTagName('input')[0];
</I>&gt;<i>   if (i.type != 'number') {
</I>&gt;<i>     i.type = 'text';
</I>&gt;<i>     i.maxLength='4'; i.size='4'; i.oninput=/*a event handler*/;
</I>&gt;<i>     [...];
</I>&gt;<i>   }&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;input type='number'&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/body&gt;
</I>
This is no more conforming (it's just as invalid). The only difference is 
that a static validator can't catch it.

Unless such a UA exists, I'd rather not spend too much time worrying about 
how it would work.
