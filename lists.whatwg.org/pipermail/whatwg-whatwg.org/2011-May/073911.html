OK, I see.

&gt;&gt;<i> In addition, there is existing deployed content using the special names

</I>
I don't have links offhand, unfortunately; just past sidebar things I've 
used and now forgotten the location of plus documentation on the web 
about authoring things with target=&quot;_main&quot; [1].

I just tested what this document does in the main content area:

   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu">http://web.mit.edu</A>&quot; target=&quot;_main&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;

It looks like this opens a new browsing area in WebKit and Presto and 
loads the link in the tab I clicked the link in in Gecko and Trident 
(IE9).  I did not test the exact Trident behavior here; the Gecko 
behavior is that in the content area &quot;_main&quot; is an alias for &quot;_top&quot; (as 
opposed to targeting the currently open tab, say).  A bit of testing 
seems to suggest that Trident treats it as an alias for &quot;_self&quot; in at 
least some cases, corroborated by some threads out there [2].

A similar document with target=&quot;_content&quot; loads in a new browsing area 
in all the non-Gecko browsers; I can probably remove support for this 
from Gecko as well.

I did some googling just now, and pretty quickly found an actual web 
page that uses target=&quot;_main&quot;:  <A HREF="http://www.ejflavors.com/orangemoon/">http://www.ejflavors.com/orangemoon/</A>

The question of how to proceed here is a good one.  Supporting different 
targeting algorithms in different browsing contexts is a bit of a pain, 
so it would be good, imo, if we could converge the targeting algorithms 
for primary and secondary browsing contexts for fixed names....  That 
said, for target=&quot;_main&quot; even the primary browsing context interop story 
is sad, apparently.
