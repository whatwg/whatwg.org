<PRE>Hi Ian,

Wow, thanks for the excellent summary and discussion points. Since I helped instigate this thread, I'll try to help clarify some of my points. My point of reference is as the front end tech lead for the Yahoo! homepage (www.yahoo.com) redesign, as I'm talking about issues below, they are related to that experience.

There is a general need on the web for speed (duh). We want not just the current experience to be fast but the *next* experience to be fast. The next experience is frequently made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that isn't needed immediately, and so is deferred. The timing of when to download these resources is something that we've struggled with due to the various ways different resources get loaded.

We did a number of things on the Yahoo! homepage to help the next experience be fast (note: not all are still deployed):

1) After page load, we started to load CSS and JavaScript for the apps we previously had on the left side of the page. The intent was to make sure they came up as quickly as possible.

2) Preload images that may be needed for the next experience via (new Image().src = &quot;foo.png&quot;).

3) We delayed loading JavaScript for the search assist dropdown until the user set focus to the searchbox.

Your assertion that loading a file that simply defines a function will solve the problem is a bit too simplistic for most web applications. This is what we did in #1 and it actually caused performance problems as the browser would stop to execute the script as it came in, interrupting whatever the user was already doing. Amazingly, delays of longer than 100ms are actually perceivable by users[1], and small delays interrupt running animations very noticeably (a common complaint we had while testing some of the preload strategies).

Moving parsing and compilation to a background thread solves part of the problem, the problem where doing so freezes the UI currently. It doesn't solve what I consider to be the important part of the problem, and that is the inability to have a JavaScript resource downloaded but not applied to the page. The best next experience can only be achieved when the resources are ready and then applied at the right moment.

To be clear: this is not a problem that is unique to JavaScript. The same problem exists with all external resources, such as images and CSS. The difference is that both images and CSS allow you to download the resource and then apply to the page later when you want (images via new Image(), CSS via dynamic &lt;link&gt; element that is only applied when added to the page).

My request to have this for JavaScript, and the subsequent proposal on how to do it, was really to get parity with the other external resources so that we can get all of the resources for the *next* experience ready and available for application only when appropriate rather than trying to do a dance to get the timing right.

As discussed in the thread, there are pockets of people who are already trying to solve this problem using existing technology, and are only getting part of the way there using hacks. I put this in the category of CSS selectors in JavaScript: the use case wasn't very obvious, but clearly there was a problem people were trying to solve and this became a common solution that was later standardized. I think we're in that area for this JS downloading/executing issue as well.

Subject: [whatwg] Proposal for separating script downloads and execution


This thread was rather light on use cases and heavy on conjecture and
proposals. To make sure that we don't add features that are not actually
necessary, I have reordered this thread to go through the use cases first,
and to then only consider proposals based on how they address those use
cases. I have ignored all arguments drawn from conjecture and only looked
at those based on measured data or first-hand knowledge. If you think I
have ignored your e-mail incorrectly, please do not hesitate to bring my
attention to it; despite reading through the 158 messages on this thread
twice, I may have missed something important! Finally, at the end of this
e-mail I respond to several e-mails that purport to describe problems but
fail to do so, to illustrate the importance of actually describing the
real problem we are trying to solve before suggesting solutions.


USE CASES

Problem A:

</I>&gt;<i> for the official blog post about this technique.
</I>
The problem here seems to boil down to &quot;we want our script-heavy page to
load fast without blocking UI, but browsers block the UI thread while
parsing after downloading but before executing&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...] on mobile phones in particular the process of reading the contents
</I>&gt;<i> of a script tag [...] is way too slow and interrupts the UI.
</I>
Right, that's the same problem.

I shall refer to this as &quot;problem A&quot; below.

</I>
Why? The parsing doesn't have to block loading; it can all happen in the
background, while the page is loading.


&gt;<i> we should have a solid framework to allow modular codebases, as every
</I>&gt;<i> other serious application platform has.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;modular&quot;. Do you mean like dynamic linking
to libraries, where code is loaded later? We can do that now, just insert
a &lt;script&gt; element dynamically. Do you mean like system services? We can
do that now, with shared workers, which load in the background and are
shared amongst tabs. Do you mean like namespacing? That's a language-level
feature, I don't think HTML would be the right place to solve that.

I'm not sure what problem you mean here exactly.


&gt;<i> It also seems like it may become very useful to allow browsers to spend
</I>&gt;<i> time (whether idle time or otherwise) not just on parsing but on more
</I>&gt;<i> expensive optimizations, and having a framework that gives them access
</I>&gt;<i> to scripts to do that in advance seems like a very good idea.
</I>
&lt;script async&gt; seems to do this already.


PROPOSALS

The simplest solution to problem A seems to be to have the browsers do the
script parsing on a background thread, rather than blocking the UI. This
requires no changes to the specification at all. It can be combined with
lazy downloading by inserting a &lt;script&gt; node when the script is needed;
basically, it is combining the &quot;downloading&quot; and &quot;parsing&quot; background
steps into one. There doesn't seem to be any need to treat them as
separate steps for solving problem A.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Add a new attribute to the &lt;script&gt; called noexecute (for lack of a

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> document.head.appendChild(script);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> //later
</I>&gt;<i> script.execute();
</I>
Given that script execution (as opposed to the preprocessing that occurs
before execution, including parsing and compilation) can be trivially
fast (e.g. by making the script do nothing but expose an object), what is
the benefit of delaying the execution?

This doesn't seem to address problem A.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, you can begin downloading one or more scripts (but not

</I>&gt;<i> this way, you can easily create several script elements (but not append
</I>&gt;<i> them to the DOM), and then when you want to execute them, you simply
</I>&gt;<i> append them to the DOM in the order you prefer.
</I>
Given that the time the script takes to execute is already under the
control of the author, and can be trivially short, this solution doesn't
seem to address problem A: anything the browser does in the background
before the &lt;script&gt; is inserted can just as easily be done in the
background after the &lt;script&gt; is inserted.


&gt;<i> IE goes one step further, which I think is useful, which is to give a
</I>&gt;<i> `readyState` (and `onreadystatechange` event handling) to the script
</I>&gt;<i> element, which notifies the code of the state of this &quot;preloading&quot;. Why
</I>&gt;<i> this is useful is that you may choose to wait until all scripts have
</I>&gt;<i> finished loading before starting to execute them. Being notified of when
</I>&gt;<i> they finish loading (but not executing) can be a very useful addition to
</I>&gt;<i> this technique.
</I>
The problem with this technique is that there's no guarantee that the
script will be downloaded at all -- it depends on the UA's belief about
what will lead to the best experience. For example, if the system has idle
cycles, it might happen sooner than if the UA is extremely busy already.
That's rather the point of the feature. :-)

Also, readyState isn't actually especially useful here, at least not in
the context of problem A. Consider the two possibilities: (1) by the time
you want to run the script, it is already loaded, and (2) by the time you
want to run the script, it is not yet loaded. In (1), you can insert the
element into the DOM and it'll just work. And in (2)... well you want the
script to run ASAP, so why wait? You just insert the element into the DOM
and as soon as it can, the UA will execute it, and so again, it just
works. No need to track when it is ready.

If you need to track when it's ready to make sure you execute another
script after it, then just using the 'load' event on &lt;script&gt; is
sufficent: just wait for the previous script to have run, then insert the
one you care about. But really, it seems better to structure your scripts
so that they don't do anything when they are run except expose a callback
that you can run when you want the code to run.


&gt;<i> The wording in the spec lists this idea as &quot;may&quot;. I suggest that the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion Nicholas has proposed should shift to discussing if the spec
</I>&gt;<i> should:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot; to move it from being a suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> to being a directly specified thing (that way the other browsers besides
</I>&gt;<i> IE have incentive to eventually include it)
</I>
(As a side-note, in the HTML spec the words &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; don't have
any normative meaning. See the &quot;Conformance requirements&quot; section.)

We could change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;must&quot;, but it would merely constrain
implementations further: instead of being able to optimise in certain
situations by _not_ fetching scripts that might never be used, it would
force the network to be used in these situations. That seems like a loss,
and does nothing to address problem A.

That is entirely intentional: it's a UA optimisation; we don't want to
expose those, as it constrains what UAs can do to improve.

</I>
What would the onload=&quot;...&quot;s be? I don't understand the benefit of not
executing the scripts here. If you want your scripts to not do anything,
just have them not do anything except expose a function that you can call
whenever you want the actual code to run.

&lt;link rel=prefetch&gt; doesn't solve problem A because it doesn't give the UA
any hint that the resource is a script it should compile.

I don't see why it would preclude them from getting smarter. The smarts
wouldn't improve the pages with the hacks, but that's ok. It doesn't hurt
them either.


&gt;<i> This proposal is about a way to hint to the browser that only the

That doesn't solve problem A: you still end up blocking the UI when you do
the parsing if that's all you change.

AUTOLOAD doesn't reduce the time the parser spends blocking the UI thread;
it just spreads the time around. That doesn't really work for UI, where
it would cause jerkiness.

This seems equivalent to the noexecute=&quot;&quot; idea, but with different (worse)

It seems like &quot;when there's nothing else going on&quot; is the best time. How
would the script know when that is better than the UA?

</I>
It's clear that the parsing/compiling has to happen between download and
execution, it seems that the browser is in the best position to know when
it could do it with minimal impact on the rest of the system. If you just
want it to happen soon but don't care exactly when, we have &quot;async&quot;. If
you want it to happen now, then the spec also supports that. It's not
clear why anything else is needed.

The &quot;preload&quot;/onpreload part of this seems unnecesssary to solve problem
A: by the time the event fires, all the difficult work is done, and the
execution (the only thing this would allow you to delay, and the only
thing that has to block the UI thread) can be trivial in comparison. It
would be equivalent to just wrapping the code in the script in a function
that invokes the event manually and lets you call a callback.


The only proposed solution that seems to actually solve problem A is for
the browsers to do the compilation stage in the background. There's
nothing we need to add to the platform to support this, it will just work.

Now it's possible that there are other use cases that we should consider
that were not raised on this thread. If so, I encourage people to explain
the problem / use case with concrete examples in a new thread, without
conflating them with proposals. Then we can consider how to solve them.

I don't see any good reason to combine them. They seem emminently
separable and have very different characteristics (e.g. one has to be

one's results can be cached, the other cannot, one can be made essentially

Why not just run the code sometime before it is needed, while the page is

solved here, since the execution takes a trivially short time compared to
the download and compiling.

Mobile devices are hardly limited in power anymore. Heck, by the time
anything we discuss here is widely implemented, the average phone will
probably be dual-core. Our phones these days are ridiculously powerful.


&gt;<i> 1. One use-case that I *am* quite familiar with is: script loaders (like

Script loaders aren't a problem, they're a solution. What is the use case?

</I>
There are a number of solutions to this problem now (onload, defer/async,
.async, the careful definitions of insertion/execution order, etc). What
is wrong with them that we need more solutions?


&gt;<i> For instance, if I have two groups of scripts (&quot;A.js&quot;, &quot;B.js&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;C.js&quot;) and (&quot;D.js&quot;, &quot;E.js&quot;, and &quot;F.js&quot;). Within each group, the order
</I>&gt;<i> must be maintained, but the two groups are completely independent. As
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;async=false&quot; is currently implemented, you cannot accomplish isolating
</I>&gt;<i> the two groups of scripts from affecting each other. The &quot;D,E,F&quot; group
</I>&gt;<i> will be forced to wait for the &quot;A,B,C&quot; group to finish executing.
</I>
When does this happen? Do you have a concrete example?

Note that there are multiple solutions to this already:

 - put A,B,C into one file and D,E,F into one file.
 - write the scripts so that they don't rely on each other during
   execution, but instead expose a function that you can call when you
   want, e.g. when they are all loaded.
 - run the scripts in two iframes.
 - create &lt;script&gt; elements ahead of time and insert then in order,
   allowing the browser to download and compile them in parallel, but
   insert them in the order you need them, when they are ready, using
   onload to trigger B from A and C from B, etc.


&gt;<i> 2. Another plausible use-case that occurs to me is loading two
</I>&gt;<i> overlapping plugins (like for jQuery, for instance). The author may have
</I>&gt;<i> a simple calendar widget and a much more complex calendar widget, and
</I>&gt;<i> the two may conflict or overlap in such a way that only one should be
</I>&gt;<i> executed. But for speed of response, the author may want to &quot;preload&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> both plugins and have them waiting on hand, and depending on what action
</I>&gt;<i> the user takes (or the state of data from an Ajax request), may then
</I>&gt;<i> decide at run-time which of the two plugins to execute.
</I>
Do you have a page that tries to do that kind of thing? I don't think I've
ever come across this kind of thing.


&gt;<i> In 95% of cases, I'd probably agree.
</I>
We're only generally aiming for 80% of cases, so if what we have now
handles 95% of cases, we're well past done!


&gt;<i> Most of the time, when a dev is painted into the corner in one of those
</I>&gt;<i> 5% of cases where the browser's &quot;smarts&quot; are hindering their goal, it
</I>&gt;<i> feels like the balance is too far to the side of &quot;let that be black-box
</I>&gt;<i> inside the browser and you just don't worry about it&quot; to give a web
</I>&gt;<i> author much of an option.
</I>
We're explicitly not trying to handle rare cases. There's too many big
things to fix still to worry about the little ones.

Boris is entirely correct.

Note that per spec this can't be a _bogus_ type, it has to be the actual
type of the data used in the data block.

Don't worry, I read every e-mail.


Incidentally, just as a parting note: a lot of e-mails on this thread
seemed concerned about how hard something was to spec, for example
preferring solutions grounded in existing spec text, and avoiding
solutions that might be simple to implement but hard to spec. For the
record, how hard something is to spec is not an important consideration.
What matters is whether we solve use cases for authors, and within those
constraints, that we get something interoperable implemented in all the
relevant user agents (typically browsers, validators, or editors).
