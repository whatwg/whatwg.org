Masking the bug harder seems risky.  The problem would still exist, it would
just be a bit more obscure and even less understood.

or it has finished loading.

I imagine anything done here should be done for all load-related events,
like &lt;img onload&gt;.  It's probably not good to effectively disable
asynchronous load events for images.

These events could be split into two parts: one which is deferred until the
document is finished loading (&quot;load&quot;, &quot;canplay&quot;) and less obviously-named
ones which are fired normally (&quot;asyncload&quot;, &quot;asynccanplay&quot;), which people
are unlikely to use without at least looking at documentation to know they
exist.  That would give a &quot;safe&quot;, less-racy event by default, and give a
somewhat less obviously-named event for people who know what they're doing
and really don't want these events deferred.

That would regress performance for existing pages, though.
