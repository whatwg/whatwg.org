About video in particular, why would we not want video to be keyboard  
accessible in full-screen? I very often pause/unpause and seek using the  
keyboard when using standalone video players, and I'd like to do the same  
in the browser as well.

&gt;<i> As for games, it might be worth pointing out that gamers tolerate
</I>&gt;<i> amazing amounts of annoyance compared to normal users, because they
</I>&gt;<i> aren't doing anything important anyway and the momentary annoyance is
</I>&gt;<i> quickly eclipsed by the fun of playing the game.  Fullscreen games are
</I>&gt;<i> almost always going to be immersive things you play when you have
</I>&gt;<i> nothing else to do, so it might be perfectly tolerable to impose UI
</I>&gt;<i> that's more annoying than we'd normally tolerate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, to play Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines on Wine, I
</I>&gt;<i> had to go through a multi-minute setup procedure to get it to start
</I>&gt;<i> properly, but it didn't bother me much, since I'd then play for a few
</I>&gt;<i> hours.  I also once played a game to the end which would blue-screen
</I>&gt;<i> Windows about once every half-hour, so I'd just quicksave often and
</I>&gt;<i> restart the computer when it crashed.  Not to mention the countless
</I>&gt;<i> games that crash to desktop regularly, or suffer from other egregious
</I>&gt;<i> bugs.  And people put up with some games taking a minute or more to
</I>&gt;<i> load individual levels.  Not that any of this is ideal or desired, but
</I>&gt;<i> it should be kept in mind that full-screen games have different
</I>&gt;<i> requirements from things like video, which *need* to be effortless.
</I>
Do you think we should have different permission levels in full-screen  
which come with different levels of user prompting?

I don't think a persistent overlay is acceptable for either games or video  
and keyboard input is needed for both. (No, I don't think it's acceptable  
to require a mouse for video.)
