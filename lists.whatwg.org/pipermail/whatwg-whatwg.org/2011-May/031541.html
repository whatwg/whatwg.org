The argument for changing this seems somewhat compelling, if browsers are 
willing to change, especially just for the whitespace case. My 
recommendation for people who care about this is to get browser vendors to 
make this change and see if it causes compatibility problems. If it 
doesn't, we can update the spec. Please feel free to cc me on the relevant 
bugs if you would like my help in convincing browser vendors to try this. :-)
