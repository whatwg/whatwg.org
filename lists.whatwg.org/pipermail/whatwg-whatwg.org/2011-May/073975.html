I like the general idea, though i'm not too excited about the name
&quot;useCORS&quot;. But lets leave that bikeshedding for a more boring day :)

There is however one more decision that needs to be done. Does setting
&quot;useCORS&quot; make the CORS implementation execute with the &quot;supports
credentials&quot; flag set to true or false?

When set to true, the request to the server will contain the normal
cookies which the user has set for that domain. However, the response
from the server will have to contain &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
&lt;origin&gt;&quot;. In particular &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*&quot; will not be
treated as a valid response.

If the &quot;supports credentials&quot; flag is set to false, the request will
be made without cookies, and the server may respond with either
&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*&quot; or &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
&lt;origin&gt;&quot;.

I propose that the latter mode is used as it will make servers easier
to configure as they can just add a static header to all their
responses.
