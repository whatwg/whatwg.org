</I>&gt;<i> unfairly served if they are being told to go through the hassle of
</I>&gt;<i> changing browsers because of some trivial difference in rendering or
</I>&gt;<i> performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Red herring.

Subject is: &quot;Re: [whatwg] Mechanism to find available events&quot;

&gt;<i> So we can make all the technical improvements we want. But so long as
</I>&gt;<i> there is a conflict in goals for how to use a feature, as there often is
</I>&gt;<i> with hasFeature(), it is extremely unlikely that we can make that feature
</I>&gt;<i> work in a way that satisfies everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nobody proposed improving hasFeature. I have said many times that the
feature can't be expected to work; it's broken by design.

&gt;&gt;<i> If instead, there were a method designed to check the object in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question, it could be specified to require the implementation also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> check that object's capabilities.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not suggesting unequivocal (e.g. right click triggers a context
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> menu) -- that seems too much. I'm suggesting a more closely related
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inference check.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is a mechanism such as this possible? Why rule it out?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible, but it isn't clear that it will work as you anticipate,
</I>
What &quot;it&quot;? Nevermind, I probably shouldn't ask.

&gt;<i> and reasonably likely that it won't for the same non-technical reasons
</I>&gt;<i> hasFeature() doesn't. Improving (or replacing) hasFeature isn't an
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically bad idea, but it isn't useful without working out how to
</I>&gt;<i> resolve those non-technical issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The mobile world (whose UA-sniffing requirements make the one-Web goal on
</I>&gt;<i> Desktop look like a solid reliable reality where developers' lives are
</I>&gt;<i> trouble-free and pleasant) has an alternative solution that is based
</I>&gt;<i> around crowd-sourcing the information on whether something is supported.
</I>&gt;<i> It *is* UA-sniffing madness by most definitions, and it relies on huge
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of data and a system for managing conflicting statements via
</I>&gt;<i> simple trust modelling (it theoretically offers massive scope for abuse
</I>&gt;<i> that permits direct market manipulation), but it has worked well enough
</I>&gt;<i> for them that it is extremely widely used, and the approach has been
</I>&gt;<i> repeated, &quot;merely making technical refinements&quot;, over successive
</I>&gt;<i> generations of the technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Oh boy ,here we go...

When if ever is browser sniffing a &quot;requirement&quot;? It is
(euphamistically speaking)  technological solution. The discussion of
why it is an awful solution to the &quot;too many browsers&quot; problem is off
topic. Yep, this is another red herring. It's so outlandish that it
almost appears as trolling or flame bait. But again, we can forget all
about that.

&gt;<i> Going down that path of course doesn't allow you to do the work
</I>&gt;<i> client-side, which is also a problem for the use-case you're looking at.
</I>

&gt;<i> But in an area where I mostly see bad alternatives, it is another option
</I>&gt;<i> that could be the lesser of the available evils in some circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You're imagining something here.

&gt;<i> cheers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You have sidetracked the discussion.
