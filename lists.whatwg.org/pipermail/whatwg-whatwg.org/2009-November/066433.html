</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the absence of push/replaceState, changes to document.title

</I>&gt;<i> Calling pushState unlinks them in the sense that after the call,

</I>
This seems to be a bit of an extrapolation from the spec. The spec doesn't 
say what the title should be when the pushState() method hasn't been 
called; that it is linked to the latest state of the &lt;title&gt; element is 
not required by HTML5 as far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> To modify the history entry's title when residing at a history entry 
</I>&gt;<i> which was pushState'd to, you have to call replaceState.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> Thus you'd need to call history.replaceState(currentStateObject, 
</I>&gt;<i> newTitle) when you changed document.title on a page which was 
</I>&gt;<i> pushState'd to and wanted to reflect that change in the history entry. 
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose Gmail wanted to update the unread messages count in both the 
</I>&gt;<i> history and in document.title.
</I>
Why would GMail ever want to update the unread count in the history? That 
would make no sense.


&gt;<i> Honestly, I don't think adding an extra set of titles will be 
</I>&gt;<i> particularly useful, and I imagine that most websites will use just one 
</I>&gt;<i> title for both the history entry and the browser title.  But that's 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the problem: As soon as you call pushState, you now have to be 
</I>&gt;<i> aware that changes to document.title now no longer affect the history 
</I>&gt;<i> title.
</I>
I don't understand under what conditions this would be a bad thing. It 
seems to me that once you're calling pushState(), this is exactly what you 
would want.


&gt;<i> To be clear, my contention is that pushState shouldn't have a title 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter, not that we should have a updateHistoryEntryTitle() function.  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm fine with the idea of the history entry title reflecting the state 
</I>&gt;<i> of document.title immediately before the most recent time we navigated 
</I>&gt;<i> away from that entry, as it does now.  But if we want to allow the 
</I>&gt;<i> titles to be set independently, I don't think pushState is the right 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.
</I>
I don't think we want titles to be set independently. It doesn't make 
sense to adjust the history title unless you're also adjusting the URL or 
state object, IMHO.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; By analogy, none of us would argue that we should couple setting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; document.title with clicking links and setting document.location.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, I would; that's exactly what I'm arguing in fact. With 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normal navigation, the coupling is done by the UA (first setting the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; title to the URL, and then updating it when a &lt;title&gt; element is found 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; during parsing). With pushState(), the &quot;navigation&quot; is implicit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (scripted) and so the URL and title changes have to be done 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explicitly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't suggest that we shouldn't have a updateHistoryEntryTitle() 
</I>&gt;<i> function, just as the existence of &lt;title&gt; doesn't suggest that code for 
</I>&gt;<i> modifying the document's title should be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     document.navigateTo(document.location, newTitle)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Adding an updateHistoryEntryTitle() function while leaving the title 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter in pushState might be better than things are now.  But since 
</I>&gt;<i> we have to explicitly set document.title after a pushState anyway, 
</I>&gt;<i> removing the title from pushState doesn't create any more work for the 
</I>&gt;<i> vast majority of use cases.
</I>
Why would you have to change the document.title?


&gt;<i> I don't see why we need to add all this complexity to support the edge 
</I>&gt;<i> use case where the history title and document title are different.
</I>
I don't think it's an edge case. I think it's likely pretty much the only 
case, or at least the most common case.
