I assume you mean &quot;the spec as it is now&quot; and not &quot;the spec as it was 
when Gecko implemented get/putImageData&quot;?  The latter was quite 
different, as I recall.

</I>
Sure; the point is that in Gecko the thing returned by 
getImageData().data is not a DOM object at all but a JS Array. 
Similarly, the object returned by getImageData() is not a DOM object, 
but a JS Object.  Likewise, putImageData accepts any JS Object with the 
right properties on it (width, height, and data).

I _think_ as of when the implementation was created some of this (e.g. 
the putImageData behavior) was called for by the then-whatwg spec.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/</A> for example; I believe 
there were other drafts between the 2005-01 draft and that one that had 
still other behavior.

As you note the spec has since changed; the Gecko implementation hasn't 
been changed yet pending us having some indication that the spec is 
actually stable now.  Once burnt, twice shy and all.

In any case, I simply didn't know whether CanvasPixelArray was 
implemented as a host object or a native object in webkit, and didn't 
want to make any claims about it as a result.
