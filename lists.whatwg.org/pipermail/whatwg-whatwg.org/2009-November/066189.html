</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implicit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unlocking by having any nested attempt to acquire a lock cause the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> existing lock
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be dropped.  Nesting can happen in the cases you mention, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> depending on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the UA, it may happen for other reasons too.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What reasons?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If these reasons are situations where it's fundamentally difficult,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> impossible, or non-performant to follow the spec, we should change the spec.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Otherwise this would just be a bug in the UA.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My point is that it is difficult to ensure that all situations where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nesting can occur are understood apriori and that the list doesn't change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over time.  Because we are talking about multi-threading synchronization in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a very complex system, I would much prefer a more isolated and less fragile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unlock if yieldForStorageUpdates is called.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unlock when returning from script execution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unlock if another attempt to lock occurs (any form of nesting).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the third case, I'd probably log something to the JS console to alert
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe this simple implementation covers most of the cases enumerated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the spec, and it has the property of being easier to reason about and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to support (more future proof).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this would make the spec too dependent on implementation details.
</I>&gt;<i> If your implementation needlessly or accidentally &quot;nests&quot; script execution
</I>&gt;<i> --- e.g. by firing an event synchronously that should be, or could be,
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous --- then you'd still conform to your spec while the behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> you present to authors gets quietly worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your description is (or can be, after suitable modifications) equivalent
</I>&gt;<i> to what the spec currently says, but the equivalence is subtle (which it
</I>&gt;<i> would be!), then I think they should *both* be in the spec, and the spec
</I>&gt;<i> should say they're equivalent. Then if we find they're not equivalent, we
</I>&gt;<i> clearly have a bug in the spec which must be fixed --- not carte blanche to
</I>&gt;<i> proceed in an undesirable direction. It would be a sort of spec-level
</I>&gt;<i> assertion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think the spec currently calls attention to only some situations that
could lead to nesting of implicitly acquired storage locks.

I previously described some other situations, which you and others indicated
should be treated as WebKit and IE bugs.  I didn't look very far to dig
those up.  After some more thought, I came up with these additional cases
that the spec doesn't cover:

1a) Given a page (domain A) containing an iframe (domain B), have the outer
page navigate the inner frame to &quot;about:blank&quot;.  This navigation completes
synchronously, and the unload handler for the iframe runs before the
navigation request completes.  This is true of all browsers.

1b) Suppose the inner page has a pending XMLHttpRequest when the outer frame
navigates the inner frame.  The XHR's onabort handler would run before the
navigation to &quot;about:blank&quot; completes.

2) Set a break point in the Mozilla JS debugger.  This runs a nested event
loop each time you single step so that it can drive the rest of the browser
UI.

3) Install a Firefox extension that runs a nested event loop in response to
an event generated by content.  I debugged many Firefox crashes resulting
from extensions that do this kind of thing for various reasons.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For example, a JS library might evolve to use flash for something small
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> storage or sound) that it previously didn't use when I first developed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my code.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Voila, now my storage lock is released out from under me.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This example still sounds overly contrived to me. Nevertheless, it seems
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> strange to say that because there might be a few unexpected race conditions,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you have decided to allow a much larger set of unexpected race conditions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why is it contrived?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because libraries tend to initially use plugins and move towards using core
</I>&gt;<i> browser functionality, not the other way around. But even if these library
</I>&gt;<i> issues aren't contrived, I don't see how they justify making things a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more unpredictable for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not convinced.  Look at Google Maps and street view.  Gmail uses more
Flash now than it used to.  Wave uses Gears for a variety of little things.
 There's a cool video gadget that swaps between HTML5 video or Flash
depending on the browser and the target media.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What will you do for Gecko when it supports content processes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Implement the spec, I hope!
</I>

It seems odd to me that this behavior was put into the spec without any
implementation experience to guide it.  The only multi-process
implementations that I know of do not have a storage mutex.
