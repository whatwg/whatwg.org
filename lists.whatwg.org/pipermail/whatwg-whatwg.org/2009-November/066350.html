Yes, but your condition 1 is that the value returned is independent of 
running conditions....

&gt;<i> The condition 2 and 3 may be not well-expressed, however, the condition

</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> I reformulate this way the conditions 2 and 3:
</I>&gt;<i> - In &quot;blank conditions&quot; (no other processes/thread running on the CPU,
</I>&gt;<i> enough memory to allocate the workers), running the same algorithm (an
</I>&gt;<i> easy delegation algorithm) has significantly better performances with
</I>&gt;<i> (navigator.optimalWorkerNumber) dedicated workers than with
</I>&gt;<i> (navigator.optimalWorkerNumber -1) dedicated workers
</I>&gt;<i> - In &quot;blank conditions&quot;, running the same algorithm has no significantly
</I>&gt;<i> better performances with (navigator.optimalWorkerNumber+1) dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> workers than with (navigator.optimalWorkerNumber) dedicated workers
</I>
OK, but I'm not sure this is a useful number, then, since these &quot;blank 
conditions&quot; never happen in practice.

&gt;<i> Just to remind, the purpose of this attribute is to decide, at the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of a delegation algorithm what is the &quot;optimal&quot; number of
</I>&gt;<i> workers to divide the work in a way that is optimal regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware, the OS and the worker implementation.
</I>
I'm glad you put &quot;optimal&quot; in quotes.... ;)

Is there a reason that apps that really care about this shouldn't just 
measure to see what number works best for them?

&gt;<i> The idea behind this property is that even if you start running the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm with a lot of concurrent processes, you create a number of
</I>&gt;<i> workers that cannot be ran concurrently at the beginning, but you may
</I>&gt;<i> use optimally the ressources later
</I>
But in the meantime you will be using them very suboptimally, no?

&gt;<i> (if the other processes/threads stop
</I>&gt;<i> running, what you cannot control, but can still hope that it happens
</I>&gt;<i> during the &quot;algorithm lifetime&quot;. According to the spec, &quot;workers are
</I>&gt;<i> expected to be long-lived&quot;).
</I>
Most of my apps are long-lived...
