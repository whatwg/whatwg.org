I admit I didn't look closely.  At a guess, maybe the default
WordPress skin(s) are valid XHTML, but custom skins are very popular
for WordPress and those mostly aren't valid XHTML?  MediaWiki is
unreasonably difficult to reskin, so that's not much of a problem for
us . . .

&gt;<i> Sure. &#160;0.01% of all websites is a &quot;significant number&quot;. &#160;I just think it's

You're probably right.

&gt;<i> Or stop using HTML named entities, yes.
</I>
That's not really a very good option, given the size of MediaWiki's
code base and the size of Wikipedia's database, and the ugliness of
trying to remember what &#160; is when reading the HTML source.  It
sounds like we're stuck with a legacy doctype if we don't want to
break screen-scrapers.
