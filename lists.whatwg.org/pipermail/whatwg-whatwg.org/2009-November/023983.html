<PRE>By &quot;API operation&quot; I mean anything other than core ecmascript and  
localstorage itself.

Eg you can be sure that the following will not release the mutex:
* do nothing
* function call
* if/for etc
* access to a local variable
* access to a basic ecmascript object (not host objects)

But anything else outside core ecmascript is free to release the mutex  
if it wants. Eg any call to dom or any access to any object provided  
by the host. Rather than telling them what *can* release the mutex, we  
instead tell them to assume that everything can unless it is in our  
list of things that *can't*.

This is intentionally broad for several reasons:
* to avoid us having to work out the full list of all cases that could  
require any user agent to release the mutex
* to give users an easy rule that they can remember and know will  
always be safe on any user agent
* to give the user agent the freedom to release the mutex as soon as  
possible, thus improving concurrency [I am rep for Intel so I care  
about this]


Apologies for being vague earlier.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another concern is that the worst case performance aspects of
