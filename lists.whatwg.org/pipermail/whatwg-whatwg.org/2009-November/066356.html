Interesting.  I have several browser processes using timeslices right 
now (the incessant XHR google apps tend to do, I think), plus at least 
two other things running that are fully using up one core and most of 
another, as I write this mail.

I don't see how a browser could return a single number that would &quot;work&quot; 
or both of us.

&gt;<i> My point is that this number may be available very easily. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> in my dual-core, Linux, Firefox 3.5, the number is 2.
</I>
OK, what about in Firefox 3.6?  If your worker plans to not allocate 
many strings and the like, it's 2.  Otherwise, it's 1 (because a good 
bit of gc finalization has been moved to a separate thread).

&gt;<i> Why spare an information that can be useful and reliable (more than measurement at
</I>&gt;<i> least !) ?
</I>
Because the information is _not_ reliable.  The optimal number of 
concurrent threads of execution given a given fixed set of computation 
resources is heavily dependent on the behavior of the threads of 
execution and what else is using the computation resources...

Put another way, as a UA implementor I don't know what I'd make this 
attribute return without it being a bald-faced lie in pretty simple cases.

&gt;<i> =&gt;  Yes and no. No one can know if they will be optimally used or not.
</I>&gt;<i> What you are &quot;garanteed&quot; (quotes again) is that in &quot;blank conditions&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> they will be optimally used (which is more or less the definition of
</I>&gt;<i> this number).
</I>
See above; even in &quot;blank conditions&quot; this may well depend on the exact 
workload of your workers.
