<PRE>I think clearState() is a good idea but is just spec'ed poorly.

Imagine the use case of the checkout procedure at an online merchant.

There's normally steps like &quot;enter your address,&quot; &quot;choose your shipping method,&quot; &quot;enter your CC info,&quot; and finally &quot;place your order.&quot;  It'd be pretty neat if they used this new API to make it so the user could use the built-in back/forward buttons to switch between the various steps to update the information.

But once the user has finished the &quot;place your order&quot; step and is presented with an order confirmation, all of the previous steps are irrelevant.  The site would be prudent to clear them all out so the user is under the impression they can go back and continue to play with the details of their order.  In this case, clearState() fits the bill greatly!

It is true that what is really being performed is &quot;truncate this part of history.&quot;  But we wouldn't to give scripts the ability to control parts of session history they don't own.  And the only way we know which session history entries are owned by a Document is when this new API is used, where the same Document object is shared between history entries.

One might argue that we should give finer grained control - letting a Document remove some of the history entries it owns but not others.  I might be able to think of a use-case for that, but I don't see it being tremendously important.  It could always be added later if there's demand for it.

I think we just need to get the language in shape so the spec is interpreted the same by everyone and is implementable.

</I>&gt;<i> clearState as it exists doesn't match this use case particularly well.
</I>&gt;<i> If we were concerned about clobbering history, we'd probably want to

</I>&gt;<i> URLs right would be pretty tricky, especially if clearState took you
</I>&gt;<i> to the last entry for the document, as currently specified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> clearState is also useless if you don't use this single-document

</I>&gt;<i> web application which loads multiple documents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the use case I proposed is much better served by something
</I>&gt;<i> like history.truncate(numBefore, numAfter), which would remove all but
</I>&gt;<i> the numBefore entries before the current entry and the numAfter
</I>&gt;<i> entries after the current entry.  We'd subject this to the same-origin
</I>&gt;<i> policy, of course, and stop removing entries in a direction as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> we encountered an entry from another origin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if history.truncate() is a good idea -- do we really want
</I>&gt;<i> to give pages that kind of control over the history? -- but at least I
</I>&gt;<i> can actually imagine a page using it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps a better idea is leaving this whole issue to the UA, which
</I>&gt;<i> could collapse all the entries from a single origin in the UI.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> we wouldn't need either function.
