</I>&gt;<i> One might argue that we should give finer grained control - letting a Document remove some of the history entries it owns but not others. &#160;I might be able to think of a use-case for that, but I don't see it being tremendously important. &#160;It could always be added later if there's demand for it.

As a user of a site, I'm not really sure that that's what I would like
to have happen. I can see wanting to be able to go back to those pages
to for example see what information I filled out. In general I'm
always annoyed as a user when I can't go back to pages that I've left
(it's why I pushed the back-button in the first place).

And in any event I don't think clearState provides enough fine grained
control to be able to satisfy this use case. I would imagine that in
many cases a call to clearState would nuke not just the
checkout-wizard, but likely also navigation the happened before that.

In order to satisfy this use case I'd imagine you'd need the ability
to remove a precise range of session history entries. And be able to
do so in a way that doesn't get messed up if the user created
additional session history entries by clicking links such as &lt;a
href=&quot;#sizeinfo&quot;&gt;Check size information here before buying&lt;/a&gt;.
