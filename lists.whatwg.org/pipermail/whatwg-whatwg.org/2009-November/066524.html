Fixed.

It's not clear to me what the best number of workers is. It's not the 
number of CPUs, cores, or hardware threads, since it depends at least as 
much on the system load as on the system capabilities. And it varies over 
time, since the load is a function of time.


&gt;<i> In the delegation example, the number of workers chosen is an arbitrary

</I>
That depends on the algorithm. If the algorithm uses a lot of data, then 
a single hardware thread might be able to run two workers in the same time 
as it runs one, with one worker waiting for data while the other runs 
code, and with the workers trading back and forth.

Personally I would recommend basing the number of workers on the number of 
shards that the input data is split into, and then relying on the UA to 
avoid thrashing. I would expect UAs to notice when a script spawns a 
bazillion workers, and have the UA run them in a staggered fashion, so as 
to not starve the system resources. This is almost certainly needed 
anyway, to prevent pages from DOSing the user's system.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, on a 16-core processor (which doesn't exist yet, but 
</I>&gt;<i> is a realistic idea for the next couple of decades), the task could be 
</I>&gt;<i> executed faster with 16 workers.
</I>
Well, again, that's not a given. If the algorithm is mostly network-bound 
or disk-bound, then it might well be that running multiple workers doesn't 
really gain you anything, and you might as well just do everything in one 
worker. It's hard to make generalisations about this kind of thing.


&gt;<i> Moreover, for a totally other purpose, this attribute could be used to 
</I>&gt;<i> make statistics on the spread of multicore processors like the 
</I>&gt;<i> statistics that are already done for operating system or screen 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution use.
</I>
Do we really want to expose this? That seems like a minor privacy leak.

Indeed.

This is a reasonably good idea. It might make sense to do in v2 of Web 
Workers.


I haven't added anything to Web Workers for now.
