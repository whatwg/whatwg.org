Right. That's what I figured the point is; I just wanted to check to  
make sure I wasn't missing something.

As implemented by Safari and Chrome (which is the minimum rate allowed  
by the spec), it's not really useful for that purpose, as 4 updates  
per second makes any sort of synchronization feel jerky and laggy. If  
it were done at the frame rate of the video, or perhaps with a minimum  
of 25 frames per second, it would be much more useful. Even at a  
minimum of 15 frames per second, you would still be able to get some  
sorts of useful synchronization, though animations synchronized  
wouldn't feel as smooth as they could.

&gt;<i> Would something like &lt;video&gt; firing events for every frame rendered  
</I>&gt;<i> help you out?  This would help also fix the &lt;canvas&gt; over/under  
</I>&gt;<i> painting issue and improve synchronization.
</I>
Yes, this would be considerably better than what is currently specced.
