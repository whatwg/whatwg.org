<PRE>[this is Rob Ennals from Intel]

I assume the use case for this is to allow parallel processing of a  
potentially large set of data?

Maybe what we really want here is some kind of parallel map operation  
where we give the user agent an array and then say &quot;call this function  
on each element, using as many threads as you deem appropriate&quot; given  
the resources available. Each function call would logically execute in  
it's own worker context, but to keep semantics transparent, we might  
declare that such workers are not be allowed to send messages (other  
than a final result) and so could not tell how many parallel workers  
had actually been created.

In the single core case this reduces to creating a single worker and  
then executing each function call in sequence. In the 1000 way cores  
of the not-so-distant future it will schedule tasks as appropriate.


I'm not convinced that it is a good idea to expose details like the  
number o processor cores to a user. Such numbers can be messy. What if  
it changes? What if some of them are faster than others? What if  
another app is using some of them? What if they have different  
instruction sets? What if we'd like to keep some powered off? What if  
some are expensive to communicate with? What if we don't have enough  
memory to do them all in parallel? What if they cant all share cache?  
What is some jobs complete earlier than others? I don't think we  
should trust user code to know how many threads they should create.

If what they want is to do a parallel map over a set of items making  
optimal use of the available resources, then we should give them a  
primitive that does exactly that. If we felt clever we might want to  
allow shuffle and reduce as well.


Thoughts?
