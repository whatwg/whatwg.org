Maybe you mean &quot;hardware thread&quot; instead of &quot;core&quot;?  If so, the machine 
I'm writing this message on has 16 HW threads (2 CPUs x 4 cores/CPU x 2 
HW threads/core).  And there's the

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_2</A>

which has been shipping for a while now, and has 64 HW threads.  (If we 
wanted to talk GPGPUs, we'd be in the 1000s of HW threads and 100s of 
cores.  Some crazy person could make simple worker computations work on 
GPGPUs ;) .)

I completely agree that telling a web app the number of &quot;free cores&quot; 
(idle HW threads?) at a given point in time is useless, and probably 
counterproductive, even if it could be done.

 &gt; it's own worker context, but to keep semantics transparent, we might

 &gt; than a final result) and so could not tell how many parallel workers had

This.  It's just the SPMD model, ported to web workers.

Though I'm not sure what's gained by hiding the number of allocated 
parallel workers from the app, after they've been allocated.  IMHO this 
isn't a decision that should change over the duration of the computation.

If I were writing a computationally-bound webapp, I would want an 
interface like

[main thread]
   SharedWorker.parallelMap(workerfn [, ...]])

[worker thread]
   function workerfn(myThreadIndex, numberOfworkerfns [, ...]) {
      // partition problem dataset [...] based on |myThreadIndex| and 
|<i>numberOfworkerfns|
</I>      // compute
   }

Cheers,
Chris
