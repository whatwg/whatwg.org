<PRE>In spec language, I think it should be &quot;MAY&quot; release.

In practice, even if it was MUST release, users could potentially see
different behaviour, due to the different scheduling behaviour of
different thread systems etc. Race conditions are inherently
statistical, depending on what happens to be running at a particular
time, and that can depend on all sorts of different variables outside
ones control. This is one of the things that makes concurrent code
icky.

As you say, making it MUST release would be a pain to implement.


I think that &quot;MAY&quot; release still helps a lot more than &quot;nothing&quot;. If
we have &quot;nothing&quot; then users don't know whether they can be sure that
a sequence of localStorage operations will be atomic.

E.g., I may want to write:

x = localStorage.bla
localStorage.bla = x+1

or
localStorage.x = localStorage.x - amount
localStorage.y = localStorage.y + amount

These are useful idioms that are only guaranteed to work if we promise
users that the storage mutex cannot be released part way through the
transaction.

You do however make a very good point. It is important that we don't
encourage users to write programs that might behave differently on
different implementations, and thus get tripped up when different
implementations happen to schedule things differently. I think that
maybe some kind of warnings mode could help here, where we scream
loudly if the user does two localStorage operations in the same thread
with a potentially mutex-dropping operation in between.
