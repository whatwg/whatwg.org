I use timeupdate to register a callback that will update captions/subtitles.

The alternative is to use the setInterval (or setTimeout) function
which checks regularly whether your video's currentTime is still
within your subtitle element.

I think timeupdate is very useful, in particular since it is more
accurate than checking currentTime.

But I also think we need to add another mechanism to register events
with the video/audio element that are triggered at the registered time
(or within an interval). This would avoid constant polling for
captions.

At TPAC in the video breakout group we discussed a little how to
re-introduce something like cue ranges in the context of captions in a
declarative manner. We still need to make this more concrete, but it
may be similar to the onenter and onleave events that the itextlist
element has in <A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/HTML5_captions_v2">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/HTML5_captions_v2</A>
.

Cheers,
Silvia.
