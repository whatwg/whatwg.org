I concede, given portions of your previous arguments, that &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;
is sufficient for citing bibliographic entries represented in HTML.
Redefining the &lt;cite&gt; element for the purpose of supporting
bibliographic citations (according to the scheme I previously
proposed) probably adds too much additional complexity that would
likely go underused by page authors. I am at least happy that the
current HTML5 definition of cite for marking up the &quot;titles of works&quot;
has been refined from the HTML4 version.

However, I do have a small proposal that I would be interested in
hearing feedback on.
What if a standard link type called &quot;citation&quot; was added to the HTML5
specification? For example,

&lt;a href=&quot;#bibentry-jones&quot; rel=&quot;citation&quot;&gt;[Jones, p. 88]&lt;/a&gt;

After reviewing all the other link types and their corresponding
definitions in current draft specification this seems like a
consistent addition.
The value proposition here is that a standardized way to explicitly
indicate a &quot;bibliographic citation&quot; is available to authors that can
be exploited by search engines to improve the relevance of searches. I
acknowledge that I do not speak for the makers of major commercial
search engines but I do have some experience in the area of structured
search. I'd wager that providing this standardized semantic hook
(i.e., rel=&quot;citation&quot;) could only open up opportunities for new
functionality at little cost to the HTML5 specification.

&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, what is the reasoning in the HTML5 spec for stating that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ship names should not be marked up with &lt;cite&gt; but should use &lt;i&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I'm saying, why are ships not considered &quot;works?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose one could indeed make a somewhat convincing argument that a ship
</I>&gt;<i> is a work. I'm not sure I'd want to try to sell that though. I've removed
</I>&gt;<i> the sentence that says a ship isn't a work, but I haven't added ships to
</I>&gt;<i> the list works.
</I>
Thanks. I believe not going out of your way to indicate that a ship
name is not the title of a work is a safe decision.

The definition I have in mind when I think of a &quot;work&quot; is along the
lines of &quot;something produced or accomplished by effort, exertion, or
the exercise of skill &lt;this book is the work of my hands&gt;&quot; - Merriam
Webster Dictionary
(<A HREF="http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/work">http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/work</A>). Which I
believe would include a ship as well as sculptures and books.
Although, I agree it is more common to reference works from literature
or art than engineering as their primary purpose is to convey
information through observation/analysis.
