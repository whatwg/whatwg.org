</I>=&gt; If you are comparing &quot;no other processes running&quot; and &quot;one other
process which is also completely cpu-bound running&quot;, you are not in what
I've called &quot;same running conditions&quot;. (because the number of concurrent
processes is different).

The condition 2 and 3 may be not well-expressed, however, the condition
1 is very important and particularly the fact that this number is
independant of the &quot;running conditions&quot; (which are, IMHO, totally out of
the scope of a high-level spec such as the web-workers one) and
shouldn't be determined dynamically.

I reformulate this way the conditions 2 and 3:
- In &quot;blank conditions&quot; (no other processes/thread running on the CPU,
enough memory to allocate the workers), running the same algorithm (an
easy delegation algorithm) has significantly better performances with
(navigator.optimalWorkerNumber) dedicated workers than with
(navigator.optimalWorkerNumber -1) dedicated workers
- In &quot;blank conditions&quot;, running the same algorithm has no significantly
better performances with (navigator.optimalWorkerNumber+1) dedicated
workers than with (navigator.optimalWorkerNumber) dedicated workers

Just to remind, the purpose of this attribute is to decide, at the
beginning of a delegation algorithm what is the &quot;optimal&quot; number of
workers to divide the work in a way that is optimal regarding the
hardware, the OS and the worker implementation.
No matter the running conditions, 2 calls return the same value for the
same hardware//OS//Worker implementation.
The idea behind this property is that even if you start running the
algorithm with a lot of concurrent processes, you create a number of
workers that cannot be ran concurrently at the beginning, but you may
use optimally the ressources later (if the other processes/threads stop
running, what you cannot control, but can still hope that it happens
during the &quot;algorithm lifetime&quot;. According to the spec, &quot;workers are
expected to be long-lived&quot;).

Thanks for your feedback

David
