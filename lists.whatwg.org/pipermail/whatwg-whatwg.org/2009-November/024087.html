The idea is that the string you would put into the back button or history 
menu is not the same as the string you would put into the title bar or 
bookmarks (i.e. not the same as &lt;title&gt;).


&gt;<i> The following text describes clearState():
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;When this method is invoked, the user agent must remove from the 
</I>&gt;<i> session history all the entries from the first state object entry for 
</I>&gt;<i> that Document object up to the last entry that references that same 
</I>&gt;<i> Document object, if any.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then, if the current entry was removed in the previous step, the current 
</I>&gt;<i> entry must be set to the last entry for that Document object in the 
</I>&gt;<i> session history.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine the following scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A document has 5 state entries.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They each have a different URL as follows:  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?1,">http://www.example.com/page.html?1,</A> <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?2,">http://www.example.com/page.html?2,</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?3,">http://www.example.com/page.html?3,</A> <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?4,">http://www.example.com/page.html?4,</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> and <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?5">http://www.example.com/page.html?5</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current entry is the 3rd entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A script calls &quot;clearState()&quot; so these entries are all cleared out, 
</I>&gt;<i> including the current entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the current entry was removed, the current entry after the 
</I>&gt;<i> clearState() call is changed to be the last entry for the Document.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My reading of the spec is that after clearState() returns, the entries 
</I>&gt;<i> 1-4 will be gone completely, the state object for entry 5 will have been 
</I>&gt;<i> cleared, and entry 5 will now be the current entry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has the side effect of the URL for the current entry - 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?5">http://www.example.com/page.html?5</A> - not matching the current URL of the 
</I>&gt;<i> document - <A HREF="http://www.example.com/page.html?3">http://www.example.com/page.html?3</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is my understanding of what the current entry should be correct?
</I>&gt;<i> If not, what am I missing?
</I>&gt;<i> And is the disjoint between the Document's URL and the current entries URL correct?
</I>&gt;<i> If not, what am I missing?
</I>
clearState() was not properly fixed when we changed pushState() and 
replaceState(). I've removed it altogether for now.

&quot;Old title&quot;.

document.title is often used to include things like unread count in a mail 
client or RSS reader. That's orthogonal from the state you would want to 
show in the back button (&quot;Inbox&quot;, &quot;Spam folder&quot;, &quot;Settings&quot;, or whatever).

</I>&gt;<i>

That seems like a bug.

Is the use case above -- where the current title and the title you'd want 
in the history don't match -- provide an adequate use case?
