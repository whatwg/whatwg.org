<PRE>The patch changed something like this:

for (y in canvasHeight) {
  for (x in canvasWidth) {
    putPixel();
  }
}

To something like this:

for (y in roomHeight) {
  for (x in roomWidth) {
    putPixel();
  }
}
for (rooms_y in canvasHeight) {
  for (rooms_x in canvasWidth) {
    putRoom();
  }
}

This pseudo-code is a bit unintelligible, please bear with me.  Basically, there is a fixed number of &quot;rooms&quot; (256px x 256px images), only about 15 in the smaller stages.  The full map might have a total area for 10 x 3 rooms; half of them are duplicated.  The patch caches the rooms drawn, and then &quot;blits&quot; from the cache into the canvas.

this.fgmap used to be one giant canvas.  Now it is an array of smaller canvases (the size of a single room).  The .render() method draws pixels to the associated ImageData in each case (using the four R,G,B,A elements per pixel, as we are discussing).  In this case, cutting down on the number of pixels that this.fgmap.render() needs to poke into ImageData made the overall drawing approximately 2x faster.

It might be important to note that this.fgmap.render() method also does some tile decoding (to convert the SNES tile format into a usable bitmap), and caches the results.

Does that make more sense?  I know it is difficult to follow unfamiliar code, but I would like to clear up any questions you might have.
