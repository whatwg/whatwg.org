FWIW, I felt that having Firefox's default video controls update their 
state for every frame was excessive (and could lead to competing for the 
CPU with the video itself). So, the controls basically ignore timeupdate 
events that occur within .333 seconds of the last timeupdate position... 
Which leads to having a bit of complication to deal with edge cases like 
having the video end less than .333 seconds after the last timeupdate 
event (otherwise the UI might look like stuck shortly before the end of 
the video).

At least for my needs, having an event fire at ~3 Hz (and when special 
things happen, like a seek or the video ending) would be somewhat 
simpler and more efficient.
