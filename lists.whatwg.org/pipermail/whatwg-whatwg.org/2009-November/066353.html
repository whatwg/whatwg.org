I don't think the history.truncate function proposed would be able to affect
other Document object's entries. So for example, if the current history
looks like this:

A1 A2 B1 *B2* B3 B4 C1 C2

Then you can only call history.truncate(1, 2). If you call it with a higher
number in either parameter, then you will get a same origin exception. If
the numbers are smaller though, it would still work. For example, calling
history.truncate(0,1) would leave the following in your history:

A1 A2 B1 *B2* B4 C1 C2

I think this is the usecase clearState is designed for, but it's just not
implemented in a very good way. This would not add a lot of extra work, and
wouldn't complicate it for the user. truncate could also be called with no
parameters, in which case it would clear the entire Document object's
history, similarly to clearState.
