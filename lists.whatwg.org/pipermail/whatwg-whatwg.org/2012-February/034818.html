Doesn't seem like it:

   <A HREF="http://junkyard.damowmow.com/500">http://junkyard.damowmow.com/500</A>

In both cases, unescape() is assuming Win1252, even though in one case 
the encoding is claimed as UTF-8.


&gt;<i> As well as URIs including %-encoded bytes and so forth.
</I>
In both cases here, I see URLs getting interpreted as UTF-8, not based on 
the encoding of the containing page:

   <A HREF="http://junkyard.damowmow.com/501">http://junkyard.damowmow.com/501</A>
   <A HREF="http://junkyard.damowmow.com/502">http://junkyard.damowmow.com/502</A>

My head hurt too much from setting up the previous two tests to actually 
test this.

</I>
I'm happy to consider specific tests. Currently however, it seems like 
Firefox is the only one with any kind of magic involved in determining the 
encoding of javascript: URLs at all, and that magic doesn't seem to have 
as many side effects as one would expect, so I've left it as is.

</I>
That is in fact exactly what the spec requires. The way that we detect 
that the content is &quot;very old / served by old infrastructure&quot; is that it 
lacks a character encoding declaration... :-)

One of the ways I have personally been pushing UTF-8 in the specs is by 
making new formats only support UTF-8.

Indeed.

Quite.

Just configure your server to send back UTF-8 character encoding 
declarations by default, and you don't need to think about it.

That is indeed another terse solution.

It's important not to confuse the default for authors (which is indeed 
ASCII) and the default for browsers (which is a complicated answer, but 
which defines the processing for bytes in the range 0x80-0xFF, which are 
not defined in ASCII). HTML defines both.

I think it puts an undue burden on authors who are just writing small 
files with only ASCII. 7-bit clean ASCII is still the second-most used 
encoding on the Web (after UTF-8), so I don't think it's a small thing.

Assuming you mean for cases where the spec says things like &quot;If encoding 
is a UTF-16 encoding, then change the value of encoding to UTF-8&quot;, then 
any alias of UTF-16, UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE (there aren't any registered 
currently, but &quot;Unicode&quot; might need to be one) would be considered a 
match. It doesn't matter if I refer to you as Henri or hsivonen, in both 
cases we're talking about the same person.

There's also the overrides. The way the spec is written, the &quot;Character 
encoding overrides&quot; are not aliases (at least not in the character 
encoding registry sense). The spec just requires that when you would 
instantiate a Foo decoder or encoder, you instead use a Bar one.

Currently, &quot;iso-10646-ucs-2&quot; is neither an alias for UTF-16 nor an 
encoding that is overridden in any way. It's its own encoding.

Anne's &quot;Encoding&quot; draft may make overrides into aliases. In practice I do 
not believe this will cause any normative change to the behaviour since 
the only time that character encoding identities are compared (as opposed 
being used, where the overrides kick in) is for UTF-8 and UTF-16 
encodings, and those don't have overrides (and hopefully never will).

I hope the above is clear. Let me know if you think the spec is vague on 
the matter.
