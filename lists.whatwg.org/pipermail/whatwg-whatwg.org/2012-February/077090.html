<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The above is just a my proposal in advancing this discussion, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until there is no feedback about this from people on the &quot;RWD Heaven:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if browsers reported device capabilities  in a request header&quot; and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;add html-attribute for &quot;responsive images&quot;&quot; threads, and other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers concerned in Responsive Web Design, I don't think I should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just create the group and hope that the discussion will just move and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concentrate there on its own. So open for feedback on this!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kind regards to all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Viktor
</I>

I&#8217;m certainly not opposed to a more productive venue for hashing out some of these issues, but I still worry that we&#8217;re backtracking. We&#8217;ve already covered a lot of the same ground on this list as a large group of us did months ago ( <A HREF="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/responsive-assets">https://etherpad.mozilla.org/responsive-assets</A> is one of many venues in which this took place ). While I&#8217;m in no way railing against having a bunch of new eyes on this problem and new potential solutions, I&#8217;m afraid of going back and rehashing the same ideas for the sake of people just joining the conversation. By the time we reach a conclusion&#8212;possibly the same conclusion&#8212;and present it to the list again, who&#8217;s to say we wouldn&#8217;t find ourselves repeating the process all over again?

Basically, I&#8217;d want to ensure that any discussion within the group takes place in a very public and easy-to-digest way, so we have an easy reference for people joining the conversation late in the game. I&#8217;d also love to see a representative from each of the big browsers and a couple of people close to the standards process directly involved, so we can stay as focused and productive as possible. I&#8217;m happy to reach out to people, to those ends.

Any way you slice it, you&#8217;re right that this list isn&#8217;t the place for continued discussion of this sort.  Viktor, if you&#8217;re willing to set up such a group, that&#8217;s probably a more appropriate venue&#8212;at least for the time being.
