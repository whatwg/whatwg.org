It is a burden, but it's not significantly difficult or anything.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the list is long or includes anything that it's unreasonable to expect

</I>
The list may well be longer, I haven't checked, but I don't think that  
matters. The resolving URL problem is a bad problem because it means links  
will stop working for users that have a different default encoding, so  
those users leave and go to a competitor site. The form problem is a bad  
problem because it means that the database will be filled with content  
using various different encodings with no knowledge of what is what, so  
when the author realizes this and &quot;fixes&quot; it by declaring the encoding,  
it's already too late, the data is broken and is very hard to repair.

Letting authors get themselves in a situation where they have broken data  
even though it could have been easily prevented seems more like an undue  
burden to me.

Note that both of these features can be hidden in scripts where validators  
currently don't even look, so I think it's not a good idea to make the  
requirement conditional on these features.
