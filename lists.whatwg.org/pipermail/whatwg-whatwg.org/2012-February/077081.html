It's worth keeping in mind that the IE9 mode relevant for quirks &quot;web 
compat&quot; is the compat view quirks mode, as far as I can tell...

&gt;<i> It would be useful if browser implementors could review the draft,

1)  I'm fairly certain the &quot;Images (img elements) without alt attributes 
sometimes display placeholder icons in quirks mode.&quot; quirk cannot be 
dropped.  The real point of that quirk is that this markup:

   &lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;404.html&quot;&gt;

which links to some non-existent image needs to result in a box of width 
100 and height 100 in quirks mode; not doing that breaks all the various 
pages that (still) use &quot;spacer gifs&quot; pointing to bogus URIs.

I believe some UAs have this behavior in all modes; in Gecko the 
behavior is restricted to quirks mode.

2)  The &quot;fixed width specified on a table cell resets the nowrap 
attribute.&quot; quirk seems to be implemented by everyone, effectively.  I 
would be really surprised if it can be dropped.

3)  Likewise for the &quot;tables with no rows/rowgroups have zero height 
even when a height is specified&quot; quirk.

4)  The CSS parsing quirks need to define behavior for shorthands.  How 
was the list of properties for the unitless px quirk generated, by the 
way?  It's interesting that 'font-size' is not in the list....
