&gt;<i> The &lt;blockquote&gt; has been, and will be, rather pointless without
</I>&gt;<i> markup for &#8220;credits&#8221; (indication of author and source, which are
</I>&gt;<i> normally required by law).
</I>
Why do you hate the cite attribute?

&gt;<i> [&#8230;]
</I>
&gt;<i> Seldom does an author wish to quote an entire section. It is not even 
</I>&gt;<i> legal to quote more than is required to fulfill the acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of quoting.
</I>
Elaborate?

&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t think I have ever quoted anything that could sensibly be
</I>&gt;<i> called a section.
</I>
And I don't think I have ever had a need for providing credits that
went beyond having a URI in the cite attribute and a corresponding
hyperlink in the surrounding prose.

&gt;<i> [&#8230;]
</I>
&gt;<i> Wrapping &lt;blockquote&gt; inside &lt;figure&gt; just to be able to present 
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;credits&#8221; as &lt;figcaption&gt; is highly artificial. It is also clumsy, 
</I>&gt;<i> especially considering that it would have to be the *normal* way of 
</I>&gt;<i> presenting a block quotation to satisfy legal requirements.
</I>
May I conjecture that lawyers and judges function almost entirely
unlike markup validators? Also, &#8220;normal&#8221; according to what rulebook?

&gt;<i> If we start from the semantic and logical concept of a quotation,
</I>&gt;<i> then it should be obvious that the element should have a subelement
</I>&gt;<i> for providing source information (&#8220;credits&#8221;), normally at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> the element.
</I>
That would needlessly complicate parsing the contents of a blockquote
element quite a bit. Conceding that there is quite some content there
that is marked up in this (incorrect) way &#8230; why would it not be
&#8220;obvious&#8221; ro have a &#8220;for&#8221; attribute for the cite element?

&gt;<i> The reason why this has not been so from the beginning
</I>&gt;<i> is that &lt;blockquote&gt; was really designed for indentation, though it
</I>&gt;<i> was _named_ after one use for indentation that the designers had in
</I>&gt;<i> their mind. And that&#8217;s how it has been used.
</I>
&lt;<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866#section-5.5.4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866#section-5.5.4</A>&gt; reads different. It
even suggests an alternative presentation style for quotations we are
currently using (prefixing with brackets instead of intendation).

&gt;<i> Since in current usage, &lt;blockquote&gt; means just &#8220;indent&#8221; more often
</I>&gt;<i> than not, browsers and search engines should not and will not imply
</I>&gt;<i> any specific semantics for it. Thus it will be pointless to use it.
</I>
Riveting tale, chap. Can you provide proof? Anecdotally, I could tell
you exactly one site (a forum) that uses blockquote for intendation and
dozens (mostly blogs and wikis) who use it for quotation.

&gt;<i> So leave &lt;blockquote&gt; as legacy markup and recommend it to be used,
</I>&gt;<i> in new documents, only for indentation in rare situations where an
</I>&gt;<i> author much prefers indentation even in the absence of CSS.
</I>
How do you propose to treat legacy content?

&gt;<i> And design markup for quotations so that suits practical needs and
</I>&gt;<i> legal requirements. For this, introduce &lt;quotation&gt; with &lt;src&gt; as a
</I>&gt;<i> subelement
</I>
An alternative might lie in using some kind of framework &#8230; for
description &#8230; of resources! Are you reasonably sure that Dublin Core or
similar vocabularies can not help you with this use case?
