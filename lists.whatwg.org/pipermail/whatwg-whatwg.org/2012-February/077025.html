The logical conclusion is that images are supplied at the highest 
resolution the author sees fit.
It's common to make that a 2x CSS pixel ratio.

Works well for density on items like the iPhone.

Well, I can script things, with javascript. But sure, in CSS it's not 
nice to waste someone's bandwidth.
Nor is it nice to cripple their computer by having it download dozens of 
huge images.

Thumbnailing is really what happens here. Tiling and thumbnailing. 
Common practices.

You're aiming too low on your mobile thumbnails. It's great on a 
resource-constrained pipe, or for a phone that has a 1:1 dpi ratio,
it's not nearly as nice on an iPhone sitting on an unmetered 3G connection.


&gt;&gt;<i> But I'll try to bend my mind around it, now that we're over the initial hurdle about screen size.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, if you want to have something like this, it's not the end of the world:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;style server=&quot;viewport-width, media, min-width&quot; src=&quot;<A HREF="http://server.com/dynamic.css">http://server.com/dynamic.css</A>&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That'd result in some kind of header when requesting that style sheet.
</I>&gt;<i> CSS already has methods for this. We are not talking about CSS. We are

</I>
CSS is the method for HTML to do this work. If we're talking about HTML, 
we're talking about semantics like &lt;article&gt; and &lt;nav&gt;.


&gt;&gt;<i> It could be used for really nasty purposes if it automatically updated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Such as, if you set set &quot;width&quot;, it might re-request the CSS file every time the user resizes the browser.
</I>&gt;<i> This use case was considered and worked around when I developerd

</I>
And by that you mean &quot;the maximum size&quot; at the standard zoom level.

We've got two issues floating here. I'd like to treat them as such. One 
of them is bandwidth preservation. I'm fine using server headers for 
that on various elements.

The other one is just sending CSS media values to the server, so they 
can be processed there instead of processed in CSS media selectors, for 
the purpose of limiting unnecessary fetches based on the CSS results.

Does that sound about right?

If you're solely trying to do &lt;img src=&quot;myThumbnailer.php&quot; /&gt;, I think 
you're overdoing it.
