To prevent being labelled as a troll for questioning the merit of such
ambiguous discussion on WHATWG, I have contacted people for help.
Dominique Haza&#235;l-Massieux, who himself has made proposals on solutions
concerning the topic to the W3C HTML Working Group
(<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011May/0386.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011May/0386.html</A>)
has recommended to me that maybe creating a Community Group at W3C
would be in order. Community Groups differ from Working Groups in that
participants of the discussion are trying to find a common ground for
consensus on what a solution should be to a given problem, before
proposing it for standardization to a standards body.

In my opinion, until everyone is proposing something else (e.g. HTTP
headers, SPDY protocol, &quot;device classes&quot;, new markup with new alt
tags, etc) we create the following CG and move the discussion there:

Proposed name:
Adaptive Media Community Group

Proposed group description:
The Adaptive Media Community Group is a community of web developers
seeking a solution so that embedded media in HTML (e.g. images and
videos using the &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt;), and their properties (e.g.
dimension, compression ratio) are optimum to given factors, such as
device screen resolution or available network bandwidth.

Proposed shortname for CG:
adaptmedia

Of course, creating a CG would be completely meaningless if there is
no interest and support for it from the community. I believe there is
interest for it, but the question is, is there support for it?

The above is just a my proposal in advancing this discussion, and
until there is no feedback about this from people on the &quot;RWD Heaven:
if browsers reported device capabilities &#160;in a request header&quot; and the
&quot;add html-attribute for &quot;responsive images&quot;&quot; threads, and other
developers concerned in Responsive Web Design, I don't think I should
just create the group and hope that the discussion will just move and
concentrate there on its own. So open for feedback on this!

Kind regards to all,
&#160;Viktor
