It'd be nice to have those requirements on the desktop as well! Doesn't this fall into the first bucket?

I'm sympathetic, and I do understand many developers have a goal of using pure-CSS. That said, for the past couple years I've stuck with the concept that onresize and onload are sufficient. Though some hacks are needed to get dpi ratio; on the desktop, Microsoft's window.screen extensions are the only ones to just expose the data in a nice manner.

I think this issue is about a deficiency in HTML markup semantics. I've not had an issue on TV, Handheld and desktop, when I'm scripting.

One slightly related example: big PDF documents. PDF can be loaded in chunks, streamed. I think that Ace (was Bespin) handles chunking of large documents.

We all remember when mobile phones used gateways or otherwise split documents into several pages. It seems relevant to understanding the scope or the problem.
