<PRE>Hello,

as of 2012, some websites are including popular javascript libraries from CDNs, like
Google's. The benefits are:

* Traffic savings for the site operator because the javascript libraries are downloaded from
  the CDN and not from the site that uses them
* If enough sites refer to the same external file, the browser will cache the file and even if
  it's a first visit, the (potentially large) javascript file will not have to be downloaded.

There are however some drawbacks to this approach:

* Security: The site operator is trusting an external site.  If the CDN serves a malicious file
  it will directly lead to code execution in browsers under the domain settings of the site
  including it (a form of cross site scripting).
* Availability: The site depends on the CDN to be available. If the CDN is down the site may not
  be available at all.
* Privacy: The CDN will see requests for the file with HTTP referer headers for every visitor
  of the site.
* Extra DNS lookup if file is not already cached
* Extra HTTP connection (can't use persistent connection because it's a different site) if file is not cached

I am proposing a solution that will solve all these problems, keep the benefits and offers
some extra advantages:

1. The site stores a copy of the library file(s) on its own site.
2. The web page includes the library from the site itself instead of from the CDN
3. The script tag specifies a checksum calculated using a cryptographic hash function.

With this solution, whenever a browser downloads a file and stores it in the local cache, it calculates
its checksum. The browser can check its cache for an (identical) file with the same checksum
(no matter what URL it was retrieved from) and use it instead of downloading the file again.

This suggestion has previously been discussed here ( <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-November/thread.html#7825">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-November/thread.html#7825</A> ), however for a different purpose (file integrity instead of caching identical files from different sites) and I don't feel the points raised back then apply.

If a library is popular, chances are that many sites are including the identical file and it will
already be in the browser's cache. No network access is necessary to use it, improving the users'
privacy. It doesn't matter if the sites store the library file at a different URL. It will always
be identified by its checksum. The cached file can be used more often.

The syntax used to specify the checksum is using the fragment identifier component of a URI
(RFC 3986 section 3.5).

Here's an example using a SHA-256 checksum:

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;jquery-1.7.1.min.js#!sha256!8171413fc76dda23ab32baa17b11e4fff89141c633ece737852445f1ba6c1bd&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

It will not break existing implementations because the fragment is currently ignored for
external javascript files.

The checksum can be used for other html elements as well if other files (style sheets, media files) should
start being used in identical versions on many websites.

There is of course the other interesting use of these checksums (that has previously been discussed on this list):
To make it trivial for the user to check data integrity of downloads (when added to the &lt;a&gt; tag). The MDHashTool already uses this idea: <A HREF="http://mdhashtool.mozdev.org/lfinfo.html">http://mdhashtool.mozdev.org/lfinfo.html</A>

The integrity check could also prove to be a disadvantage:
If a file is modified but the checksum isn't updated in the web page, it will no longer be used (feature, not bug).

I look forward to your comments and suggestions.
