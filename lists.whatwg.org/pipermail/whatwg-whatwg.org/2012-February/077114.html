I think this is like saying that requiring &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; is an undue  
burden on authors who are just writing small files that don't use CSS or  
happen to not be affected by any quirk.

In practice, authors who don't declare their encoding can silence the  
validator by using entities for their non-ASCII characters, but they will  
still get bitten by encoding problems as soon as they want to submit forms  
or resolve URLs with %-escaped stuff in the query component, and so forth,  
so it seems to me authors would be better off if we said that the encoding  
cruft is required cruft just like the doctype cruft.
