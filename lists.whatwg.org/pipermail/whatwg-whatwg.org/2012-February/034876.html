</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The spec as written decides whether a link is a same-resource

</I>
In history traversal, the URLs compared are those of the entries involved. 
However, clicking a link is primarily navigation, not session history 
traversal (though it can involve the latter).


&gt;<i> &gt; Step 6: If the specified entry has a URL whose fragment identifier 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; differs from that of the current entry's when compared in a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case-sensitive manner, and the two share the same Document object, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then let hash changed be true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not clear to me what the current/specified entry's URL is, or where 
</I>&gt;<i> this is properly defined, but earlier, we say:
</I>
Hm, yes, the spec doesn't quite clearly define the URL in all cases. 
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; The current entry is usually an entry for the location of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Document.
</I>
That's a non-normative statement. I've made it more explicitly so.


&gt;<i> and the document's location changes when we call push/replaceState.
</I>
The current entry is whatever the algorithms last set the current entry 
to. I've made that clearer in the spec.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As currently specified, we'll resolve #foo relative to the document's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; original URL; that is, clicking the link will take the user to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; page.html#foo, not page2.html#foo.  But the intent of a link with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; href #foo is clearly to navigate within the current page, not to go 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; somewhere else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Were you saying that this isn't the right interpretation of the spec? 
</I>&gt;<i> Because #foo is resolved relative to the document's base URI, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> the same as the document's original URI, so we decide that #foo is a 
</I>&gt;<i> same-document link?  That's comforting, if it's true.  :)
</I>
When you click a link to &quot;#foo&quot; on a document whose &quot;current address&quot; is 
page2.html but whose &quot;document's address&quot; is &quot;page.html&quot;, then you go 
through these steps:

 - Start the &quot;Follow a hyperlink&quot; algorithm.
 - &quot;Resolve&quot; href relative to the &lt;a&gt; element.
 - This uses XML Base, with the fallback base url being &quot;the document's 
   address&quot;, which is what you were calling &quot;the original URL&quot;.
 - This results in &quot;.../page.html#foo&quot;.
 - &quot;Navigate&quot; to that URL.
 - Step &quot;Fragment identifiers&quot; then compares this URL to &quot;the document's 
   address&quot; (page.html, not page2.html), and finds a match.
 - &quot;Navigating to a fragment identifier&quot; is invoked and creates a new 
   session history entry with the URL &quot;page.html#foo&quot;.
 - &quot;Traverse the history&quot; is then invoked.
 - It sets &quot;the document's current address&quot; to &quot;.../page.html#foo&quot;.
 - Scrolling happens.
 - The &quot;current entry&quot;'s URL is &quot;../page2.html&quot; and the specified entry's 
   URL is &quot;.../page.html#foo&quot; so the fragids differ and hashchange fires.
 - The &quot;current entry&quot; becomes the new specified entry.


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that there are problems with what you describe: what if the new 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URL has a different path, and there are &lt;img&gt; elements whose URLs are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relative, and after pushState() you clone one? Or what about relative 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; links in the original markup? I don't think we can change the base URL 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the fly, all kinds of problems could result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree there are problems with changing the base URI.  But it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> much less intuitive for common use-cases not to change it.  We can 
</I>&gt;<i> change my example above to use ?foo instead of #foo, and I think the 
</I>&gt;<i> same argument applies.  Should a link with href ?foo always resolve 
</I>&gt;<i> relative to the document's original URI (unless the base is explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i> changed)?
</I>
Yes, I'd say so. Otherwise cloning images would break.


&gt;<i> Similarly, if for some bizarre reason the page pushState's to a new 
</I>&gt;<i> directory, shouldn't all the links point relative to that new directory?
</I>
That would break all existing images, stylesheets, scripts, etc, if their 
URLs are reused somehow.


&gt;<i> I kind of think this ship has sailed wrt implementations.  Chrome and 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox both have the same behavior in this respect.  See 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://people.mozilla.org/~jlebar/whatwg/test_pushstate_resolve.html">http://people.mozilla.org/~jlebar/whatwg/test_pushstate_resolve.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> (source included below, since I have a bad habit of deleting these test 
</I>&gt;<i> files right before someone else wants to look at them).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ian, how hard do you think it would be to spec changing the base and 
</I>&gt;<i> resolve the issues with that?
</I>
Changing the base URL would be trivial, but I think it would cause all 
kinds of bad things and isn't what we should do. Consider:

<A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1342">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1342</A>

It doesn't make sense that the second image is broken.

(For some reason in Firefox I get an exception. Not sure if I'm misusing 
the API or if it's a bug in Firefox.)
