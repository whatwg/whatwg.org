Extensions are out of scope, since they don't have to use standard Web 
features.


&gt;<i> 2. Clientside transformations, e.g. Mobify
</I>
I couldn't work out the use case here. Can you elaborate? If it's just 
&quot;make a Web site work for multiple media including handheld and desktop&quot;, 
then it seems like building a multimedia site from the ground up using 
media queries, CSS, and media-aware JS is a far better solution than 
taking a Desktop site and pushing extra JS into it to hack the page to 
work on a mobile device.


&gt;<i> As might be expected, there is at least one use-case for a complementary

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Downloadable fonts - people who want to use custom fonts for drawing in 
</I>&gt;<i> the canvas element need to know when a font has loaded. 'afterload' 
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a good way to know that, since it happens as a side effect of 
</I>&gt;<i> actually using it and fonts don't have an explicit load API like images 
</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>
Seems like the right way to support that is to provide a font loading API, 
not a global loading notification API that you can use to look for font 
URLs.


&gt;<i> Safari and Chrome have already shipped 'beforeload' [...].

Having the mobile device do this sounds like a terrible idea. Surely it 
would be orders of magnitude more effective to have the server do this 
kind of transformation.

I'm not sure I agree it's a good use case to solve, but I definitely agree 
that even if it was, beforeload wouldn't cut it.

</I>
Indeed. In fact, at that point I don't really understand the difference 
between beforeload and the progress-events-suggested &quot;loadstart&quot;, which 
some objects and elements use.

Yeah that's pretty much sufficient for the transformation case...

</I>
Preventing all loads in a document seems trivial. Don't declare any loads! 
I really don't understand why you would include &lt;script&gt; and &lt;img&gt; 
elements, etc, if you're not going to want them to be processed.

(The only exception I can think of is for defining templates or shadow 
trees for segments or components that are going to be stamped out later. 
The Web Components work on &lt;template&gt;s will likely end up providing a 
declarative way to &quot;neuter&quot; parts of a document for that purpose, though.)

I couldn't agree more with the above.

I don't have an objection to adding a cancelable bubbling event that fires 
synchronously as part of the &quot;execute a script block&quot; algorithm, between 
the current steps 1 and 2 of &quot;if the load was successful&quot;, which gets the 
URL of the script, targetted at the script, which if canceled cancels the 
execution of the script.

Does any browser have an event like that already? If not, any opinions on 
an event name? &lt;script onbeforerun=&quot;&quot;&gt;?
