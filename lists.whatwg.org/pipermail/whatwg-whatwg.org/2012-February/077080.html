</I>
Sure. I think however that that has partially already been done as part of  
Hixie writing HTML's Rendering section, and so is probably out of scope  
for this document.

&gt;&gt;<i> It is very likely that more quirks need to be added, but as I went
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the list I was surprised about how many of them were *not*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> widely implemented across browsers, and so may not be needed for Web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compat and can be dropped.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm happy for the spec to be moved somewhere, and I can volunteer to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> edit it, but I can't promise to spend a lot of time on it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be useful if browser implementors could review the draft,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider dropping quirks, give feedback about quirks that can't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dropped, and consider aligning with other implementations for quirks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that are here to stay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd note that there are sometimes messy interactions between
</I>&gt;<i> behaviors.  For example, if my memory is correct, implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 parsing algorithm required that we implement a text-decoration
</I>&gt;<i> quirk that we previously didn't have (but WebKit did), as described
</I>&gt;<i> in <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=572713">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=572713</A> .  (Speaking
</I>&gt;<i> of which, I'm curious why that quirk, on propagation of
</I>&gt;<i> text-decoration into tables, didn't make it from the
</I>&gt;<i> developer.mozilla.org URL you gave into your document.  That makes
</I>&gt;<i> me think the document isn't quite ready for review yet.)
</I>
It's in a comment in the source. I noticed that it was missing in HTML's  
Rendering section and filed a bug.

<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15941">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15941</A>

&gt;<i> There may be cases where only some browsers have a described quirk,
</I>&gt;<i> but other browsers have a different behavior that provides the same
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility.
</I>
Yeah. In such cases, we need to pick one quirk and spec that.

&gt;<i> That said, I agree it's likely that many of the quirks can be
</I>&gt;<i> removed.
</I>
One form of &quot;removing quirks&quot; is to propagate them to also apply in  
standards mode, which is doable if standards mode Web content doesn't rely  
on the quirk being *absent*, and is something the HTML spec has done for  
many things (e.g. parsing of legacy colors).
