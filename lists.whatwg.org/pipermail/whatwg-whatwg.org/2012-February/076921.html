<PRE>The server can not rely on client side *anything* with resource
negotiation. This is because clients now pre-fetch resources; as soon as
the node exists the resource is requested - before any script has had a
chance to run or cookies have been set. It's a tripping point that Filament
Group have written about as well as myself.

I agree that headers are expensive. But are they expensive compared to a
few hundred kilobytes of saved bandwidth because we were able
to successfully negotiate content? That's the thing people keep seeming to
miss. Also, as indicated, with SPDY this is much much less of a problem
than for HTTP.

&quot;More to the point I thin it is clear that developers want to know how to
adapt their content to the user's device&quot;

Absolutely, which is what this is about. There are two use cases - one is
client side and one is server side. They seem to answer the same equation
but they do not. We need both, and we can't do *reliable* sever adaption
without *reliable* client feature-set reporting. Which we can't get any way
we try right now, and there are many approaches tried - JS, cookies, and UA
sniffing. None are bullet-proof, and all are merely ways of attempting to
*Guess* what a browser header could explicitly tell us. Which is why
headers are wanted.

To be honest I think this is more a browser thing than  anything. I don't
see any problem with browsers behaving exactly as they do now, but
listening out for a server response header that in turn requests the
browser to append certain headers with all requests to the domain. I.e.,

1) client asks for <A HREF="spdy://website.com">spdy://website.com</A>
2) server responds with content and adds a &quot;request bandwidth &amp; device
screen size header&quot;
3) client then appends these headers to all future requests on the domain.
4) server can push any amended content from 2) over SPDY without another
request (because SPDY can).

This way there are no additional overheads unless the server has requested
them specifically.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also the approach of knowing what capabilities you have from
