Right. On the other hand, the distinction between tablets and actual PCs
are getting blurry each day. e.g. I used Fujitsu P1510 throughout my
college to take notes during classes. It had 8.9&quot; screen was fully capable
of running Windows XP and Vista to some extent.

But browsing regular websites on that machine was somewhat painful due to
most websites assuming every desktop computer to have at least XVGA or
above. I suspect I might have had a better UX if I could choose to view
tablet-version of websites on my laptop instead (there were iPad back then).

I agree with others on the list who've said that sending across
&gt;<i> resolution (of any kind, be it actual, available or other) is the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> approach, and it will lead to browsers intentionally sending the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> information just to get the content they think they want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
While I do agree with this statement, I have to admit that there are cases
where the screen resolution of a device gives a better hint on how to
layout your website than the type of the device.
