Ah yes, that thread is here currently:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/issues/#New-features--script-element">http://www.whatwg.org/issues/#New-features--script-element</A>

Since the use cases were for new features (as opposed to addressing 
security vulnerabilities, which seem more important), I have been 
deferring it until I get through the bug reports.

So it didn't fall through the cracks, it's still in a bucket. :-)

(Since I've now done half of that thread's requests anyway, and since it's 
gotten implementations already now, I'll fasttrack it.)


&gt;<i> &gt; As noted in the previous e-mail, it's not clear that the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the use case I was talking about, but they'd want at least

</I>
Surely for the style sheets there's far less of a difficulty in getting 
things right? I don't really understand what vulnerability would be 
relevant here such that you'd need per-stylesheet control over what was 
being imported.
