</I>&gt;<i> 1. Typographically accepted changes to a quote, such as changing

</I>
This is now explicitly allowed, with an example.


&gt;<i> 2. Adding quote metadata inline, such as notes and attribution
</I>
This is indeed intentionally non-conforming.


&gt;<i> 3. Adding quote metadata on a line after the block quote, but such that 
</I>&gt;<i> it remains visually associated with the quote
</I>
That's fine, so long as it's not in the &lt;blockquote&gt;, per the spec.


&gt;<i> I&#146;ve found examples of these in the Chicago Manual of Style, web
</I>&gt;<i> pages, and books (on Google Books), and the results are here:
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://oli.jp/example/blockquote-metadata/">http://oli.jp/example/blockquote-metadata/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> These examples are annoying (3) or impossible (2, 1?) to achieve while
</I>&gt;<i> being conformant with the current spec.
</I>
I don't think they're impossible, though I agree they're annoying, in 
particular the attributions inlined into the last paragraph. We should add 
support to CSS to make this kind of thing easier.

</I>&gt;<i> Oli has shown the real-world use cases for attribution *within*

</I>
I think that overstates the case. The real world use cases are for the 
*presentation* having a block-like effect containing both the quote and 
the attribution. However, that's not a use case for the markup; the 
attribution still isn't actually a part of the quote, however it is 
presented.

Presentation issues like this should be solved in CSS, not in HTML, even 
if it may superficially seem easier to fix in HTML. If we just fix things 
using the simplest possible fix rather than the best possible fix, we end 
up with things like &lt;font&gt;, javascript: links, using &lt;blockquote&gt; for 
indentation, document.write(), having bidi control in the presentation 
layer, etc. These were all mistakes, though, I think we'd all agree. They 
led to the Web being harder to maintain, they led to layering violations, 
they led to the technology being harder to explain, etc.

It's important to keep things well-designed, even if it means more 
up-front work in getting the technology created. If CSS was flexible 
enough to address this kind of problem, it would also be flexible enough 
to solve many other problems.

That's not to say that one day we won't provide an explicit way to mark up 
attribution for &lt;blockquote&gt;s in markup, just that the desired 
presentation isn't a relevant concern in doing so (except insofar as it 
may help decide between two otherwise equally good solutions).

I expect we will eventually create a &lt;credit&gt; element that goes inside 
&lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;figure&gt; or &lt;figcaption&gt;, &lt;caption&gt;, and maybe other 
contexts as well. At the moment, I'm deferring adding it so that we can 
see how &lt;figure&gt; and the other new elements do in the wild.

Given registerProtocolHandler(), it would be trivial to do that for an 
isbn: (or web+isbn:) scheme. No need for browser vendors to get involved.

No need, the current markup handles it fine already (as you demonstrate 
above).

Agreed. The only reason I haven't dropped cite=&quot;&quot; is that it doesn't cause 
any harm (unlike, say, longdesc=&quot;&quot;).


&gt;<i> &lt;label for=&quot;input-id&quot;&gt; is a known working and in use pattern.
</I>
It has an effect.


&gt;<i> Thus I feel much more confident advocating use of the parallel:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;cite for=&quot;quote-id&quot;&gt;
</I>
What effect would it have? You just pointed out that a feature with no 
effect is an antipattern. :-)
