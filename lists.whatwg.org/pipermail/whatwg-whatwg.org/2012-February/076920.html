I'm pretty sensitive to Henri's argument that it's easy to add headers we
think will be useful, when they really won't. They are still a pretty
expensive part of the transaction, especially for mobiles.

If you want them anyway, you might like to look at the Device Description
Repository work W3C did, building on the lessons learned from doing CC/PP,
UAProf, WURFL, because &quot;the mobile web [had/was about to] reached the
point where this capability was really important&quot;.

More to the point I thin it is clear that developers want to know how to  
adapt their content to the user's device (rather than trying to adapt the  
user to buy the device they coded for which I think many people here would  
agree is a really bad thing to encourage).

There is also the approach of knowing what capabilities you have from
within the page itself. Again there is a long history of this, including
media queries, the generally loathed hasFeature in DOM and the more common
if (navigator.something) approach that is widely used instead, and so on.
