</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Adaptive images:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To optimize user-experience on smart-phones (most of which have  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relatively small screens, and are on slow connections most of the time)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Be careful with generalizations like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mobile devices can be connected to high-speed networks. Laptops can be  
</I>&gt;<i> tethered via mobile networks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are many permutations of screen size, DPI, zoom, network speed,  
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth cost and memory availability that influence decision what image  
</I>&gt;<i> resolution is best, and it's not as simple as &quot;mobile&quot; vs &quot;non-mobile&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There aren't even clear &quot;device classes&quot;. Basic device characteristics  
</I>&gt;<i> like physical screen size and presence of a hardware keyboard can change  
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Smartphones can be connected to TVs and projectors. Tablets can be  
</I>&gt;<i> connected to keyboards. Laptops can be flipped into tablet mode. Desktops  
</I>&gt;<i> can have touchscreens &#8212; and these aren't obscure things. It's iPad with  
</I>&gt;<i> AirPlay and dock. It's most tablet PCs. You can expect many laptops to  
</I>&gt;<i> have touchscreens soon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mobile&quot; or &quot;smartphone&quot; can mean anything from Opera Mini on GPRS  
</I>&gt;<i> connection to a quad-core 4G smartphones more powerful than desktops were  
</I>&gt;<i> few years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate optimisations you're trying to make, but simply reporting  
</I>&gt;<i> basic capabilities in an HTTP header isn't going to work well in other  
</I>&gt;<i> than few most common cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope we could come up with a better solution that can all the  
</I>&gt;<i> optimisations and improved experience you want to achieve, but doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> have pitfalls of assuming that slow networks and touch screens go  
</I>&gt;<i> hand-in-hand, or that devices with keyboards also have mouse and &lt; 100dpi  
</I>&gt;<i> screen, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Adaptive CSS/Javascript.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CSS has media queries already. New queries can (and I think should) be  
</I>&gt;<i> added to query more capabilities like presence of a touch screen (Mozilla  
</I>&gt;<i> experiments with -moz-touch-enabled media query already).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Media queries are dynamic and can be observed by JavaScript, so when you  
</I>&gt;<i> switch from tablet's own touch screen to an external display, pages could  
</I>&gt;<i> theoretically switch UI too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If server could easily detect device type/capabilities it would have the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ability to tailor aggregated js/css files to a class of a device, thus  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providing greatly improved experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but it doesn't mean that the server has to do that and that it's the  
</I>&gt;<i> only way to do that. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script src=touch-ui.js media=&quot;input-type: touch&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script src=mouse-ui.js media=&quot;input-type: mouse&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (although I'm not suggesting using that form literally, as it has some  
</I>&gt;<i> drawbacks of its own)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next version of JavaScript is going to have modules, which makes loading  
</I>&gt;<i> of JavaScript cleaner than &lt;script&gt;. Perhaps modules could be loaded  
</I>&gt;<i> conditionally based on media-query-like declarations?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

I can't remember where right now, but I do recall seeing an article
which said that it was a common misconception that mobile devices were
most often on a slow connection. Personally, I tend to make most use of
my mobile for browsing when I'm on a wireless connection. Just because
someone is using a mobile device, it doesn't naturally mean they are on
the move.
