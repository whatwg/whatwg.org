</I>&gt;<i> Well you're never _required_ to. The client can always use the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The point was that it's inconvenient for users to name downloaded files by
hand; it's something that should be done for them in the overwhelming
majority of cases.

Correct. That's intentional. If a victim server doesn't explicitly say
&gt;<i> that the resource is an attachment, then we don't want to allow a hostile
</I>&gt;<i> server to trick the user into downloading the file at all. It's not so
</I>&gt;<i> much that the server can't specify the filename, so much as you can't say
</I>&gt;<i> that the file should be downloaded in the first place. It should show a
</I>&gt;<i> warning and let the user select the filename.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why?  No new security issues have been suggested, as far as I recall, in
allowing links that trigger downloads cross-origin.

&gt;<i> Your suggested workaround for the PDF case is to have two links, but in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to do that cross-origin you'd need to add &quot;Content-Disposition:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attachment&quot; on the file, so that wouldn't work: they'd both become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download links.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'd have to have two different URLs, one for inline embedding, and one
</I>&gt;<i> for downloading, just as you do today without download=&quot;&quot;. This is
</I>&gt;<i> intentional. You shouldn't be able to force a download cross-origin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why not?

&gt;<i> Similarly, sites show an image inline and have a separate link to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download it.  For that link to use @download, C-D: attachment would have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be applied to the images, which is clearly unwanted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only if the image is cross-origin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
On nontrivial sites, download links are *usually* cross-origin (eg.
resources hosted on services like S3).

&gt;<i> This breaks every case where I've wanted this functionality in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't make sense for @download to only work on files which are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already marked as such by Content-Disposition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It works on same-origin files also, regardless of their C-D state.
</I>

Every time I've wanted to do this, it was cross-origin.

&gt;<i> If you really want cross-origin @download to be opt-in, then use a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate header for it (&quot;Allow-Forced-Downloads: *&quot;); don't repurpose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C-D like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not repurposing, it's just using it for a case where before there
</I>&gt;<i> would be a download but no given filename: now there can be a filename
</I>&gt;<i> given in the markup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's repurposing Content-Disposition by using it to say &quot;this resource opts
into allowing cross-origin sites to specify filenames using @download&quot;.
It's strange, and doesn't allow specifying filenames for C-D: inline, which
is also important.

If you really think that allowing sites to trigger downloads and set
filenames cross-origin has security issues, then use a separate header like
&quot;Allow-Forced-Downloads&quot; to make that statement; don't derive it from C-D.
(But I don't know what security problem that is.)

We're not trying to figure out who's to blame, we're trying to prevent
&gt;<i> there from being anyone to blame in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Anyone can already have links that go straight to a download, with
Content-Disposition: attachment.  The only issue that was raised here, as
far as I recall, is the possibility that if such a link contains malicious
content, this *might* make it appear that the blame for that content is on
an innocent third-party.  There are no *new* security issues, only the
potential for the blame for an existing one to be on the wrong party, and I
think that's a solvable UI problem.

I don't understand the relevance of rel=attachment (what is it?).
&gt;<i>
</I>
The &quot;rel=attachment&quot; proposal is to treat the link as if it has a
&quot;Content-Disposition: attachment&quot; header.  Specifying the default filename
would be a separate attribute (and would apply to manual save-as downloads
as well).
