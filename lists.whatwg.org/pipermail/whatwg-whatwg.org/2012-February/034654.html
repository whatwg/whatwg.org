It's very probable that a &quot;mobile&quot; or &quot;tablet&quot; screen will be zoomed in 
various ways.  People do this all the time.

&gt;<i> A typical thing that people want to do is to deliver and display *less*

This assumes that the entire page is onscreen at once, which is a pretty 
bad assumption for said scenarios.

I feel like I must be missing something pretty fundamental here.  Either 
said &quot;people&quot; are assuming users never use zoom-and-pan type controls on 
their devices or there's something more complicated going on.  What am I 
missing?

&gt;<i> I am sympathetic to the view that it would be desirable to be able to minimise the cost

</I>
Sure.  I'm not entirely sure how sympathetic I am to the need to produce 
&quot;reduced-functionality&quot; pages...  The examples I've encountered have 
mostly been in one of three buckets:

1) &quot;Why isn't the desktop version just like this vastly better mobile one?&quot;
2) &quot;The mobile version has a completely different workflow necessitating 
a different url structure, not just different images and CSS&quot;
3) &quot;We'll randomly lock you out of features even though your browser and 
device can handle them just fine&quot;
