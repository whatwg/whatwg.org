Right.  When I had a smart phone, it was on WiFi 90%+ of the time because
I'm either at work or at home although I browsed on the phone when I was on
move disproportionally more than I was at work or home.

I appreciate optimisations you're trying to make, but simply reporting
&gt;<i> basic capabilities in an HTTP header isn't going to work well in other than
</I>&gt;<i> few most common cases.

I'm totally with you. While I do sympathize with the view that we need some
ways to let servers figure out which resource to be sent and how it should
be sent, I don't think web developers should be making such decisions
solely based on the types of devices they're serving.

On the other hand, mobile networks tend to have a huge variance on the
packet loss rate (sometimes 100% if the user is moving into an elevator)
and websites need to behave differently, e.g. cache more images on Map app.

On that note, it might be more useful to add a header indicating that
they're on slow network, mobile network, and such although it might be
better for servers to auto-detect latency and bandwidth for that kind of
use cases.
