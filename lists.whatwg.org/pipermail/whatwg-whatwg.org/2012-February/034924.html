Yes. Similarly, some browsers might provide spelling checking, and others 
might not. Some might support tabbing from field to field, others might 
not. The thing is, if a platform does not have the concept of implicit 
submission, presumably the user wouldn't try to implicitly submit anything 
in the first place, so it doesn't matter if the browser does it or not.


&gt;&gt;<i> The guidelines in the spec do not say anything about the behaviour

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though, so I don't see any reason to consider the visibility of a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> button in making the decision as to which button is the default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second to your opinion, on the last line of the specs paragraph it says

</I>
This does not contradict what I wrote. It just says what to do if there IS 
an implicit submission mechanism, but there's no button at all.

That's non-conforming currently.


&gt;<i>    - Two text fields with one display:none submit button
</I>
That's not really sensible, but it was technically within the spec's 
language. (You were allowed to not pick a default button if there was one 
to pick from but you didn't like it for some reason.) I've changed the 
spec to make this no longer allowed. The first button will now always be 
the default.


&gt;<i> Given that WebKit implicitly submits form even in the presence of a 
</I>&gt;<i> visible submit button or an invisible submit button (visibility: hidden, 
</I>&gt;<i> or display: none with exactly one text field), I don't see why we should 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid implicit submission only when there are multiple form controls and 
</I>&gt;<i> a display:none submit button.
</I>
Agreed.

</I>
If you submit with one text field and no button, then you are required to 
also submit with two text fields and no button. So this is non-conforming.

</I>&gt;<i> In summary, Firefox special cases one text field (can have checkbox,

Those seem non-conforming for the same reason.

Do you have any links to pages that break if a form with more than one 
text field supports implicit submission?


&gt;<i> Furthermore, a requirement for web compat is that in the two-textfield

</I>&gt;<i> be surprised if that's why WebKit has it too.
</I>
The spec tried to say this, though it did so poorly. It now definitely 
says this.


&gt;<i> For the one-text-input case, as I recall IE does NOT click the default 
</I>&gt;<i> submit, at least as of 2002; Gecko used to have that behavior but we 
</I>&gt;<i> opted for more consistency.  So the current Gecko behavior is to submit 
</I>&gt;<i> via clicking the default submit input if there is one, else to submit 
</I>&gt;<i> only if there is only one text control (where the definition of &quot;text 
</I>&gt;<i> control&quot; is especially interesting, since it of course includes controls 
</I>&gt;<i> of unknown types, so as new form control types are added things get 
</I>&gt;<i> _really_ exciting before browsers implement them).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Submitting forms with no submit on enter in a single text control is 
</I>&gt;<i> also required for web compat, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is also the separate issue of _which_ controls enter triggers 
</I>&gt;<i> submission in (e.g. it works in checkbox or radio in Gecko, iirc, but of 
</I>&gt;<i> course not in textarea).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those who want to mess with the spec for this behavior, 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99920">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99920</A> and

</I>
I read those bugs, but can't see the reason why submitting a form with two 
text fields and no buttons would break the Web. Can you elaborate?

Technically, if you have a button, you could arbitrarily pick the default 
from the buttons you have, including picking no button, and the spec put 
no limit on what you based the decision on.

I've now changed this since it allowed different behaviours unnecessarily.


&gt;<i> (It also explicitly says that if implicit submit is supported but

</I>
Do you have any such pages to point to?

The semantics of the page don't change though.

(Opacity:0.01 and margin-left:-100em would both also look the same, but 
presumably you don't think those shouldn't submit.)

Whether it does or not should be based on the conventions of the platform.

Really? I've always found it annoying that I have to hunt for the submit 
button. I don't have to in Windows dialogs, why do I have to on Web pags 
in Windows browsers? Doesn't make any sense.

The spec agrees with you. If there's a button, and it's the default, then 
if it is disabled the form won't submit. If there's a button and it's not 
the default, the form wouldn't submit either. So if there's a button and 
it's disabled, you should not be able to implicitly submit, per the spec.

I agree with Boris here.

I've changed the spec to be clearer that CSS cannot be taken into account 
when determining the default. The default button is just always the first 
submit button in the form.
