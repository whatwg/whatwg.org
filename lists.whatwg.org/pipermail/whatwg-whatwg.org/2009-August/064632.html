Yes, but we hate those prompts, don't you?

I'd love it if HTML5 took on a standard means of 'blessing' things. Thus far
every time we come even close to the notion of 'installing' something... it
doesn't go well in this forum.

Interesting... I think you just described a way to 'bless' things by
alluding to 'important' repositories and trying to put something in them.
There are probably other ways to express this too that wouldn't involve
altering  the storage APIs... i'd prefer to pursue things in a more modular
fashion... jmho.
