The idea of tying the notification spec to a particular brand of storage
seems like a bad idea...especially at this point in time.

I definitely like the idea of string based notifications.  And I like the
idea of having a fairly constrained form of updating state on the machine.

It seems like these are things UAs and Moore's law can address.  For
example, what if the UA was smart enough to cache compiled JavaScript
(obviously with very smart invalidation routines...or even hooked into
AppCache!).  Sure, it's not easy, but there still seems to be a lot of
head-room here.

Also keep in mind that lots of web applicaitons think they're pretty
important.  Sure, giving gmail .1% of your system memory seems worth it.
 But how do you draw the line?  What if I have 10 apps that want to do this?
 (Say...the top 10 sites on the internet.)  Well, now I've just given up 1%
of my ram.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; SharedWorkers are overloaded to provide a way for pages under the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; domain to share state, but this seems like an orthogonal goal to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; cleaner solution had we decided to address the &quot;shared state&quot; issue via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a separate mechanism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shared state is addressed by the Web Storage and Web Database features;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shared workers are intended to provide shared computation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, although I'd say that &quot;persistent storage is addressed by the Web
</I>&gt;<i> Storage and Web Database features&quot;. Shared state is also addressed, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's not the primary goal. If I have a tree of objects that I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> share between two pages, telling me to serialize it into name/value string
</I>&gt;<i> pairs, write it into Web Storage, and then have the remote side read it out
</I>&gt;<i> is not a satisfying (or performant) solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Which use case is this related to?  If the shared worker is creating UI
elements for the page, then composing HTML and sicking it into a div's
.innerHTML is actually (sadly) the fastest way to go at the moment.  Besides
that, I can't think of why you'd have some huge tree of information for the
gmail use case.


&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm somewhat leery of the &quot;canned RSS-feed&quot;-style solution to
</I>&gt;<i> notifications (our vision for notifications is that they are scriptable and
</I>&gt;<i> more interactive than just a dumb text + icon).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What if the notification could have embedded links?  If you make them too
powerful, you'll definitely see spam/ads/phishing/etc showing up in them.

What don't you like about XMPP?
