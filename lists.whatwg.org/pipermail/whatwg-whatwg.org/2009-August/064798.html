I was under the impression that the idea was that this wouldn't be
necessary.  Sites should be free to use localStorage as they use
cookies, transparently without annoying the user with spammed pop-ups.
 Does any browser currently require user approval for localStorage by
default, or plan to?

&gt;<i> That does not mean that the &quot;Delete Cookies&quot; menu command should also delete

</I>&gt;<i> to do this with Google websites several times). Conflating the two can lead
</I>&gt;<i> to disasters like &quot;I told you to delete my COOKIES! Not my EMAIL DRAFTS that
</I>&gt;<i> I was trying to log in to send!&quot;
</I>
I entirely agree with this, as a user.  Browsers should expose the
option to clear cookies and localStorage separately.  Currently
Chrome's &quot;Clear Browsing Data&quot; has a separate checkboxes for browsing
history, download history, cache, cookies, saved passwords, and saved
form data.  I'd expect it to add another checkbox for localStorage,
not change &quot;cookies&quot; to &quot;cookies and localStorage&quot;.

Although in any event, I'm not sure what good UI would be to say &quot;This
might destroy valuable data, but probably not most of it, and whether
it destroys the particular bit of data you're thinking of really
depends on if the app happens to store it locally or on its servers,
and if on its servers, whether it's pushed out this data yet or not.&quot;

</I>
I don't think that the ones using Flash LocalStorage to track users
will ever switch to a standards-based solution.  Anything implemented
by the browser vendors will allow users to easily clear it, which
defeats their goal.  What HTML 5 needs to do is supplant Flash's
*site-critical* functions.  If Flash is relegated to only things like
tracking methods, it would be feasible for it to just not be
installed, and users wouldn't care.  Do site-critical Flash apps
(i.e., ones where the user would say the site is broken if they didn't
work) often rely heavily on localStorage persistence?
