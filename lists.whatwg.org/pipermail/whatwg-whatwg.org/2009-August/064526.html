</I>
There are many sites that use server-side checks for those purposes.
For instance, almost any site running the popular vBulletin forum
software imposes a minimum length on posts.  I don't know if many
sites do client-side checks, but I'd imagine more would if it were
easier.

I should say that I can't see myself personally using pattern on textareas.

&gt;<i> If so, would the checks be easier to write using a pattern attribute
</I>&gt;<i> than they currently are?
</I>
Yes.  For instance, checking for a minimum length of 10 characters is
just pattern=&quot;.{10,}&quot;.  Currently you'd have to do . . . I don't even
know offhand.  My JavaScript isn't good enough.  I'd have to spend
some time with online references to figure it out.  Almost every web
developer is very familiar with regex; not every web developer knows
much JS.  On the other hand, anyone who can write a JavaScript event
handler offhand can definitely handle pattern=&quot;&quot;.

I've recently been adding HTML 5 form features to MediaWiki, and found
that I was using features that I'd never have considered figuring out
the right JS for, because it was so simple.  For instance, MediaWiki
currently uses JavaScript to autofocus forms on only a couple of
pages.  When I saw that the autofocus attribute was available and
worked in a few significant browsers, I started adding it to every
single page where it made sense -- which means most form-based pages.
Also things like type=number that we just relied on server-side
validation for.  Just because authors aren't currently going to the
trouble of writing JS doesn't mean they wouldn't use easier methods if
they were available.

There's no minlength, though.
