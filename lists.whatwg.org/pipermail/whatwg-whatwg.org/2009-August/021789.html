<PRE>
With Arun's announcement of a stable File API spec [1], I have now updated 
HTML5 to handle the use cases listed below.

I've just added input.files to handle this case.

I think it is reasonable for a UA to only notice a selected file has 
disappeared in an asynchronous fashion.

</I>
I've added dataTransfer.files to the drag-and-drop interface.

I'm not sure how to expose the presence of data during the drag, though.

</I>
The way it's ended up, if the author specifies &lt;input type=file multiple&gt;, 
the user can pick as many files as he desires from that one control.

Also, the user can drag and drop files either directly onto an &lt;input 
type=file&gt; in which case it sets the file selection, or onto something 
that a script can then grab the files from.

</I>&gt;<i> would this allow or not my poor old broken mini-app to re-emerge from 
</I>&gt;<i> the dead?
</I>
Scripts can't access the local file system, no.

Rather than making Storage support only DOMString and File, I've made 
Storage just support the same kinds of structures that we can post through 
postMessage():

That includes File. I've explicitly excluded ImageData since it has a sync 
reading API and typically lots of data, and that would be a perf issue.

I ended up doing what IE8 does here, which, while rather suboptimal in 
many ways, has the advantage of being compatible with a variety of pages 
that do stupid things with &lt;input type=file&gt; as well as being relatively 
secure in not exposing the path.

I don't think it makes sense to have this be preference-based.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I understand the possible risk of exposing a path name of the

This is now possible using the File API and the special scheme for 
accessing files anonymously.

Fixed. (It returns the first filename.)

</I>
The spec doesn't preclude it, but it doesn't require that it be possible, 
either. This is more of a UI issue than something that affects interop, as 
far as I can tell.


&gt;<i> If it should be possible, but a Web author wants to prevent it in a case

</I>&gt;<i> reliable when that doesn't include the path.
</I>
I expect when &quot;only distinct files make sense&quot; that it's more the contents 
that are the concern, not the source on the filesystem. (e.g. why would 
the same file twice be a problem but the same file twice via different 
hardlinks not be?)

</I>&gt;<i> An author might provide the filenames in a more friendly and readable

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> For example, you can browse to .wav files and add them to a select

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of Audio(), you might load theora videos and play them with the 
</I>&gt;<i> VideoLan plugin or load wmv files and play them with WMP.
</I>
All these use cases are now handled by .files.

Done, as mentioned above.
