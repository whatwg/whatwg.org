</I>If you say the HTML5 draft should be split to many smaller parts, I 
agree. We need to be able to say that some feature is stable i.e.
recommendation. Without stability it is pretty awkward to implement
anything, IMO
Currently there is the draft where one can just guess the stability of
the features.

HTML5 should contain just the core features of the web platform.
Everything else should go to some other specifications.
Also, I believe splitting the spec would make it more readable.
