I've made the &quot;types&quot; list visible during all the events, but I'm 
skeptical about making everything available. We'll probably revisit this 
in a few years when we have a test suite for this. (I probably need to 
rewrite the way this section is written before making any more significant 
changes.)


&gt;<i> 2nd proposal during the dragover event:
</I>&gt;<i> Access to the readonly attribute 'types' of the dataTransfer object 
</I>&gt;<i> should always be granted during a dragover event to allow the potential 
</I>&gt;<i> target element to response accordingly. The current spec doesn't allow a 
</I>&gt;<i> potential target element to decide during a dragover event based on the 
</I>&gt;<i> dragged data if it wants to accept a potential drop of that data or not. 
</I>&gt;<i> It always has to accept potential drops by preventing the default 
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour of the &quot;dragover&quot; event even if it can't process the data 
</I>&gt;<i> during a &quot;drop&quot; event. This can give the wrong indication to the user of 
</I>&gt;<i> the user agent if it turns out the element can't process the data when 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;drop&quot; event gets fired.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously it makes a lot of sense from a security perspective to
</I>&gt;<i> restrict the access to the dataTransfer object during a potentially
</I>&gt;<i> meaningless &quot;dragover&quot; event. However some indication on what type the
</I>&gt;<i> data is should be given during the &quot;dragover&quot; event. The best compromise
</I>&gt;<i> I believe would be to allow exclusive and read only access to the
</I>&gt;<i> 'types' attribute of the dataTransfer object so that it can find out of
</I>&gt;<i> what type the data is which can be potentially dropped upon it. All
</I>&gt;<i> current implementations don't transfer any sensitive or confidential
</I>&gt;<i> data in the types attribute. And obviously by definition of the current
</I>&gt;<i> spec the 'types' attribute is not meant to be used for user data as it
</I>&gt;<i> has to be used to specify the data types exlusively. Maybe to discourage
</I>&gt;<i> abuse of the types attribute the length of each item should be limited
</I>&gt;<i> as well as the characters it can hold. For instance I don't think it
</I>&gt;<i> should accept any newline or linebreak characters.
</I>
I've done this, though without the suggested restrictions.
