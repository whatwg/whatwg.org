A feature that is not widely supported is a feature we authors can't
depend on.  If we're lucky, we can put in some extra effort to work
around the lack and still deliver a decent experience.  If we're not,
we simply don't do what we wanted, or deliver something inferior that
relies on technologies we *can* rely on.

The idea behind pushing something to the next version is that it gives
implementors time to catch up to the spec and converge on what they
support.  This is good for people like me.  ^_^

In the meantime, there's certainly nothing preventing someone from
exploring an idea.  The fact that it won't make it into a spec *yet*
doesn't mean you can't still discuss and refine it, or implement test
versions of it in js, or anything else.
