<PRE>I would much rather have a well thought-out local filesystem proposal, than
continued creep of the existing File and Local Storage proposal. These
proposals are both designed from the perspective of &quot;I want to take some
existing data and either put it into the cloud or make it available
offline&quot;. They don't really handle the use case of &quot;I want to create new
data and save it to the local filesystem&quot;, or &quot;I want to modify existing
data on the filesystem&quot;, or &quot;I want to maintain a virtual filesystem for my
application, and potentially map in the existing filesystem&quot; (e.g. if I'm
flickr and I want to be able to read the user's &quot;My Photos&quot; folder, send
those up, but also make thumbnails that I want to save locally and don't
care if they get uploaded, maintain an index file with image metadata /
thumbnails / ... locally, save off some intermediate files, ...
For this, I would really like to see us take another look at
<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/fileio/fileIO.htm">http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/fileio/fileIO.htm</A> (I don't think this spec is
exactly what we need, but I like the general approach of &quot;origins get a
virtual filesystem tucked away that they can use, they can
fread/fwrite/fseek, and optionally if they want to interact with the host FS
they can request that and then get some sub-set of that (e.g. &quot;my documents&quot;
or &quot;my photos&quot;) mapped in.

&gt;<i> [This is a spin-off of &quot;Web Storage: apparent contradiction in spec&quot;. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> starting a new thread to make a specific proposal.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that where possible we should find a way to do things without
</I>&gt;<i> adding Mother-may-I dialog boxes. But I also believe we need some user
</I>&gt;<i> interaction to enable a site to store nontrivial amounts of permanent local
</I>&gt;<i> data, to avoid Linus's griefer scenario. Conundrum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe the user interaction can be made to fit into existing familiar
</I>&gt;<i> workflows. In a traditional document-based UI, the app prompts the user with
</I>&gt;<i> a standard Save dialog box when it needs to create a new data storage area
</I>&gt;<i> (a &quot;file&quot;). A default name and location are filled in, but the user can
</I>&gt;<i> customize, or of course hit Cancel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not re-use that same model for HTML5 local storage? After all, we know
</I>&gt;<i> the data is going to end up in the filesystem, so why not let the user pick
</I>&gt;<i> where to put it? This way every web-app gets a separate local file.
</I>&gt;<i> Internally it's probably a sqlite database or DBM file or whatever, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's unimportant. The user follows the age-old save-a-file workflow to
</I>&gt;<i> create one, so s/he is in control of whether it's created and where it goes.
</I>&gt;<i> It gets backed up along with the user's other data. The user can trash it
</I>&gt;<i> later on to make room or for privacy purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's what a typical scenario might look like:
</I>&gt;<i> Ellen tells me about a great online animation program. I go to its site,
</I>&gt;<i> and it puts up a Canvas and a bunch of snazzy drawing tools, so I start
</I>&gt;<i> sketching frames of an animation. (Behind the scenes, the app is storing my
</I>&gt;<i> drawings in session storage. This is considered temporary, so the browser
</I>&gt;<i> gives it a reasonable quota without any user interaction.)
</I>&gt;<i> After a while I decide I want to keep using the app, and the stuff I've
</I>&gt;<i> drawn has potential, so I decide to save it to disk. I click the Save
</I>&gt;<i> button, and the site (actually the browser) puts up a standard Save dialog
</I>&gt;<i> box. (Behind the scenes the JS code is writing a value to persistent local
</I>&gt;<i> storage, and since no storage exists yet for its domain, the browser is
</I>&gt;<i> prompting the user.)
</I>&gt;<i> The dialog's prompt is something like &quot;Save SooperAnimator.com data as:&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and the initial destination is &quot;~/Documents/Web Documents/SooperAnimator.com
</I>&gt;<i> Data&quot;. I hit Enter and my animation is saved. (Behind the scenes the browser
</I>&gt;<i> created a new local-storage file at that location, and remembered where it
</I>&gt;<i> put it.)
</I>&gt;<i> Next month I remember that animation in progress and go back to the site.
</I>&gt;<i> My work appears just the way I left it. (The site's script accessed its
</I>&gt;<i> persistent storage, so the browser looked up where it put the file and
</I>&gt;<i> opened it.) I do some more work on it; this time as I save (or maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> auto-saves) the data gets written to the storage file without any more
</I>&gt;<i> interaction because the file already exists.
</I>&gt;<i> Next year I've switched allegiance to UltraAnimate.com, so while cleaning
</I>&gt;<i> house I go through my Web Documents folder, see the old &quot;SooperAnimator.com
</I>&gt;<i> Data&quot; file, and trash it to save disk space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to end up as a combination of the local storage API with some of
</I>&gt;<i> the behavior of the filesystem access proposal (which to be honest I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> read yet.) In essence the entire local storage object space is implemented
</I>&gt;<i> as a key-value DB file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this seem reasonable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8212;Jens
