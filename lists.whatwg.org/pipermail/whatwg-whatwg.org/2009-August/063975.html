I agree that @cite is rarely used as anything other than a URI; I was
attempting to demonstrate that even very recent uses of HTML don't
necessarily &quot;get&quot; that it is for URIs (the site I referenced launched
last month, as I recall).

</I>&gt;<i> few, actually much fewer than I had remembered from my last look at the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I actually took this information the other way, that there are indeed
other uses for &lt;cite&gt; out there beyond titles.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A new element wouldn't work in legacy UAs, so it wouldn't be as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My preference would be for &lt;cite&gt; to retain the flexibility it has in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pre-HTML5 specifications, which would include referencing titles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The flexibility doesn't seem as useful as limiting it to titles. What is
</I>&gt;<i> the problem solved by allowing names to be marked up in the same manner as
</I>&gt;<i> titles? The problem solved by allowing titles specifically to be marked up
</I>&gt;<i> is that titles are usually typographically offset from the surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> text in a distinctive fashion. This doesn't apply to names. Reusing the
</I>&gt;<i> same element for both encourages authors to use &lt;cite&gt; for both which
</I>&gt;<i> makes it harder for them to get the right typographic effect, leading to a
</I>&gt;<i> lower quality of typography overall. I think this is a bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is not just about names. It allows other (non-title) text to be
identified as a citation. If &lt;cite&gt; is identified as &quot;title of work,&quot;
you can't cite many major orchestral arrangements at all, nor can you
cite legal decisions. Unless by &quot;title of work&quot; you mean &quot;standard
citation for an item, usually its title&quot;; but then &lt;cite&gt; really means
what it is defined as in the HTML 4.01 specification.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If backwards compatibility is that big a concern, why does HTML5 use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;legend&gt; outside of &lt;fieldset&gt; elements?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were no existing elements that could be reused for many of the new
</I>&gt;<i> semantics. When there were, we used them (e.g. &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, &lt;menu&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;legend&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that there aren't always existing elements for the new
semantics included in HTML5, but I don't believe that backwards
compatibility is as big a concern as you claim it is. HTML5's re-use
of &lt;legend&gt;, for example, is completely broken in every extant
browser. (See &lt;<A HREF="http://html5doctor.com/legend-not-such-a-legend-anymore/">http://html5doctor.com/legend-not-such-a-legend-anymore/</A>&gt;
for evidence).

Besides, there's already &lt;tt&gt;, which could be used to identify &quot;title
text&quot; or something like that.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What is the pressing need for an element for citations, which would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; require that we overload &lt;cite&gt; with two uses?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A title can be a citation, but not all citations are titles. What's the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pressing need for limiting &lt;cite&gt; only to titles?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As described above, the need to have an element for titles is that there
</I>&gt;<i> are typographic conventions that apply to titles. What is the pressing
</I>&gt;<i> need for an element for citations, which would require that we overload
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; with two uses?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I have said previously, there aren't consistent typographic
conventions that apply to titles. The &quot;pressing need&quot; is that &lt;cite&gt;
is already used to define citations. There's no reason to limit it to
a subset of citation (more below).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But why does that have value? How would you use this information?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
To collect citation information. I don't see how that as any less
value that collecting titles of works, especially since not all works
have titles or means of reference that would constitute a conventional
&quot;title.&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Note that HTML5 now has a more detailed way of marking up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; citations, using the Bibtex vocabulary. I think this removes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; need for using the &lt;cite&gt; element in the manner you describe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Since this is supposed to be the case, why shouldn't HTML5 just ditch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;cite&gt; altogether? (Aside from &quot;backward compatibility,&quot; which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; beside the point of the question.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Backwards compatibility (with legacy documents, which uses it to mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;title of work&quot;) is the main reason.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd beg to differ, regarding &quot;legacy documents.&quot; See, for example the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automated citation generation at Wikipedia:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_templates">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_templates</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What specifically am I looking for here? This doesn't seem to have any
</I>&gt;<i> relevance to HTML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Wikipedia automatically wraps citations in the &lt;cite&gt; element. View
source on any of the Example sections.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition, the comments at zeldman.com use &lt;cite&gt; to reference authors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of comments. While that specific example is younger than HTML5, this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; merely an example of a relatively common use-case for &lt;cite&gt; that does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not use it to signify &quot;title of work.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, the most common use of &lt;cite&gt; is to mark up italics. I agree
</I>&gt;<i> entirely that it's misused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I haven't said that it's misused. I apologize that you have
misunderstood me. I have repeatedly and consistently contended that
&lt;cite&gt; should be used for more than just titles. I believe that
Zeldman's use is perfectly appropriate and correctly used.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blog commenters don't need to be marked up any differently than the number
</I>&gt;<i> of the comment -- that's a stylistic issue that varies from blog to blog.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see the need for an element specifically for people commenting on
</I>&gt;<i> blogs. In most blogs that I've seen, the name isn't even highlighted in
</I>&gt;<i> any particular fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, this isn't just about citing people or &quot;blog commenters&quot;; this
was just an example of a current, non-title, and correct use of &lt;cite&gt;
according to current specifications. (And why does it matter if
something is particularly highlighted? Is HTML supposed to be a
presentational language? Why limit &lt;cite&gt; to the place of a
presentational element?)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Existing tools that treat &lt;cite&gt; exclusively as &quot;title of work&quot; do so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; against every HTML specification out there (i.e., HTML 4.01 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; earlier).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Existing tools generally have had very few problems in finding ways to do
</I>&gt;<i> things against every HTML specification out there. Over 90% of all content
</I>&gt;<i> on the Web is syntactically invalid in some way, and I'm sure that more
</I>&gt;<i> than 10% of content on the Web is generated by tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, and one of those tools is Wikipedia, which wraps entire citations
in the &lt;cite&gt; element, not just titles. It correctly follows current
HTML specifications in using &lt;cite&gt; to identify a citation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all titles are citations, actually. For example, I've heard of the
</I>&gt;<i> /Pirates of Penzance/, but I'm not citing it, just mentioning it in
</I>&gt;<i> passing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, that actually is a citation, whether you realize it or not. You
are making reference to a musical and are therefore citing it, even in
passing.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Indeed, there is a lot of misuse of the element -- as alternatives for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;q&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and HTML5's meaning of &lt;cite&gt;, in particular.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Expanding it to cover the meanings of &lt;q&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, and &lt;em&gt; doesn't seem as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; useful as expanding it just to cover works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe you mean &quot;limiting it just to cover works&quot; here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I meant expanding it, since not all titles of works are citations.
</I>
Any reference to a title of a work is by definition a citation.
Therefore you are limiting &lt;cite&gt; to a subset of citation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a first approximation, titles are italics, and names are not. I think
</I>&gt;<i> that's a far closer approximation of typographical conventions than
</I>&gt;<i> lumping titles and names together into one default style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This doesn't seem to be an issue for you with the reuse of &lt;legend&gt; in
another context, even though it is broken. So why is it an issue here?
(And again, titles are not always in italics.)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't changed the spec. I continue to hold the position that covering
</I>&gt;<i> titles of works is more useful than covering titles of works and names of
</I>&gt;<i> people, and more useful than covering only names of people or works that
</I>&gt;<i> are explicitly cited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You are misconstruing my argument. This isn't about including names of
people; that is just the most obvious non-title form of citation. This
is about properly understanding what a citation can be and writing the
specification for the &lt;cite&gt; element to account for those
possibilities. Citations are references to works, people, etc. By
limiting it to &quot;title of work&quot; you are actually limiting it to a
subset of a subset, as many objects worth citing don't have
conventional titles.

Erik Vorhes
