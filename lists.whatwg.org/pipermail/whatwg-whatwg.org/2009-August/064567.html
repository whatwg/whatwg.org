</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens when your computer blows up?
</I>
You lose the data the same way you lose your local file data.

&gt;<i> When you switch browsers?
</I>
Unfortunately the same thing that happens with your bookmarks,  
preferences, history, etc - unless the new browser knows how to import  
the old data.

No one would ever claim a browser should be able to arbitrarily prune  
a user's bookmarks &quot;just because you might lose them when switching  
browsers.&quot;  If someone would claim that, I would raise this same  
objection.

&gt;<i> What about when you re-install your OS?
</I>
Same thing as with local files - if you didn't backup your hard disk,  
you lose them.  If you do backup your hard disk and restore files  
after you re-install your OS, you get your localstorage, databases,  
and hell - even your Flash cookies back, just like your files.

&gt;<i> What about mobile devices where 5mb is actually a lot of space?
</I>
These mobile devices are perfectly allowed to restrict the amount of  
data they agree to store with respect to their limited capacity.

&gt;<i> What happens when a malicious site fills up all of your localStorage  
</I>&gt;<i> space?
</I>
This is why per-security-origin quotas exist.  For the counter  
argument of &quot;what about a site that switches subdomains to subvert the  
per-origin quota?&quot;, fortunately HTML5 doesn't disallow browsers from  
limiting per top-level domain or via some other extra limitation.

&gt;<i> You're saying the UAs should not be free to have heuristics about  
</I>&gt;<i> what to delete?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> What do they do then?
</I>
They should be free to have whatever heuristics they'd like when  
choosing what to store.  But once it's stored, it should be persistent.

When a user's hard drive on a desktop machine fills up, should the  
operating system be able to decide &quot;Oh crap, I'm running out of space,  
and I have no other caches or temporary data to delete.  So I'll just  
go ahead and start deleting the user's files without asking?&quot;

LocalStorage is quite clearly modeled after Flash's LocalStorage -  
what does Flash do?  It has all sorts of controls in place to limit  
what data is stored.  But once the data *is* stored, does it ever  
arbitrarily decide to delete it?

&gt;<i> Note this exact point has been discussed on this list before, and  
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC the outcome was that localStorage should be treated like  
</I>&gt;<i> cookies: we'll try to keep them around, but the app should be  
</I>&gt;<i> resilient to them going away.
</I>
This exact point has been discussed on this list more than once, and  
I've only ever seen it die out with no consensus.  If the discussion  
took place and it *was* decided that &quot;User Agents should arbitrarily  
be able to decide to delete LocalStorage or database data without the  
user pre-clearing that action,&quot; then I'm afraid I missed it and I am  
raising my objection now.
