</I>&gt;<i> Section 4.10.4.1.5 defines a valid e-mail address as follows:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is much more restrictive than the full range of e-mail addresses

</I>&gt;<i> type=email&gt; in MediaWiki, and whether to change our server-side e-mail 
</I>&gt;<i> address validation to match.  Historically, MediaWiki has mostly just 
</I>&gt;<i> required that an @ symbol be present in the address. Originally we used 
</I>&gt;<i> a simplistic regex, but when users complained, we looked into the RFCs 
</I>&gt;<i> and decided it was too complicated to bother with validation beyond 
</I>&gt;<i> checking for an @ sign.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So before switching us over, I decided to do some research on how many 
</I>&gt;<i> users' addresses would be invalidated.  I used the database for the 
</I>&gt;<i> English Wikipedia.  Over all registered users, I found 3,088,880 
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed addresses, not necessarily all distinct.  (&quot;Confirmed&quot; here

</I>&gt;<i> AND user_email != '';

</I>&gt;<i> |     3255 |
</I>&gt;<i> +----------+
</I>&gt;<i> 1 row in set (16 min 10.80 sec)
</I>
Thanks for this research, this is exactly the kind of hard data that is 
most useful when writing the spec.


&gt;<i> (Someone please tell me if my regex doesn't match HTML 5 here.)
</I>
If we let 

   X = [-a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&amp;\'*+/=?^_`{|}~]+

...then the regexp is:

   ^X(\.X)*@X(\.X)*$

I believe this is correct, yes.


&gt;<i> Inspection showed that the overwhelming majority of the failures were 
</I>&gt;<i> due to the presence of excess whitespace, often a single trailing space, 
</I>&gt;<i> or a space inserted before or after the @ sign.  When I adjusted the 
</I>&gt;<i> regex to ignore those failures, I got a smaller list, 202 (about 0.007% 
</I>&gt;<i> of the total): [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of these were clearly wrong, and shouldn't have been confirmed to 
</I>&gt;<i> begin with.  Some even didn't have an @ sign, so probably were submitted 
</I>&gt;<i> in some window when we did no validation at all (and I have no idea how 
</I>&gt;<i> they got confirmed).  Of the ones that possibly work, I identified two 
</I>&gt;<i> major categories:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Addresses in the form &quot;foo &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">bar at baz.example</A>&gt;&quot;, or similar.  These 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly match RFC 5322's name-addr production instead of addr-spec (some 
</I>&gt;<i> have trailing semicolons, or are missing the initial &lt;, etc.). I assume 
</I>&gt;<i> these were copy-pasted from a mail application.
</I>
These are intentionally not allowed, since it is expected that the name 
will be taken from elsewhere, and the e-mail address will then be pasted 
into a template with along the lines of &quot;$name &lt;$email&gt;&quot;.


&gt;<i> 2) Addresses with dots in incorrect places, in either the local part
</I>&gt;<i> or the domain name part.  For instance, multiple consecutive dots, or
</I>&gt;<i> leading/trailing dots.  These don't match RFC 5322 at all AFAICT, but
</I>&gt;<i> I asked one of the users with an invalid address of the form
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">foo. at example.com</A>&gt;, and he said it worked fine for him.  GNU mail gave
</I>&gt;<i> a syntax error when I tried to send mail to that address, but Gmail
</I>&gt;<i> sent it without complaint, and the user received it successfully.
</I>
I've change the grammar to allow a trailing dot in the username part.


&gt;<i> I should also note that this was only the English Wikipedia, and it 
</I>&gt;<i> might be that speakers of other languages are more prone to use other 
</I>&gt;<i> types of addresses that don't meet HTML 5's specification.  When looking 
</I>&gt;<i> at the Swedish and German databases, for instance, I found one or two 
</I>&gt;<i> addresses that had apparently been confirmed but contained non-ASCII 
</I>&gt;<i> characters.  I didn't know the users with those addresses, and I didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> want to send them unsolicited mail, so I wasn't able to establish 
</I>&gt;<i> whether those addresses actually worked or the confirmation was bogus.
</I>
I'll leave it as requiring ASCII for now; I expect UAs to do IDNA 
processing on the UI end for the domain side. I'm not sure what is 
supposed to happen on the username side.


&gt;<i> Conclusions: At a minimum, I suggest that HTML 5 require that user 
</I>&gt;<i> agents strip all whitespace from e-mails, not just newlines.  Roughly 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.1% of the addresses from my sample were valid except for extraneous 
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace.  It's a small additional change that would cut the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> illegitimately invalid addresses in my sample by a factor of more than 
</I>&gt;<i> ten.
</I>
This is a UI issue -- if the user enters whitespace, the user agent is 
allowed to trim it. It won't submit with whitespace, so user agents are 
likely to want to do this.


&gt;<i> Beyond that, although it's safe to say that quoted-string or 
</I>&gt;<i> domain-literal or even entirely invalid addresses are extraordinarily 
</I>&gt;<i> rare, there are *some* real people who do use them.  Unless something is 
</I>&gt;<i> so completely invalid that it's obviously impossible that any mail 
</I>&gt;<i> server would even try to send it anywhere, you're probably going to be 
</I>&gt;<i> cutting out some small number of users.
</I>
Do you have any more details on what types of addresses we need to allow?


&gt;<i> So why not have the spec say that in the case of e-mail addresses, the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser may warn the user, but should permit them to submit the address 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway?  If the user is willing to override the warning, then it's 
</I>&gt;<i> likely that they personally know that the e-mail address works, e.g., 
</I>&gt;<i> because they use it.
</I>
I dunno; your data had a number of &quot;obviously wrong&quot; e-mail addresses. I 
would expect users to just click through warnings without checking.


&gt;<i> Alternatively, you could just loosen the restrictions even further, and 
</I>&gt;<i> only ban input that doesn't contain an @ sign.  (Or that doesn't match 
</I>&gt;<i> ^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$, or whatever.)  Or just don't ban anything at all, 
</I>&gt;<i> like with type=tel.  type=email differs from most of the other types 
</I>&gt;<i> with validity constraints (like month, number, etc.) in that the 
</I>&gt;<i> difference between valid and invalid values is a purely pragmatic 
</I>&gt;<i> question (what will actually work?) that the user can often answer 
</I>&gt;<i> better than the application.  It doesn't seem like a good idea for the 
</I>&gt;<i> standard to tell users that the e-mail addresses they've actually been 
</I>&gt;<i> using are invalid.
</I>
I'm not quite ready to give up yet!

This is basically why I want the spec to define how you check for a valid 
e-mail address -- so that the authors won't do anything more than basic 
sanity checking.

I think it's more the theoretically invalid ones (that work anyway) that 
we're worried about.

</I>&gt;<i> The breakdown of the 202 is as follows.

</I>
Raising an error on these seems ok, the user almost certainly didn't mean 
the dot and can just remove it.


&gt;<i> * Single trailing dot in local part: 40 (prohibited by RFC but
</I>&gt;<i> plausibly deliverable)
</I>
Now allowed.


&gt;<i> * Valid address in angle brackets (with other junk around it): 21
</I>&gt;<i> (permitted by RFC, kind of, and plausibly deliverable)
</I>
Intentionally not allowed.


&gt;<i> * Multiple consecutive dots: 20 (prohibited by RFC but plausibly deliverable)
</I>
I've change the grammar to allow multiple dots in the username part.


&gt;<i> * No @: 9 (unlikely to be deliverable)
</I>&gt;<i> * Comment: 3 (permitted by RFC and plausibly deliverable)
</I>
Intentionally not allowed.


&gt;<i> * Miscellaneous: 9 (one containing [NO]@[SPAM], two with trailing &gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> one in &quot;quotes&quot;, one with single leading dot in local part, two with
</I>&gt;<i> single leading comma in local part, one with leading &quot;: &quot;, one with
</I>&gt;<i> leading &quot;\&quot;)
</I>
All but the one with a &quot;.&quot; are intentionally disallowed. The one with a 
leading &quot;.&quot; is now allowed.

So I think that the spec is good now.
