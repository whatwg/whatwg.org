<PRE>
A number of e-mails were sent recently regarding the subject of historical 
dates. This topic was last covered in March in this e-mail:

   <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018888.html</A>

In the interests of not rehashing old ground, I have omitted from my reply 
below replies to e-mails that are redundant with the reply that I sent in 
March, cited above.

It's not clear to me what the use case here is. Without a reason why 
making this data machine-readable is important, it's hard to find good 
ways to solve the problem.

However, it was recently pointed out to me that Microdata is actually a 
quite good way to address this. For example (and I'm making up a 
vocabulary on the fly here, I'm sure a much better job could be done), one 
could cast part of the first of the pages above as follows:

   &lt;span item=&quot;com.example.daterange&quot;
    &gt;[&lt;span itemprop=&quot;com.example.start&quot; item=&quot;com.example.date&quot;
    &gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;com.example.month&quot;&gt;Jan&lt;/span
    &gt;&lt;meta itemprop=&quot;com.example.year&quot; content=&quot;1877&quot;&gt;&lt;/span
    &gt;-&lt;span itemprop=&quot;com.example.end&quot; item=&quot;com.example.date&quot;
    &gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;com.example.month&quot;&gt;June&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span itemprop=&quot;com.example.year&quot;&gt;1877&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

This is apparently already possible:

&gt;<i> It would allow you to determine that *this* event reported in an arabic

</I>&gt;<i> that is on the indiction cycle.  The experts in arabic and byzantine

</I>&gt;<i> the skills in one or the other, but maybe not both (or perhaps even, 
</I>&gt;<i> neither).
</I>
It's unclear to me that there is actually demand to do this on the Web 
from the communities that would be required to actually do it. If there 
was, we would see efforts to work around the limitations in HTML, e.g. 
using Microformats-like solutions. Have we?

These seem like problems that, if the people involved agree that they 
should in fact try to solve them, could be solved first using microdata or 
Microformats vocabularies.

Indeed.

As is described in the FAQ:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F</A>

...it is generally preferred if problems can have demonstrated need before 
we add features, especially features as potentially horrifyingly 
complicated as is being discussed here. There are a number of possible 
technologies that could be used to address this; I would recommend taking 
them, e.g. making a microdata vocabulary, and seeing if the relevant 
communities are actually interested in solving these problems that have 
been listed in this thread.
