 Agreed.
Maybe the symbol being used for the Resource Fetch Algorithm steps, (further
down) where it reads &quot;resource fetch algorithm for a media element and a
given absolute URL&quot;:

&#8618; 'RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK' (U+21AA)

would work better (for marking the &quot;Steps in synchronous sections&quot;) as an
intermediary pointer symbol that follows the step number and precedes the
step description because there is precious little whitespace between,
whereas the &quot;resource fetch algorithm&quot; subsections have no numbering scheme
to deal with _and_ all whitespace to the left of the steps'
descriptions. (ie. Any bulleting symbol would suffice and serve the
purpose.)

Or it could be browser- and font-agnostic enough to even facilitate display
in IE :)
Something like, maybe common math symbols such as:

&#8776; 'ALMOST EQUAL TO' (U+2248)
or
&#177; 'PLUS-MINUS SIGN' (U+00B1)

or whatever. (Just thinking aloud.)

</I>

Yeah, I missed that colon, but the features _are_ listed after these
sentences. It just doesn't stand out as _a list_ .


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sentence #3 Recommends unobtrusive implementation of UI features (for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client's sake).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which duplicates sentence #1, even though that was only two sentences
</I>&gt;<i> before.  So again it looks to me like there was originally something
</I>&gt;<i> in between that made this look less redundant.  As it stands it
</I>&gt;<i> definitely reads strangely to me, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I looked in the version history, but it didn't explain much.  The
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph was added as-is in r678 commented out, then uncommented in
</I>&gt;<i> r697.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that the intent was probably superseded by the result. I almost get
the sense that the pairs of sentences were originally reversed (or the
alternating sentences were). Anyways, words and sentences can _always_ be
condensed and combined. Clarity remains the objective and redundancy the
enemy.
