<PRE>&gt;<i> Maybe the local storage API needs a way to distinguish between cached data

*
*What if instead of the storage APIs providing a way to distinguish things,
UA's provide a way for users to indicate which applications are &quot;important&quot;,
and UA's provide a way for applications guide a user towards making that
indication.*

*Seems like permissioning, blessing, could happen out-of-band of the
existing storage APIs.*

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A web app would also be pretty likely to put stuff in local storage as a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, you're not counting files that you *create* locally. After all,
</I>&gt;<i> files have to come from somewhere :) Those are the most precious since
</I>&gt;<i> they're yours and they may not live anywhere else if you haven't backed them
</I>&gt;<i> up or copied them elsewhere. There's no reason web-apps can't create the
</I>&gt;<i> same kind of content, and it would look very similar to a user: I go to the
</I>&gt;<i> word processor [website], click New Document, type some stuff, and click
</I>&gt;<i> Save.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if the save process involves migrating the local data up to the cloud,
</I>&gt;<i> that transition is not instantaneous: it can take arbitrarily large amounts
</I>&gt;<i> of time if there are network/server problems or the user is offline. During
</I>&gt;<i> that time, *the local storage represents the only copy of the data*. There
</I>&gt;<i> is therefore a serious race condition where, if the browser decides to purge
</I>&gt;<i> local data before the app has uploaded it, the data is gone forever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A better analogy would be, &quot;What if watching TV caused 0-5MB size files to
</I>&gt;<i> silently be created from time to time in a hidden folder on your computer,
</I>&gt;<i> and when your disk filled up both your TV and computer stopped working?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a cache &#8212; that isn't the kind of usage I'm concerned about. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> the local storage API needs a way to distinguish between cached data that
</I>&gt;<i> can be silently thrown away, and important data that can't. (For example,
</I>&gt;<i> the Mac OS has separate 'Caches' and 'Application Support' subfolders of
</I>&gt;<i> ~/Library/.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, this is what quotas are for. The TV web-app would have a limited
</I>&gt;<i> quota of space to cache stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> Second, the browser should definitely help you delete stuff like this if
</I>&gt;<i> disk space does get low; I'm just saying it shouldn't delete it silently or
</I>&gt;<i> as part of some misleading command like &quot;Empty Cache&quot; or &quot;Delete Cookies&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At a minimum the HTML 5 spec should be silent on how user agents implement
</I>&gt;<i> local storage policies. I would prefer the spec to make it clear that local
</I>&gt;<i> storage is a cache, domains can use up to 5MB of space without interrupting
</I>&gt;<i> the user, and that UAs were free to implement varying cache eviction
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That will have the effect of making an interesting category of new
</I>&gt;<i> applications fail, with user data loss, on some browsers. That sounds like a
</I>&gt;<i> really bad idea to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To repeat what I said up above: *Maybe the local storage API needs a way
</I>&gt;<i> to distinguish between cached data that can be silently thrown away, and
</I>&gt;<i> important data that can't.*
