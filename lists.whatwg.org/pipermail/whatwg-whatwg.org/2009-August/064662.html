<PRE>There should also be a way to ask for more quota (from the user) without
losing user data.

The API via a form element is a little odd--generally forms are for
submitting information to the site.  Historically, all of these kinds of
things are done via javascript:
* cookies
* opensearch additions
* extension additions

This would also have the benefit of allowing a Worker() to request quota
without something on the page.

cheers,
Schuyler

</I>&gt;<i> When the user clicks the button they see a dialog that mail.google.com
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://mail.google.com">http://mail.google.com</A>&gt; would like to use 20GB of storage. You have
</I>&gt;<i> 50GB of free space. [Yes] [No]. Script can't cause the dialog to appear,
</I>&gt;<i> only a user action. There would also be some affordance in that dialog
</I>&gt;<i> to allow the user to manage persistent storage from other domains. A
</I>&gt;<i> small &quot;Other sites are using 2GB of storage&quot; link perhaps. AppCache,
</I>&gt;<i> LocalStrorage, and all other persistent bits for that domain would live
</I>&gt;<i> within this quota. UAs would take this user action as a strong signal
</I>&gt;<i> that the data is valuable and would act accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If web sites use LocalStorage, AppCache, et. al. without the user
</I>&gt;<i> clicking on and accepting a storage input button, then the UA would be
</I>&gt;<i> free to garbage collect as it sees fit. Good UAs would do a good job of
</I>&gt;<i> not throwing away things that are important to the user, just as they do
</I>&gt;<i> today with cookies.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     To repeat what I said up above: *Maybe the local storage API

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     silently thrown away, and important data that can't.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     That makes sense to me. There might even be more than two categories:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - Cached for convenience - discarding this will affect performance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     but not functionality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - Useful for offline use - discarding this will prevent some data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     from being accessed when offline.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - Critical for offline use - discarding this will prevent the app
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     storing this data from working offline at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     - Critical user data - discarding this will lead to permanent user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     data loss.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I agree with Maciej's 4-level distinction on philosophical grounds,
</I>&gt;<i>     and think it's a fine list of use cases.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     But I think there's been a reasonable amount of agreement on this
</I>&gt;<i>     list that it is unnecessarily fine grained.  A developer who is
</I>&gt;<i>     consciously choosing a cache will always choose the &quot;most
</I>&gt;<i>     aggressive&quot; cache, and a developer who is consciously choose file
</I>&gt;<i>     storage will always choose the &quot;most sacred&quot; file storage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So we're left with the &quot;cache&quot; vs &quot;file&quot; distinction once more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     All browser vendors who have implemented LocalStorage are willing to
</I>&gt;<i>     implement the &quot;cache&quot;, because what they've done either meets or
</I>&gt;<i>     exceeds the cache use-case.  The remaining question is the file
</I>&gt;<i>     storage.  How do we implement this distinction?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't like the idea of having &quot;different modes&quot; on LocalStorage.
</I>&gt;<i>      How would the &quot;different mode&quot; be triggered?  How would it be
</I>&gt;<i>     managed?  What happens when two applications from the same security
</I>&gt;<i>     origin try to mix modes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Different modes&quot; just makes what is already a dirt simple API more
</I>&gt;<i>     complex, makes implementation more difficult for browser vendors,
</I>&gt;<i>     and confuses web developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So I resubmit my three-Storage-object solution:
</I>&gt;<i>      SessionStorage, CacheStorage, and FileStorage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     From this discussion, it appears that FileStorage is something
</I>&gt;<i>     Google might not be willing to implement.  That's fine!  They can
</I>&gt;<i>     have the object available to scripts but just give it a zero quota.
</I>&gt;<i>      To be more friendly to developers and not force them into checking
</I>&gt;<i>     abilities by catching exceptions we could add one more property to
</I>&gt;<i>     the storage interface so they can check ahead of time whether their
</I>&gt;<i>     attempt to store data will fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Web developers would then have the ability to make the conscious
</I>&gt;<i>     decision of &quot;Is a cache good enough?&quot; and fallback to CacheStorage,
</I>&gt;<i>     or decide &quot;No, I really need persistent data&quot; and fallback to Flash
</I>&gt;<i>     or some other plug-in.  The interfaces are all so similar as to be
</I>&gt;<i>     pretty painless for the developer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Thoughts?
