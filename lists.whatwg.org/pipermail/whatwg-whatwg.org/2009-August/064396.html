<PRE>On Mon, Aug 17, 2009 at 8:27 PM, Aryeh Gregor&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">Simetrical+w3c at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> In 4.8.10.5:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some Unicode characters (U+231B? an hourglass?) here that
</I>&gt;<i> are showing up as white boxes for me at the beginning of some of the
</I>&gt;<i> list elements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Their purpose is described later in 4.8.10.5 Loading the media
resource at step 20:

&quot;(Steps in synchronous sections are marked with &#8987;.)&quot;

and noted again in 6.5.4.2 Processing model at step 4:

&quot;Note: Steps in synchronous sections are marked with &#8987;.&quot;

but the potential for confusion could be further mitigated with an
earlier reference to their purpose... perhaps in &quot;4.8.10.5 Loading the
media resource&quot; at step 9 with an addition to this phrase:

&quot;This algorithm is always invoked synchronously,&quot;

that instead reads something like:

&quot;This algorithm is always invoked synchronously (see steps marked with &#8987;.),&quot;


&gt;<i> &quot;HTTP partial range requests&quot; sounds odd to me, and &quot;partial range&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> redundant.  Maybe just &quot;HTTP range requests&quot;?  The HTTP spec uses
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;range retrieval requests&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I suspect this type of phrasing is born of human desire to shorten
technical jargon into more &quot;familiar&quot; terms for frequent usage. My
examination of the terminology most commonly used in RFC 2616 (related
to what Ian's s trying to convey) suggests (to me) this simple change:

&quot;HTTP partial content range requests&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In 4.8.10.10:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If the attribute is absent, then the user agent should avoid making a
</I>&gt;<i> user interface available that could conflict with an author-provided
</I>&gt;<i> user interface. User agents may make the following features available,
</I>&gt;<i> however, even when the attribute is absent:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;User agents may provide controls to affect playback of the media
</I>&gt;<i> resource (e.g. play, pause, seeking, and volume controls), but such
</I>&gt;<i> features should not interfere with the page's normal rendering. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, such features could be exposed in the media element's context
</I>&gt;<i> menu.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I would have expected a list
</I>&gt;<i> of features after the first quoted paragraph, but instead there's
</I>&gt;<i> another paragraph that partially repeats the content of the first
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph.  It reads like it originally said something different, and
</I>&gt;<i> then something was chopped out and not patched up properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My reading of those paragraphs (two pairs of sentences) suggests (to
me) that some _do_ share purpose (unobtrusive implemetation) or target
(for _whose_ sake) but each seems to &quot;make sense&quot; (to me):

Sentence #1 Recommends unobtrusive implementation of UI features (for
author's sake).
Sentence #2 Permits override of boolean attribute for implementation
of UI features. (for UA's sake)

Sentence #3 Recommends unobtrusive implementation of UI features (for
client's sake).
Sentence #4 Illustrates how implementation of UI features can be both
unobtrusive and avoid interrupting page rendering. (for UA's sake)

---

Perhaps a simple clarification could be effected by changing:

&quot;may make the following features available&quot;

to something like:

&quot;may make the features in this subsection available&quot;


&gt;<i> In 4.8.10.12:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;play&quot; and &quot;playing&quot; have confusingly similar names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I see (only) the unavoidable shared similarity of description (common
to this _Dispatched when..._ column) which Ian currently addresses
through word variations such as &quot;begun&quot; vs. &quot;started&quot;):

&quot;play	Event	Playback has begun.&quot;
&quot;playing	Event	Playback has started.&quot;

In combination with the additional information shown in their
respective  _Preconditions_ columns, there shouldn't be too much
confusion by the consumer. It doesn't seem any different than:

&quot;load&quot; vs. &quot;loadend&quot;  _or_ &quot;seeking&quot; vs. &quot;seeked&quot;
