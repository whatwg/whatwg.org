I've commented out the cue range feature.

There's not going to be a way to do subrange selection in this version of 
the API. It'll be one of the first things to come back, I expect.


As was pointed out, there are many notes in the spec source of things to 
bring to the &quot;next version&quot; of the spec. If anyone wants to maintain an 
off-spec copy of these annotations, please feel free to do so.

I don't really think we want to tie callbacks of this nature to text -- in 
fact, the two are likely to be almost mutally exclusive features: you 
would need callbacks when you're not using timed text solutions, so that 
you can do your own. Another example would be keeping a slide show in sync 
with an audio track, where each slide has a cue range -- this has nothing 
to do with text tracks, and you wouldn't want to have to generate a fake 
text track file just to get the hooks to do this when all your data about 
slide timings is in script already.
