<PRE>Right, trying to answer on-topic ;-)

I guess if the spec doesn't mention anything about where
localStorage is persisted, it leaves it up to every browser
to decide whether to ask the user or use a default 
location. Earlier I didn't think of the possibility of
localStorage data being stored in different locations 
for different apps, but that might be a good idea.

I can see both good and bad sides of this; it's good with
more control for expert users that want to put data in very
specific locations. On the other hand I would also want to 
build apps that don't force users to make decisions about
files and folders at all, they should &quot;just work&quot;.
Maybe the storage decision could be &quot;high level&quot;, offering
simplified alternatives like 
- browser's default storage location
- user account's &quot;documents&quot; location
- that SD card you just inserted

There still is the problem that Michael Nordman mentioned;
there is no way to identify specific applications's data so 
f ex all apps under www.google.com would be routed into the
same file. Will I be able to make collective decisions 
about data for collections of apps like that? Maybe. Or it
will be worked around by even more vanity host names.
(importantdocs.google.com, privatedocs.google.com, ... ;-)

Best regards
