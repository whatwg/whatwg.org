</I>&gt;<i> I would *NOT* be on board with the spec requiring anything about &quot;where the

</I>&gt;<i> that users always need to be in charge of where in a filesystem directory
</I>&gt;<i> tree every single file on their computer needs to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't want the spec to require that either. At that high level, I
</I>&gt;<i> think it should just state that:
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Local storage may contain important user data and should only be deleted
</I>&gt;<i> by direct action of the user.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; The user must be allowed to decide whether code from a particular
</I>&gt;<i> security domain is allowed to store persistent data locally.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; The user must be able to see how much disk space each domain is using,
</I>&gt;<i> and delete individual apps' storage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first item (which is basically already in the spec) allows web-apps to
</I>&gt;<i> store user-created content safely.
</I>&gt;<i> The second item helps prevent abuse.
</I>&gt;<i> The third item helps the user stay in control of her disk (and provides the
</I>&gt;<i> 'direct action of the user' mentioned in item 1.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion involving the Save As dialog is just to show a feasible way
</I>&gt;<i> to implement those requirements on a desktop OS in a way that makes it
</I>&gt;<i> fairly clear to the user what's going on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a huge fan of the &quot;my mom&quot; litmus test.  To my mom, the filesystem is
</I>&gt;<i> scary and confusing.  But using the browser to manage browser-related things
</I>&gt;<i> is familiar and learnable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I like about using the regular Save As dialog box is that almost every
</I>&gt;<i> user has some experience with it, and knows that it means *this app wants
</I>&gt;<i> to put files on my disk*. Naive users tend to just hit Enter and let
</I>&gt;<i> everything be saved to a default location, which is fine. (In OS X, the
</I>&gt;<i> default collapsed state of the Save panel supports that.) Users who are
</I>&gt;<i> savvy with the filesystem know how to navigate to a different directory if
</I>&gt;<i> they want, or at least look at where the file's going to be saved by
</I>&gt;<i> default.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This works well for storing user generated content (save-as, open what i
saved earlier), doesn't work so well for application data that is less user
perceptible.

It also doesn't look like the type of security-nag dialog that people
&gt;<i> instinctively OK without reading.
