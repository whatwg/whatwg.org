OK, so an alt entry in the spec should not mandate its display at a
specified situation, but could just suggest it as a possible &quot;more
detailed information&quot;. So the spec would become:

In addition to the above, the user agent may provide messages to the
user (such as &quot;buffering&quot;, &quot;no video loaded&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, the contents of
the alt attribute, or other more detailed information) by overlaying
text or icons on the video or other areas of the element's playback
area, or in another appropriate manner.[end quote]

&gt;&gt;<i> If videos are desirable and available, but text is also desirable,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the alt text could be displayed/spoken/etc when you tab onto it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as Silvia Pfeiffer proposed in a previous email.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that was accomplished with some kind of ARIA attributes, correct
</I>&gt;<i> me if I'm wrong.
</I>
I'm no expert on ARIA, but as far as I know it can be done with
aria-labelledby. This is pretty complicated though. You have to
provide an additional element, style or hide it, and reference it
through aria-labelledby. It's pretty DIY. This looks like another
longdesc fiasco to me. It has other more realistic uses such as making
existing elements (forms, etc) accessible, but I don't see it getting
used for arbitrary alternate content.

It would be a lot nicer if a web author could just provide an alt text
which would show up when the video doesn't load for whatever reason. I
don't think it's possible to create an easier tool for web authors to
make a video somewhat accessible.

Same stuff applies to &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;img&gt;.
