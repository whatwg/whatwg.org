</I>&gt;<i> agent has to make before it has the resource available?
</I>
Sure. For example, the UA might want to display the list of resources to 
the user. In such a UI, if the UI includes types, it would have to use the 
type=&quot;&quot; attribute's value as the type.


&gt;<i> &gt; For Web browsers, this problem only occurs if at least one major 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser violates the spec. Until one does, the browsers can just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refuse to render the site -- since all the browsers will be doing the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same thing, the site cannot legitimately blame the browers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless the problem is non-obvious to authors but significant to some 
</I>&gt;<i> consumers (but not enough to make authors widely aware of it).  My 
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical scenario had authors providing an incorrect type=&quot;&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.  Perhaps all browsers supported both types anyway, so they 
</I>&gt;<i> retrieved the resource thinking it was type X, then determined it was 
</I>&gt;<i> type Y and processed it as that with no errors being raised.  But then 
</I>&gt;<i> if one browser (or search engine, etc.) happens to support type Y but 
</I>&gt;<i> not type X, you get bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another example that I think you yourself have mentioned in the past is 
</I>&gt;<i> Opera's mobile version.  It deliberately mangles display in a 
</I>&gt;<i> nonstandard fashion to better fit on a small screen.  Again, here the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem isn't obvious to most authors (since they didn't test on small 
</I>&gt;<i> screens), but the implementor is able to improve experience for a 
</I>&gt;<i> significant market of consumers if they ignore the standards.
</I>
I guess I don't understand what you're asking for the spec to do. Do you 
want to drop the type=&quot;&quot; attribute altogether?


&gt;<i> &gt; Probably a little (forms have been pretty successful despite a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; horrible styling story for over a decade)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because it's impossible to achieve the same functionality as forms -- 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically building a GET request based on user input, or any POST 
</I>&gt;<i> request at all -- any other way without requiring JavaScript.  (Which 
</I>&gt;<i> locks out some users, and is harder to write.)  And until a few years 
</I>&gt;<i> ago, when XHR became widely supported, AFAIK it wasn't possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> permit POSTs (necessary for large amounts of input, for instance) even 
</I>&gt;<i> with JavaScript.
</I>
People use forms now, still, despite this situation having changed.
