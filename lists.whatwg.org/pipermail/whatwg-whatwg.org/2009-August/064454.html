Ah thanks, I had missed the part saying that path and query
were ok to change. I think this part of the spec is very
controversial though, but I'll spawn that discussion to
another thread.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#160;It would further be nice if your comments weren't lost even if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; navigate away from the page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is the way it works in most browsers, as the browser persists

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  But the difficulty with this page in particular is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> structured such that it's difficult/impossible for the browser to
</I>&gt;<i> properly restore its form state after a crash.  Onload, the page
</I>&gt;<i> creates a &lt;textarea&gt; and populates it with the text of the patch.  So
</I>&gt;<i> if we crash then restore, the page won't have created the textarea by
</I>&gt;<i> the time the browser looks to restore the text.

Sorry, it seems we are not talking about the same application.
Jonas referred to attachment pages in your bug database, which
I assumed would f ex be a page like this one:
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=386244&amp;action=edit">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=386244&amp;action=edit</A>
(The textarea in this app is not created onload, it is delivered
in the server-generated HTML and thus is subject to form field
value persistence.)

What app are you talking about?

&gt;<i> what we really want is a
</I>&gt;<i> way to programmatically do the restore.
</I>
Certainly, that's why we are all here I guess :-)
Being able to do similar things as form field value persistence
and scroll position persistence, but for your own data, is the
purpose of history states, IMO.

Best regards
Mike
