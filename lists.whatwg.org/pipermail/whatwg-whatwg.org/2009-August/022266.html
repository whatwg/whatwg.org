</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would like to propose that we get rid of the concepts of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;versions&quot; altogether from HTML. In reality, nobody supports all of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; HTML5. Each vendor supports a slightly different subset of the spec, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; along with some features that are outside the spec.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This seems OK to me. Instead of insisting that a particular version 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of HTML is a monolithic unit that must be implemented in its 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; entirety, we could have each feature (or logical group of features) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; spun off into its own small spec. We're already doing this a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with things like Web Workers, but I don't see why we don't just do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it for everything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Just as they do now, vendors would decide at the end of the day 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which features they would implement and which they would not. But we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; should never have to say that &quot;the spec is too big&quot;. If somebody is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interested in exploring an idea, they should be able to just start 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doing that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree in principle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wholeheartedly agree with all the reasoning, but there are issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From an implementor's point of view it is much harder to implement and 
</I>&gt;<i> keep up with a mutating specification. During implementation a stable 
</I>&gt;<i> spec is preferred.
</I>
The parts of the spec you would be implementing would still be stable, 
it's just that other parts of it would evolve.


&gt;<i> Currently, because specs are being edited and might take a while to get 
</I>&gt;<i> to CR, we have different implementors implement different parts of the 
</I>&gt;<i> specifications, and then meanwhile the specification mutates and 
</I>&gt;<i> implementors have to waste time updating their implementation which 
</I>&gt;<i> could have been right from the start. I understand that implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback is necessary, but this is not very optimal.
</I>
We have to keep the spec from running away from implementations anyway, 
whether we have a stable snapshot model or a continually evolving model.


&gt;<i> After a spec gets to CR it can't just mutate out of thin air, hence 
</I>&gt;<i> forking it into a new version is the way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example: Gecko, Webkit and IE have localStorage, but the spec changed a 
</I>&gt;<i> few days ago to allow structured storage.
</I>
If we do snapshots, it just means the implementors are working on an 
obsolete version of the spec, which is worse.
