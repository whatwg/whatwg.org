<PRE>Ah good, something made me think you were trying to populate
&quot;fresh&quot; history entries as well, which would have been 
awkward. 

We've been discussing general properties of the solution for 
a while now. It would be interesting to see a concrete
example on how you intend the dynamics of your solution to
work. It would be great if you could outline the different
events and method calls used (in order) to save and restore
the history state object in the following situations:
- doing a &quot;fresh&quot; navigation from page#1 to page#2
- going back in history from page#2 to page#1

If we start with this simple example (simple hash nav and
no URL &quot;impersonation&quot;) then maybe we can move on to more
advanced stuff later on. I'm assuming page#1 and page#2 are
perceived by the user as different parts of the application 
and that he wants state saved for each of them when 
navigating back and forth in history.

Best regards
Mike

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A navigation on a new tab would get an entirely new environment.
