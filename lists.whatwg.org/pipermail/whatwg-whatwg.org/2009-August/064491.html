</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Based on some of the feedback on Microdata recently, e.g.:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...and a number of e-mails sent to this list and the W3C lists, I am going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to try some tweaks to the Microdata syntax. Google has kindly offered to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide usability testing resources so that we can try a variety of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different syntaxes and see which one is easiest for authors to understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If anyone has any concrete syntax ideas that they would like me to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider, please let me know. There's a (pretty low) limit to how many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> syntaxes we can perform usability tests on, though, so I won't be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test every idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be more than just tweaking the syntax, but I think
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate to bring forth my CRDF proposal as a suggestion for an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to Microdata. For reference, the latest version of the
</I>&gt;<i> document can be found at [1], and the discussion that has happenned
</I>&gt;<i> about it can be found at [2].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than just saying &quot;use that syntax&quot;, I'm including here what IMO
</I>&gt;<i> are the most prominent advantages (and potential issues) of that
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, in no particular order:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> + Optional use of selectors: while the ability to use selectors seems
</I>&gt;<i> quite useful, specially to handle &quot;list&quot; or &quot;collection&quot; cases, it has
</I>&gt;<i> been argued that users may have problems with elaborated selectors.
</I>&gt;<i> Since the last update of the CRDF document, this is addressed with the
</I>&gt;<i> expanded inline content model: it should possible to express with only
</I>&gt;<i> inline CRDF, and without using selectors at all, any semantics that
</I>&gt;<i> can be represented with RDFa, Microdata, EASE, or eRDF. In other
</I>&gt;<i> words: while CRDF can take full benefit of selectors to make better
</I>&gt;<i> and/or clearer documents, it can still handle most cases (those
</I>&gt;<i> actually handled by existing solutions) without them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> + Microformats mapping: for good data (specifically, all content that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't duplicate any &quot;singular&quot; property), CRDF allows trivially
</I>&gt;<i> mapping Microformat-marked data to an arbitrary RDF vocabulary (or
</I>&gt;<i> even to multiple, overlapping vocabularies), thus allowing its re-use
</I>&gt;<i> with RDF-related tools and/or combining it with RDF data from other
</I>&gt;<i> sources and/or marked with other syntaxes. In order to achieve 100%
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility with Microformats.org' processing model (including any
</I>&gt;<i> form of bad data), a minor addition to Selectors is suggested in the
</I>&gt;<i> document, although no substantial feedback has been given on it
</I>&gt;<i> (neither against nor in favor).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> + Microformats-like but decentralized: the main issue with
</I>&gt;<i> Microformats, at least with non-widespread vocabularies, is
</I>&gt;<i> centralization: it requires a criticall mass of use-cases to get the
</I>&gt;<i> Microformats community to engage in the process of creating a new
</I>&gt;<i> vocabulary. With CRDF, any author may build their own vocabulary
</I>&gt;<i> (implementing it as a CRDF mapping to RDF) and use it on their pages.
</I>&gt;<i> If a vocabulary later gains momentum and is adopted by a wide enough
</I>&gt;<i> set of authors, it'd be up to the Microformats community to decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether &quot;standarize&quot; it or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> + Prefix declarations go out of HTML: After so many discussions,
</I>&gt;<i> namespace prefixes has been the main source of criticism against RDFa.
</I>&gt;<i> One of these criticism is the range of technicall issues that arise
</I>&gt;<i> from the &quot;xmlns:&quot; syntax for defining namespace prefixes (in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tag-soup&quot; syntax). CRDF handles this case by taking away the
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility of prefix declarations from HTML: having a CSS-based
</I>&gt;<i> syntax, CRDF takes the obvious step and uses CSS's own syntax for
</I>&gt;<i> namespace declarations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> + Entirely RDF based: while this might seem a purely theoretical
</I>&gt;<i> advantage, there is also a practical benefit: once extracted from the
</I>&gt;<i> webpage, CRDF data can be easily combined with any already existing
</I>&gt;<i> RDF data; and can be used with RDF-related tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Copy-paste brittleness: IMO, the only serious drawback from CRDF;
</I>&gt;<i> but there are some points worth making:
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;1) When used inline, CRDF can achieve the same resilience than RDFa,
</I>&gt;<i> which is quite close to Microdata's.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;2) I have noticed that some browsers can manage to copy-paste
</I>&gt;<i> CSS-styled content preserving (most of) format. It shouldn't be hard
</I>&gt;<i> for implementors to extend such functionality to CRDF. Of course, the
</I>&gt;<i> support for this is not consistent among browsers, and also seems to
</I>&gt;<i> vary for different paste targets. If there is some real interest, I
</I>&gt;<i> might do some testing with multiple browsers and paste targets (for
</I>&gt;<i> now, I have noticed that both IE and FF preserve most CSS formatting
</I>&gt;<i> (but not layout) when pasting to Word, but pasting to OOo Writter gets
</I>&gt;<i> rendered with the &quot;default&quot; formatting for the tags). It would be
</I>&gt;<i> interesting, on this aspect, to hear about browser vendors: would they
</I>&gt;<i> be willing to extend the CSS copy-paste capabilities to CRDF if it got
</I>&gt;<i> adopted?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Prefix-based indirection: I'd bet that there are people on this list
</I>&gt;<i> ready to argue that namespace prefixes are a good thing; but it seems
</I>&gt;<i> that it raises some issues, so I'll include them and share my PoV on
</I>&gt;<i> the topic:
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;1) For those who care about the use of widespread prefixes (like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;foaf&quot; or &quot;dc&quot;) being used for something weird, or the use of
</I>&gt;<i> different prefixes for these vocabularies, I wouldn't mind adding some
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;default&quot; prefix mappings for CRDF to address this.
</I>&gt;<i>  &#160;2) The &quot;Follow your nose&quot; topic is a bit more complex: IMO, a RDF
</I>&gt;<i> application that needs to successfully FYN to work is insane; OTOH, an
</I>&gt;<i> application that works just fine, but can FYN and provide *additional*
</I>&gt;<i> information *when available* is quite a good thing. This is an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation design issue, and CRDF can't do too much here: the best
</I>&gt;<i> thing I can think of is to state that applications should *attempt* to
</I>&gt;<i> FYN, and use or show to the user the extra info *when successful*, but
</I>&gt;<i> must still be able to use a document's information when FYN fails.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, CRDF is already moving in such direction: the type inference
</I>&gt;<i> rules (still under construction) try to infer the properties' types
</I>&gt;<i> from the vocabularies first, but take the basic type of the value if
</I>&gt;<i> that fails (unless, of course, the CRDF code uses explicit typing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Entirely new: this is a minor disadvantage agains RDFa and
</I>&gt;<i> Microformats, but not when compared to Microdata. It is a disadvantage
</I>&gt;<i> because for already existing formats there are already existing
</I>&gt;<i> implementations, and it is minor because it shouldn't be hard for
</I>&gt;<i> browsers (and some other forms of UA's that also handle CSS) to
</I>&gt;<i> implement it reusing most of their CSS-related code. Again, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate some vendors' feedback on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what I can think of now. Of course, CRDF has some issues: it's
</I>&gt;<i> still work in progress, and it lacks implementations and
</I>&gt;<i> implementation feedback, but it also provides significant advantages
</I>&gt;<i> that, IMO, far outweigth the drawbacks.
