To clarify somewhat: the 6 month threshold is one example of a rule I  
could support. But I would find a wide range of rules acceptable. My  
only hard requirements are:

(a) The rule has to have a reasonable relationship to what can be  
considered a &quot;controversial open issue&quot;
(b) The rule has to be reasonably objective.
(c) The rule should not be so broad that it would apply to almost  
every open issue.
(d) It needs to be stated clearly what the rule is.

If any issue gets this kind of distinctive marker, then I will expect  
the Chairs to make it a high priority to promptly bring it to a  
definitive resolution.

Regards,
Maciej
