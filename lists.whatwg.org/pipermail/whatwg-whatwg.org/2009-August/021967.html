</I>
Ok. I think this is the direction we should look in to address this use 
case then. I haven't specced anything yet, but I've noted it as a feature 
we should look at. If anyone wants to experiment in this space, that would 
be great.


&gt;<i> Sure, although I'd say that &quot;persistent storage is addressed by the Web 
</I>&gt;<i> Storage and Web Database features&quot;. Shared state is also addressed, but 
</I>&gt;<i> that's not the primary goal. If I have a tree of objects that I'd like 
</I>&gt;<i> to share between two pages, telling me to serialize it into name/value 
</I>&gt;<i> string pairs, write it into Web Storage, and then have the remote side 
</I>&gt;<i> read it out is not a satisfying (or performant) solution.
</I>
Web Storage supports structured data now.


&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm somewhat leery of the &quot;canned RSS-feed&quot;-style solution to 
</I>&gt;<i> notifications (our vision for notifications is that they are scriptable 
</I>&gt;<i> and more interactive than just a dumb text + icon).
</I>
A system that displays rich/scripted content on server demand rather than 
on user demand is a massive security nightmare. It turns a scripting 
security bug and an XSS bug into an instant malware deployment vector.


&gt;<i> Additionally, any server-side-feed-based solution has the implication 
</I>&gt;<i> that it won't work for offline apps. If I am using a web calendar, I 
</I>&gt;<i> want my event notifications regardless of whether I'm online or offline 
</I>&gt;<i> (the event may have been added while I'm offline and never synced to the 
</I>&gt;<i> server at all).
</I>
I think on the long term we may wish to consider adding a feature to queue 
up POSTs for when the UA finds it is back online. That would address a 
number of problems, including this one.

We can make this work with all of the mechanisms pretty easily.

</I>&gt;<i> What don't you like about XMPP?
</I>
It's far too complex for people to write and deploy an XMPP server on a 
whim. Like HTTP, it requires people to use off-the-shelf software instead 
of allowing them to experiment with their own code. This leads to software 
monocultures, and prevents easy experimentation.

</I>
I don't think that such a mechanism will work well given multicore 
processors, multiprocess UAs, and the way that gadgets end up connecting 
domains all over the place.


&gt;<i> 2. It does rely on 'cooperative' pages to be opened in the same process 
</I>&gt;<i> but this is easy to implement. I mean, you can't 'guarantee' it (a page 
</I>&gt;<i> from another domain may have iframe pointing to the app and it will be 
</I>&gt;<i> in a diff. process) but any reasonable app can be easily structured in a 
</I>&gt;<i> way to get its views (pages) into a single process.
</I>
I think this is understating the disadvantages of this model, and 
overestimating the ease with which one can make it work.


&gt;<i> 3. It would help to provide fast (meaning sub-100ms, interactively fast) 
</I>&gt;<i> UI responses necessary for the seamless operations. Persistent data 
</I>&gt;<i> storage and parsing/generating HTML (including loading all the code 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to do that from the 'pure data') will always present challenge 
</I>&gt;<i> for sub-100ms UI actions - even in native apps it is a challenge today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a typical use case: You compose a message in GMial window. 
</I>&gt;<i> Halfway through you decide to peek into another mail thread for more 
</I>&gt;<i> information. You click 'tear-off' button to &quot;disconnect&quot; the compose 
</I>&gt;<i> window so you can see other mail threads. Today, this opens a new window 
</I>&gt;<i> and starts loading XXX Kb of script into it. You see the progress 
</I>&gt;<i> indicator for a few seconds. This script is needed to be able to go to 
</I>&gt;<i> server and generate a proper UI from the response, as well as have all 
</I>&gt;<i> the 'controller' logic when user starts to interact with such UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With shared context, you could just take the whole DOM subtree that 
</I>&gt;<i> forms a compose window UI and pass it, as is, into the new and empty 
</I>&gt;<i> window - with even handlers hooked into the shared context. It will just 
</I>&gt;<i> relayout and continue function. You have an 'instant' tear-off.
</I>
You don't need a shared context to do this. window.open() gives you the 
DOM, you can already populate it immediately.

</I>
I really don't feel right allowing script to run like that.

Why can't the server send the data to the client in a near-final form and 
let the script figure it out when the user finally opens the app?


&gt;<i> I agree that the UX and Security issues around always-on persistent

</I>&gt;<i> this area to see whether they can be overcome.
</I>
Certainly experimentation is always encouraged.


&gt;<i> Regardless, I think it's premature to latch onto a single potential use 
</I>&gt;<i> case for persistent script (static text + icon calendar notifications) 
</I>&gt;<i> and start building extensive alternative mechanisms to satisfy that

</I>
What other use cases are there? Those were the ones given. We're very much 
use-case-driven here.
