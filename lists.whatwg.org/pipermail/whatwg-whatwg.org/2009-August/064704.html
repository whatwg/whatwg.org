This is a key point, we're getting way off topic.  Web apps accessing  
the &quot;raw file system&quot; is wrought with completely different (and much  
more difficult) concerns than we've been discussing, and is completely  
out of the scope of getting persistent LocalStorage working in an  
agreeable manner.

&gt;<i> The purpose is just for the user to have some control of whether to  
</I>&gt;<i> give the app storage at all, and if so where to put it, and the  
</I>&gt;<i> ability to manage that storage via the regular file manager UI. (Or  
</I>&gt;<i> for platforms that don't have such a UI, like the iPhone, some kind  
</I>&gt;<i> of flat list of web-apps.)
</I>
For this first foray into persistent storage for the web, I am -  
reluctantly - on board with the proposal of make a user explicit  
&quot;save&quot; like action part of the permanent LocalStorage experience.

I would *NOT* be on board with the spec requiring anything about  
&quot;where the file goes on the filesystem.&quot;  I have never been convinced  
by the argument that users always need to be in charge of where in a  
filesystem directory tree every single file on their computer needs to  
go.

I'm a huge fan of the &quot;my mom&quot; litmus test.  To my mom, the filesystem  
is scary and confusing.  But using the browser to manage browser- 
related things is familiar and learnable.

To take Jens's suggestion further, user agents on ANY platform should  
be allowed to turn the browser into a &quot;shoebox app&quot; that manages its  
own data.
