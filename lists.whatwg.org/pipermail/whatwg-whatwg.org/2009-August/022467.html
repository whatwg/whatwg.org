<PRE>These arguments against the proposal are not persuasive. I remain of the
opinion that the GlobalScript proposal has merit.

&gt;<i> we really haven't solved the problem this is setting out to solve
</I>
What problem do you think this is trying to solve? I think you're
misunderstanding the motivation. The motivation is frame/page navigation
performance once an app is up and running.


&gt;<i> However, we can't. Given that all frames in a browsing context have to be
</I>&gt;<i> on the same thread, regardless of domain, then unless we put all the
</I>&gt;<i> browsing contexts on the same thread, we can't guarantee that all frames
</I>&gt;<i> from the same domain across all browsing contexts will be on the same
</I>&gt;<i> thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As proposed, there is nothing that forces things into a single thread. Those
contexts that happen to be on the same thread can benefit from the feature.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But further, we actually wouldn't want to anyway. One of the goals of
</I>&gt;<i> having multiple processes is that if one tab crashes, the others don't. We
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't want one GMail crash to take down all GMail, Google Calendar,
</I>&gt;<i> Google Chat, Google Reader, Google Search, and Google Voice tabs at once,
</I>&gt;<i> not to mention all the blogs that happened to use Google AdSense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, consider performance going forward. CPUs have pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> gotten as fast as they're getting -- all further progress is going to be
</I>&gt;<i> in making multithreaded applications that use as many CPUs as possible. We
</I>&gt;<i> should actively moving away from single-threaded designs towards
</I>&gt;<i> multithreaded designs. A shared global script is firmly in the old way of
</I>&gt;<i> doing things, and won't scale going forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> moving away from single-threaded designs
</I>
I don't think there is any move away for the concept of a 'related set of
browsing context' that are required to behave in a single threaded fashion?
 There is a place for that, it is a greatly simplifying model that nobody
wants to see removed.

The proposal is to add GlobalScripts to that set of browsing contexts, and
where convenient , for the UA to have two different related sets share the
same GlobalScript... &quot;where convenient&quot; is key.

&gt;<i> old way
</I>
Ironic... the global script is a decidedly application centric proposal.
Whereas the vast majority of HTML is decidedly page centric. So disagree
that this is &quot;firmly&quot; rooted in the old way of doing things.


&gt;<i> &gt; Chat application opens separate window for each conversation. Any opened
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window may be closed and user expectation is that remaining windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continue to work fine. Loading essentially whole chat application and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintaining data structures (roster) in each window takes a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources and cpu.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use a shared worker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that some consider the asynchronous interaction with workers to be
</I>&gt;<i> a blocker problem, but I don't really understand why. We already have to
</I>&gt;<i> have asynchronous communication with the server, which holds the roster
</I>&gt;<i> data structure, and so on. What difference does it make if instead of
</I>&gt;<i> talking to the server, you talk to a worker?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Provided you can talk to the 'shared worker' in the same fashion you can
talk to the server (XHR)... you have a point here when it comes to keeping
application 'state' in memory and quickly retrieving it from any page in the
application. But, using a worker  does nothing to keep application 'code'
required to run in pages 'hot'... code that does HTML DOM manipulation for
example can't run in the worker.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finance site could open multiple windows to show information about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular stocks. At the same time, each page often includes data-bound
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UI components reflecting real-time market data, breaking news etc. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very natural to have a shared context which can be directly accessed by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UI on those pages, so only one set of info is maintained.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, use a shared worker. The UI side of things can be quite dumb, with
</I>&gt;<i> data pushed to it from a shared worker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The key phrase was &quot;directly accessed by the UI&quot;... not possible with a
shared worker.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A game may open multiple windows sharing the same model to provide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different views at the game objects (as in flight simulator).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You wouldn't even want the logic (simulator) in this case to be on the
</I>&gt;<i> same thread as the renderers. In fact ideally you'd want everything on a
</I>&gt;<i> different thread so that you got the best performance out of the system
</I>&gt;<i> -- each renderer, each simulator, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Kind of an academic discussion but... you may want a representation of the
model to be shared by all of its views (that happend to be on the same UI
thread). Perhaps the 'simiulator' would be running on a background thread
and sending async commands to mutate the model (as seen by views) as the
simulation runs.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In an email application, a user may want to open a separate &quot;compose&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window for a new email, often after she started to &quot;answer in place&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realized she'd like to look up something else in the mailbox for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer. This could be an instantaneous operation if the whole html tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the compose editor script were shared.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is possible without a shared global script -- it's possible now, in
</I>&gt;<i> fact. Just open a window, and graft the DOM tree from the original window
</I>&gt;<i> into the new window.
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Such multiple-window use cases could be simpler and use much less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources if they had access to a shared Global Script Context so there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no need to re-initialize and maintain the same state in all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages. Having direct, same-thread DOM/JS access to this context makes it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to avoid loading and initialization of repetitive code and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data, makes separate 'UI windows' simpler and independent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's no need for this case to use shared _global_ script; a shared
</I>&gt;<i> script just between the original window and the popped-out window is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient (and already supported).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

You can't rely on opener since it can be closed at any time... including
prior to the openee being loaded.



&gt;<i> &gt; Another case is an application that uses navigation from page to page
</I>&gt;<i> using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; menu or some site navigation mechanism. Global Script Context could keep
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application state so it doesn't have to be round-tripped via server in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cookie or URL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can keep the state using sessionStorage or localStorage, or you can
</I>&gt;<i> use pushState() instead of actual navigation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
* GlobalScript is a friendlier, easier, more accessible means of
accompishing things

* LocalStorage is acutally persistent which is not want is wanted. Would
need to recognize and ignore stale data.

* PushState is an odd artifact of page-centricity. Its there (partly at
least) to help avoid having to perform frame navigations at all.

Maybe a better approach would be to make frame navigations not so costly.

</I>&gt;<i> I haven't added the Global Script Object proposal to HTML5. Even if we
</I>&gt;<i> were to add it to the platform, it would probably belong in its own
</I>&gt;<i> specification rather than in the HTML spec. We would also probably need

</I>&gt;<i> it is the direction we should be taking the platform in. Granted,
</I>&gt;<i> programmers today don't want to use threads -- but, well, tough. All
</I>&gt;<i> indications are that that's what the programming model of the next few
</I>&gt;<i> decades is going to be; now is the time to move that way. We shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> adding features that actually move us back to the single-threaded world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it would probably belong in its own spec
</I>Maybe this would fit better under the banner of w3c wep apps?

&gt;<i>  We would also probably need implementation experience before specifying
</I>it
Does that mean you won't help produce a draft spec of this for us to work
with?

&gt;<i> programmers today don't want to use threads -- but, well, tough
</I>A resounding conclusion of our experience with Gears was the using
workers/threads is hard. There is a place for them, but they're not such a
good fit in other places.
