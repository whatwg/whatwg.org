It seems we do indeed agree that the state object is for
storing state that could differ for multiple history entries
for the same URL, and what you are actually saying is that
you think this feature should not be used for &quot;important&quot;
state. I'm fine as long the former is true, and you are
free to have an opinion about the latter.

&gt;<i> &gt; Though, when taking a more thorough look at what is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec:ed, it seems these use cases are indeed not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supported, due to state update limitations and how events 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are ordered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to fix this by making popstate more synchronous.
</I>
I still don't think this fixes my issues. I've described most
of these in the thread &quot;Proposed changes to the History API&quot;
so I'll wait until you reply to that before commenting
further here.

Best regards
Mike
