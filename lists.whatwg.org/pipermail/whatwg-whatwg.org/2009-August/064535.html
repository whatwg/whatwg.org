We have done this with &lt;a&gt;, and the problems it introduces are 
substantial. I'm very reluctant to extend this to more elements.


&gt;<i> &gt; Allowing elements to wrap both inlines and blocks is a huge can of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worms which has caused all kinds of problems for &lt;ins&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;a&gt;. I really don't want to start adding more elements to this list of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I certainly realize that -- you can't even say what their CSS display 
</I>&gt;<i> property should be set to, at least not in a way that CSS currently 
</I>&gt;<i> supports.  But once everyone has to support this behavior for those 
</I>&gt;<i> three elements, is there any reason not to extend the same behavior to 
</I>&gt;<i> other elements?  Is there a significant marginal cost for allowing use 
</I>&gt;<i> as both inline and block for new elements once we've already paid the 
</I>&gt;<i> overhead of allowing it at all?
</I>
Yes, I think so. You can special-case a few elements in an editor's UI, 
for example, without extending the complexity to the entire app.

Just don't use &lt;small&gt; at all, and just make the font size smaller in CSS.


&gt;<i> For example, the BBC's web site is using the 62.5% rule, then by default 
</I>&gt;<i> pages are shown in 1.2em.  The exception being their terms pages, which 
</I>&gt;<i> overrides the font size to 1em in a terms.css style sheet.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> because they want the text to appear as small print.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BBC Terms:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/terms/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/terms/</A>
</I>
That page is a great example of where _not_ to use &lt;small&gt; -- the text on 
there is the main content of the page, it's not a throw-away side comment.

I've added text to this effect.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any record of these issues.  I know of 1 rendering issue that 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox has with nesting the section element inside the a element (but 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure you're referring to previously solved issues).
</I>
The issues are things like:

 * It makes it possible to have phrasing-level elements span paragraphs:

     Fred stood up. &lt;i&gt; How are you?
     &lt;p&gt; Are you ok? &lt;/i&gt; He sat down again.

 * It makes it very difficult to have intuitive UI in WYSIWYG editors.

 * It leads to confusing parsing behaviour, e.g. there are nested 
   paragraphs here, which is not allowed, and is highly unobvious:

     &lt;p&gt; This is uncontroversial text.
     &lt;ins&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is new text. &lt;/ins&gt;
     &lt;del&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is deleted text. &lt;/del&gt;

Right.

I agree that this is more borderline. However, you've given this its own 
section, so I wouldn't bother with &lt;small&gt; at all.

I've tried rewording it.

</I>
If &lt;small&gt; was a block-level element in HTML4, then I think we'd just make 
it a flow-level element here and give up on inline throw-away comments. 
But as it is, it's the other way around. I don't think we want one element 
to do both, though, and I don't think this use case is important enough to 
bother with if we can't just leverage existing elements.
