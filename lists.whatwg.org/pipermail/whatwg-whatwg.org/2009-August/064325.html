I wholeheartedly agree with all the reasoning, but there are issues.

 From an implementor's point of view it is much harder to implement and  
keep up with a mutating specification. During implementation a stable spec  
is preferred.
So versioning will allow an implementor to decide to implement the latest  
stable version of some spec, while work proceeds on a newer one.
And when I refer mutating specification I'm not referring to the whole  
html5 spec, but each separate component, like web storage, web workers,  
video, etc...
Currently, because specs are being edited and might take a while to get to  
CR, we have different implementors implement different parts of the  
specifications, and then meanwhile the specification mutates and  
implementors have to waste time updating their implementation which could  
have been right from the start. I understand that implementation feedback  
is necessary, but this is not very optimal.
After a spec gets to CR it can't just mutate out of thin air, hence  
forking it into a new version is the way to go.

Example: Gecko, Webkit and IE have localStorage, but the spec changed a  
few days ago to allow structured storage.
