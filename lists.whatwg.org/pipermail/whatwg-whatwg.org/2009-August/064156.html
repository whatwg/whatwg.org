</I>Another assenting voice, here.

I really appreciated seeing all the areas where there are ongoing 
discussions and concerns, and controversies, marked out in one spot. 
I've been following about half a dozen issues, but just can't follow 
everything. It's nice to see something pull this together. The issues 
database is too disconnected from the document, and most people aren't 
going to look at it.

The only addition I would have is about the entire obsolete section, 
because of language such as &quot;obsolete but conforming&quot;. Removing the 
previous deprecated/obsolete definitions and sections is controversial, 
and has been a matter of discussion. There's also a great deal of 
confusion about &quot;obsolete but conforming&quot;.

It's too bad that the canvas element was previously voted on, because it 
has no place in the HTML 5 specification. Including it within the spec 
limits its usefulness and arbitrarily ties it the HTML document. There 
has been interest about pulling this one out into a separate working 
group, and I'd volunteer to be a member of that group if this happens. I 
don't know if this fits within the &quot;warning&quot; criteria though.

I have another major concern, but I know it won't enjoy consensus, so 
I'll bring it up at a separate time.

All in all, this was a really good idea. It shows a true state of the 
effort, at a glance.

Appreciate you doing this, Manu.

Shelley
