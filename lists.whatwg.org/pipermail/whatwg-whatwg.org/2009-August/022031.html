I agree in principle.

With HTML5, we had an anomalous event in that the HTML4 spec was unusable 
as a base, due to its woeful inadequacies in terms of precision in 
implementation requirements, and the large holes in terms of what the 
platform involves relative to what it specified.

Moving forward, I would like to move to a model that is less tied to 
versions. I expect to start looking at this kind of thing next year.
