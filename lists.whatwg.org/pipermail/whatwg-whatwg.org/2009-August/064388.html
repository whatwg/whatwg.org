<PRE>After some internal discussions, I've sent a quite updated proposal which
includes use cases we've looked at (&quot;Global Script&quot;). We've got some
experience of talking with app developers and it seems having a concept of
'application context' or 'global script' is a recurring theme.. The unwanted
serialization and asynchronously in places where developers don't wants them
(think selecting a pice of text in a web application that allows &quot;split
window&quot; view at the document) definitely points that something like a
&quot;Shared Worker&quot; but without a thread and with direct DOM access is a good
idea which compliments the set of building blocks...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Drew: are you thinking that the same object graph also

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> persistence is not a must-have for this use case so the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think ideally serialization would happen only when data needs to be

</I>&gt;<i> windows, I shouldn't have to persist it to accomplish this, and I certainly
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't have to re-serialize it every time I want to make a minor change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, again, I'm just speaking in the abstract - the folks proposing shared
</I>&gt;<i> context (Dmitry) should probably chime in here as they've thought about this
</I>&gt;<i> problem much more than I have.
