There shouldn't be, IMO, if the browser is forbidden to submit them.

&gt;<i> Unlike type=tel, emails have a relatively simply format which *very

They'll probably do that anyway.  HTML 5 doesn't have to mandate it.

&gt;<i> Would you mind sharing these 200 or so that don't validate? &#160;Obviously
</I>&gt;<i> there are privacy concerns, but I think it would be sufficient to just
</I>&gt;<i> replace every alpha character with 'x' and every numeric with '0', or

</I>
I doubt it would be useful.  I summarized all the interesting points,
and remember that these are only 0.007% of the total.  Also, note that
it was 3255 of them that didn't validate.  It was 202 that didn't
validate even after the regex was adjusted to allow whitespace
everywhere (should be equivalent to stripping 0x9, 0xA, 0x20 from
email input).
