</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that those references to works should use &lt;cite&gt;. Doing so

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No, No, NO. That is not what I mean at all. You again deliberately
misrepresent what I am trying to convey, that &lt;cite&gt; should be for
citations, not for a subset of citations.

I agree (and never suggested otherwise): those are in no way explicit
citations, as there is nothing specific about them that would justify
calling them citations. &lt;cite&gt;Pirates of Penzance&lt;/cite&gt;, however is
an explicit reference to that work and therefore a citation, not
&quot;just&quot; a title of the work.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not? An orchestral arrangement is a work, and has a title -- the spec
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly lists &quot;score&quot;, &quot;song&quot;, and &quot;opera&quot; as possible works, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've added &quot;legal case report&quot; to the list, to clarify that you can use
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; to name such reports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

So the definition of &lt;cite&gt; in HTML5 should currently be &quot;title of
work or something that could be construed as a title where one doesn't
exist in the explicit sense of 'title.' But not people's names, even
if they're the citation, because using &lt;cite&gt; for citations is silly.&quot;



&gt;&gt;<i> Unless by &quot;title of work&quot; you mean &quot;standard citation for an item,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually its title&quot;; but then &lt;cite&gt; really means what it is defined as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the HTML 4.01 specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless you have a very loose definition of &quot;citation&quot;, or unless you
</I>&gt;<i> consider a person to be a possible &quot;source&quot;, &lt;cite&gt; in HTML5 is a strict
</I>&gt;<i> superset of HTML4's definition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the following is valid HTML5 but wouldn't be valid HTML4,
</I>&gt;<i> since it's not a citation or reference to another source, but merely
</I>&gt;<i> something mentioned in passing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &lt;p&gt;Today, as I was moving my copy of &lt;cite&gt;Dreamer's Void&lt;/cite&gt;, I
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; hurt my back.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

That's perfectly fine in HTML4. It's a citation, as I have explained
previously, and there's nothing in the HTML4 spec that prohibits that
use. Why are you misrepresenting the HTML4 spec?


&gt;&gt;<i> Besides, there's already &lt;tt&gt;, which could be used to identify &quot;title
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text&quot; or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has the wrong default styles.
</I>

So does &lt;cite&gt;, in many contexts even if we're relying on the
definition in HTML5 as it stands.


&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; is also used to mark up titles that aren't citations, as shown by
</I>&gt;<i> Philip's data.
</I>

Again. Those *are* citations.


&gt;&gt;<i> There's no reason to limit it to a subset of citation (more below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I honestly don't understand how HTML5 is a subset of HTML4 here, unless
</I>&gt;<i> you mean people's names, which as far as I can tell aren't commonly used
</I>&gt;<i> with &lt;cite&gt;, and for which there is no benefit to using &lt;cite&gt;.
</I>

I believe they are more commonly used than you are willing to admit.



&gt;<i> Wikipedia's output is not an argument for consuming &lt;cite&gt;. In fact, what
</I>&gt;<i> they're doing is an argument against keeping &lt;cite&gt; for that purpose: they
</I>&gt;<i> are explicitly overriding the only behaviour &lt;cite&gt; gives them (italics)
</I>&gt;<i> and then going out of their way to reintroduce that effect on a &lt;span&gt;! If
</I>&gt;<i> that's not an argument for changing the meaning of &lt;cite&gt; to something
</I>&gt;<i> more convenient, I don't know what is.
</I>

Yes, Wikipedia's overall markup is problematic, but you seemed to be
needing some actual evidence that &lt;cite&gt; is used for more than simply
&quot;title of work&quot; other than blog commenter names (which for some
inexplicable reason you have rejected out-of-hand as evidence that
&lt;cite&gt; is used for people's names and other non-title citations).



&gt;&gt;<i> Any reference to a title of a work is by definition a citation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore you are limiting &lt;cite&gt; to a subset of citation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with your definition of &quot;citation&quot;.
</I>

I'm sorry the New Oxford American Dictionary isn't good enough for you. I quote:

- a quotation from or reference to a book, paper, or author, esp. in a
scholarly work
- a mention of a praiseworthy act or achievement in an official
report, esp. that of a member of the armed forces in wartime
- a note accompanying an award, describing the reasons for it
- [in Law] a reference to a former tried case, used as guidance in the
trying of comparable cases or in support of an argument



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless you can demonstrate that there is a concrete benefit to doing what
</I>&gt;<i> you describe, I do not think it is a good idea. There are concrete
</I>&gt;<i> benefits to the definition currently in HTML5, namely it provides a good
</I>&gt;<i> first approximation of common typographic effects at a very low cost.
</I>

There is also at least one concrete detriment, in that you are
deliberately limiting the &quot;appropriate&quot; use of an element that you
readily admit is nothing more than a styling hook.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As noted above, I believe that this is an expansion as well (I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> HTML4's use of &quot;source&quot; was meant to include people). But in any case,
</I>&gt;<i> what you describe here isn't a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Clearly, then, the HTML4 authors didn't understand &lt;cite&gt; when they
provided an example that explicitly used the element in junction with
the citation of a name.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the _problem_ solved by allowing names to be marked up in the same
</I>&gt;<i> manner as titles?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Aside from relying on default styles that many user-agents provide,
what's the _problem_ solved by disallowing names from being cited,
especially when not all titles are to be italicized in the first
place?


&gt;&gt;<i> That's what CSS is for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CSS is optional. We need the media-independent layer to make sure that we
</I>&gt;<i> get a reasonable rendering even without CSS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Except that there are many instances when the &quot;default&quot; rendering of
&lt;cite&gt; is inappropriate (and by extension unreasonable) even for
titles of works.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay, but it won't make any difference to authors like myself who will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to use &lt;cite&gt; to mark up names.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can do this either by applying a Kenobian interpretation of the spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. a person is the work of their parents/peers/society and a person's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name is therefore a &quot;title of work&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec explicitly says people's names aren't titles of works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Which won't stop me (and I imagine many others) from using &lt;cite&gt;
appropriately--and contrary to what the specification currently
states.


&gt;&gt;<i> Authors use the &lt;cite&gt; element to mark up names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only a small minority do. Certainly not enough to make this a language
</I>&gt;<i> feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

But in HTML4 it *is* an allowable use of &lt;cite&gt;. I don't think you
have any reasonable justification as to why it is appropriate for you
to take this language feature away.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is often the most semantically appropriate element for marking up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no need to mark up a name at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I don't understand.


&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think it makes sense to ignore the existing behaviour of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Existing behaviour of authors is not to mark up names with &lt;cite&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Except for the authors that do mark up names with &lt;cite&gt;
