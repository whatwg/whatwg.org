The offline app cache allows you to cache the JS and have new releases be 
downloaded in the background while the user uses the old version.

Client-side databases allow data to be cached client-side.

This leaves how to get new data to the client before the client has 
loaded.


&gt;<i> -- Native apps like Outlook can (and do) run background processes on the

</I>
That would be one way to update the cached data before the client runs.


&gt;<i> -- Notifications: Likewise, Outlook can notify users (via a background 
</I>&gt;<i> process) when new mail comes in even if it's not running.
</I>
HTML5 used to have a notifications API, but it was removed due to lack of 
implementor interest.


So there seem to be two problems here:

 - how to update a client-side database in the background when the app 
   isn't loaded, such that the data is up to date when the page is opened,

 - how to pop up notifications while the page is not loaded.

It seems like a direct solution to these would be to have a way for Web 
pages to expose a service that clients could subscribe to, which could 
send up database updates and notifications. That way, no script runs on 
the client, but the server can still update the client whenever needed.

For example, we could base this on the EventSource mechanism or the 
WebSocket mechanism, and define a protocol by which the server can at any 
time send up either:

   An INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE SQL statement
   A string and a URL to show in a notification

The client would then open a connection to this service whenever it was 
open, and the server would update the database and send notifications as 
desired. The UA could then easily show in its UI that a remote server is 
updating data or showing a notification, and make it trivial for the user 
to unsubscribe from the relevant feaure.

This seems far less problematic than background processes, which have a 
host of problems:

 - they have unfortunate implications in multiprocess UAs (see below)

 - they are extremely susceptible to being co-opted for malware, e.g. 
   using CPU resources for computation without the user's knowledge

 - the permission UI is unproven

 - it doesn't really scale when hundreds of sites want to use the feature

 - it's not a good solution for performance problems (see anecdote about 
   Netscape 6 below)

As far as I can tell, we can't ever have a scripting context that can 
access the DOMs of all pages in the same domain, since that would force 
those pages into the same process, which is an assumption that is already 
violated by IE (and, I believe, Chrome).

Also, since anything in the same browsing context typically has to be in 
the same process for sanity (accessing the Window object hierarchy is 
synchronous), and since many sites have &lt;iframe&gt;s to common sites (e.g. ad 
networks) you very quickly end up dragging many sites into the same 
process if you go down this road. So I don't think that's really workable.

It doesn't seem that having a lifetime-limited hidden window would address 
any of the problems listed at the top of this thread:

 - how to update a client-side database in the background when the app 
   isn't loaded, such that the data is up to date when the page is opened,

 - how to pop up notifications while the page is not loaded.

That sounds like shared workers, at that point. Why does this need to be a 
browsing context? If you can't necessarily get to the DOMs of all the 
actual windows, then it doesn't seem like it's worth the pain to make it 
possible to get to the DOMs of any of the windows.

I don't understand why workers can't reduce latency. What is the latency

Shared state is addressed by the Web Storage and Web Database features; 
the shared workers are intended to provide shared computation.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Loading large amounts of Javascript is slow, even from cache.
</I>
The solution is to make loading the JS faster, not to load it and use the 
user's resources regardless.

Consider Netscape 6. It briefly had a &quot;solution&quot; to its slow load times: 
keep the browser always loaded in the background. The users *hated* this 
solution, because it's no solution at all: it just wastes the user's 
resources when he doesn't need them. What's more, the preloaded code ends 
up paging to disk anyway, and then when you need to load the app, it takes 
just as long as it would have to cold-start anyway.

Users don't appreciate software that tries to improve its performance by 
using the user's resources when it's not active.


&gt;<i> 2) Loading application state from the database is slow.
</I>
I don't see how a hidden window can solve this. Could you elaborate?


&gt;<i> 3) Sharing between pages requires going through the database or shared
</I>&gt;<i> worker - you can't just party on a big shared datastructure.
</I>
This would only be solved by a hidden window if the window was accessible 
from all processes, which won't work.


&gt;<i> 4) There's no way to do things like new mail notifications, calendar 
</I>&gt;<i> notifications, local updates of your email inbox, etc when the browser 
</I>&gt;<i> is not open.
</I>
It seems a system dedicated to this could solve this problem in a much 
simpler and more efficient way than running background windows.

I'm not going to design HTML5 around what is easier for GMail to do. If it 
costs Google more to update our apps to use the new features, then so be 
it -- we can afford it. It's more important that the technologies we 
develop here be efficient for new sites going forward than for existing 
sites today, since there will always be more new sites than there have 
been old sites that need updating (unless the Web has peaked!).

It's a lot easier to explain to the user &quot;do you want this Web site to see 
that you are naked&quot; than it is to explain to the user &quot;do you want this 
Web site to be able to do background computation that might be used by 
hostile sites to perform nefarious deeds&quot;.

It was in the spec for a while, but I couldn't get traction on getting 
browsers to implement it. Since WebKit might be adding such a feature

Shared workers are able to solve the same problem.

Given that everything that goes over the wire is serialised, I don't see

Except it doesn't, because we can't guarantee a shared context between all

This seems like a reasonable idea (it's very similar to ideas that have

Realistically speaking, users will soon have many applications open if we
