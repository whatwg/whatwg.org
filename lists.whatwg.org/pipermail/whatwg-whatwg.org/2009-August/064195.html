The idea of the attribute is to ensure the UA has the final say on this 
stuff, rather than having scripts that force buffering by seeking to a 
bunch of places in the file or something equally asinine.

The benefit is that most authors won't notice if they forget to include 
the attribute, and this would lead to stuttering on slow connections.


&gt;<i> What about adding an autobuffer parameter to the constructor which

</I>
I think this would have the same effect as not including the argument at 
all, since most authors wouldn't think about it.

</I>
I think there is some merit to this line of argumentation, yes. I don't 
think it outweighs the concern over sound effects stuttering, though, 
especially since the only disadvantage in the playlist case will be that 
the audio is prebuffered, leading to a better experience in that case too.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's easy to see how some naively implemented JS audio widget could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fetch 200mb over an expensive 3G connection, simply by navigating to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some site in a background tab (say, by creating an array of elements 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to represent their playlist - something I'd have thought was 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; perfectly valid behaviour).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A mobile phone would not autobuffer in a background tab
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3G doesn't mean mobile phone. I barely use my phone's browser, but use 
</I>&gt;<i> net via Bluetooth all the time, various Dell laptops come with 3G 
</I>&gt;<i> available as an option built in, for many in Africa its the only 
</I>&gt;<i> available network, etc.
</I>
Indeed, systems should detect these situations and not autobuffer when 
they apply.
