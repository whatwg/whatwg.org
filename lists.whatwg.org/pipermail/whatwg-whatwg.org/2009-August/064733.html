Lack of compelling use cases.

We could have minlength=&quot;&quot;, but it doesn't seem compelling enough.

Banning words isn't something I think we should be encouraging.

This is possible with maxlength=&quot;&quot;.


&gt;<i> The other types of patterns I can imagine being used include text where

</I>&gt;<i> lists that will be parsed into separate items server-side. Also a 
</I>&gt;<i> pattern to respond to certain words, for example qualifications (e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Doctorate&quot; or &quot;Degree&quot;). Also for spam checking, although as we all 
</I>&gt;<i> know too well it is almost impossible to completely stop the input of 
</I>&gt;<i> unwanted words. IRT also has a couple of script examples involving 
</I>&gt;<i> textareas, however these may be more complex than the spec pattern 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute can handle [1].
</I>
I don't think these really are compelling enough.

I thought we had worked around that with the dirty value flag?

</I>
Indeed. The same argument is used for all features in HTML5.


&gt;<i> I think in general it makes very little sense to say that &lt;textarea&gt;s 
</I>&gt;<i> are different from &lt;input type=text&gt;. Technically the only difference is 
</I>&gt;<i> that one is multiline and the other is not. So it seems like anything 
</I>&gt;<i> that makes sense in &lt;input type=text&gt; makes sense in &lt;textarea&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So for the pattern attribute, a use case would be on a site that accepts 
</I>&gt;<i> US addresses (for example a store that only ships within the US), the 
</I>&gt;<i> site could use a textarea together with a pattern that matches US 
</I>&gt;<i> addresses.
</I>
Show me the correct regular expression for that, then argue with a 
straight face that we should actually have that feature, and I'll add it. :-)

This is handled by &lt;input type=email multiple&gt;.

If we start adding notes for everything that's not in the spec, the spec 
will balloon in size. I don't think that's a workable strategy.
