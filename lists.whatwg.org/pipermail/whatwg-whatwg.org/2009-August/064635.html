&gt;<i> I started writing a detailed rebuttal to Linus's reply, but by the time I
</I>&gt;<i> was finished, many others had already delivered more targetted replies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'll cut the rebuttal format and make a few specific points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Many apps act as a &quot;shoebox&quot; for managing specific types of data, and
</I>&gt;<i> users are used to using these apps to manage that data directly.  See
</I>&gt;<i> iTunes, Windows Media Player, iPhoto, and desktop mail clients as examples.
</I>&gt;<i>  This trend is growing, not waning.  Browsers are already a &quot;shoebox&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> history, bookmarks, and other types of data.
</I>&gt;<i> Claiming that this data is &quot;hidden&quot; from users who are used to handling
</I>&gt;<i> obscure file management scenarios  and therefore we shouldn't fully respect
</I>&gt;<i> it is trying to fit in with the past, not trying to make the future better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - No one is suggesting that UAs not have whatever freedom they want in
</I>&gt;<i> deciding *what* or *how much* to store.  We're only suggesting that once the
</I>&gt;<i> UA has committed to storing it, it *not* be allowed to arbitrarily purge it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - One use of LocalStorage is as a cache for data that is transient and
</I>&gt;<i> non-critical in nature, or that will live on a server.  But another,
</I>&gt;<i> just-as-valid use of LocalStorage is for persistent, predictable storage in
</I>&gt;<i> the client UA that will never rely on anything in the cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - And on that note, if developers don't have faith that data in
</I>&gt;<i> LocalStorage is actually persistent and safe, they won't use it.
</I>&gt;<i> I've given talks on this point 4 times in the last year, and I am stating
</I>&gt;<i> this as a fact, based on real-world feedback from actual, real-world web
</I>&gt;<i> developers:  If LocalStorage is defined in the standard to be a purgable
</I>&gt;<i> cache, developers will continue to use what they're already comfortable
</I>&gt;<i> with, which is Flash's LocalStorage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a developer is willing to instantiate a plug-in just to reliably store
</I>&gt;<i> simple nuggets of data - like user preferences and settings - because they
</I>&gt;<i> don't trust the browser, then I think we've failed in moving the web
</I>&gt;<i> forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I truly hope we can sway the &quot;LocalStorage is a cache crowd.&quot;  But if we
</I>&gt;<i> can't, then I would have to suggest something crazy - that we add a third
</I>&gt;<i> Storage object.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Note that Jens - from Google - has already loosely suggested this)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we'd have something like:
</I>&gt;<i> -SessionStorage - That fills the &quot;per browsing context&quot; role and whose
</I>&gt;<i> optionally transient nature is already well spec'ed
</I>&gt;<i> -CachedStorage - That fills Google's interpretation of the &quot;LocalStorage&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> role in that it's global, and &quot;will probably be around on the disk in the
</I>&gt;<i> future, maybe&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> -FileStorage - That fills Apple's interpretation of the &quot;LocalStorage&quot; role
</I>&gt;<i> in that it's global, and is as sacred as a file on the disk (or a song in
</I>&gt;<i> your media library, or a photo in your photo library, or a bookmark, or...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The names are just suggestions at this point.
</I>

Just for the record, I (now) agree with everything you said here.
