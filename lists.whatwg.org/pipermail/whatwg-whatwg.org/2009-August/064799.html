True, although they can do this to some degree already as has already been
pointed out.   It could also be useful for apps like <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">seti at home</A> to run
something in the browser when the user is idle as well.

I agree that an event model would be a good idea. Having a straightforward
&gt;<i> way to disable wasteful bandwidth usage when the user becomes idle is a good
</I>&gt;<i> thing.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The problem with events is that it would end up being a defined idle time
set for the entire browser, if I am thinking of how the suggestion was to
implement it.  I think this would be limiting, some entities would have
different requirements on idleness.

One issue:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is the user idle when the tab is in the background, when the browser is in
</I>&gt;<i> the background, or when the user is away from the machine? These are all
</I>&gt;<i> distinct cases of different levels of &quot;idleness&quot;, and it's largely depended
</I>&gt;<i> on the use case which kind of &quot;idleness&quot; makes sense for a particular
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True.  I was looking specifically at system idle, which is when the user is
completely away from the machine and not when the task is backgrounded or
minimized.  Detecting this is probably different to idle, since you could be
idle and also be in the foreground or minimized.

Thanks!
David.
