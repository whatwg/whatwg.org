<PRE>I don't think there is consensus at Google yet.
I'm not saying that UAs shouldn't provide file-like lifetime semantics for
storage. I'm just saying the user should decide, not the web page.

Here's one way such a thing could be achieved:

&lt;input type=&quot;storage&quot; src=&quot;button.png&quot; quota=&quot;20GB&quot; /&gt;

When the user clicks the button they see a dialog that mail.google.com would
like to use 20GB of storage. You have 50GB of free space. [Yes] [No]. Script
can't cause the dialog to appear, only a user action. There would also be
some affordance in that dialog to allow the user to
manage persistent storage from other domains. A small &quot;Other sites are using
2GB of storage&quot; link perhaps. AppCache, LocalStrorage, and all other
persistent bits for that domain would live within this quota. UAs would take
this user action as a strong signal that the data is valuable and would act
accordingly.

If web sites use LocalStorage, AppCache, et. al. without the user clicking
on and accepting a storage input button, then the UA would be free to
garbage collect as it sees fit. Good UAs would do a good job of not throwing
away things that are important to the user, just as they do today with
cookies.

</I>&gt;<i> That makes sense to me. There might even be more than two categories:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Cached for convenience - discarding this will affect performance but not

</I>&gt;<i> - Critical for offline use - discarding this will prevent the app storing
</I>&gt;<i> this data from working offline at all.
</I>&gt;<i> - Critical user data - discarding this will lead to permanent user data
</I>&gt;<i> loss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Maciej's 4-level distinction on philosophical grounds, and
</I>&gt;<i> think it's a fine list of use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I think there's been a reasonable amount of agreement on this list that
</I>&gt;<i> it is unnecessarily fine grained.  A developer who is consciously choosing a
</I>&gt;<i> cache will always choose the &quot;most aggressive&quot; cache, and a developer who is
</I>&gt;<i> consciously choose file storage will always choose the &quot;most sacred&quot; file
</I>&gt;<i> storage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we're left with the &quot;cache&quot; vs &quot;file&quot; distinction once more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All browser vendors who have implemented LocalStorage are willing to
</I>&gt;<i> implement the &quot;cache&quot;, because what they've done either meets or exceeds the
</I>&gt;<i> cache use-case.  The remaining question is the file storage.  How do we
</I>&gt;<i> implement this distinction?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like the idea of having &quot;different modes&quot; on LocalStorage.  How
</I>&gt;<i> would the &quot;different mode&quot; be triggered?  How would it be managed?  What
</I>&gt;<i> happens when two applications from the same security origin try to mix
</I>&gt;<i> modes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Different modes&quot; just makes what is already a dirt simple API more
</I>&gt;<i> complex, makes implementation more difficult for browser vendors, and
</I>&gt;<i> confuses web developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I resubmit my three-Storage-object solution:
</I>&gt;<i>  SessionStorage, CacheStorage, and FileStorage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From this discussion, it appears that FileStorage is something Google might
</I>&gt;<i> not be willing to implement.  That's fine!  They can have the object
</I>&gt;<i> available to scripts but just give it a zero quota.  To be more friendly to
</I>&gt;<i> developers and not force them into checking abilities by catching exceptions
</I>&gt;<i> we could add one more property to the storage interface so they can check
</I>&gt;<i> ahead of time whether their attempt to store data will fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Web developers would then have the ability to make the conscious decision
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;Is a cache good enough?&quot; and fallback to CacheStorage, or decide &quot;No, I
</I>&gt;<i> really need persistent data&quot; and fallback to Flash or some other plug-in.
</I>&gt;<i>  The interfaces are all so similar as to be pretty painless for the
</I>&gt;<i> developer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
