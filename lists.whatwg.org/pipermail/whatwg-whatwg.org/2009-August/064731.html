This is because otherwise, if the script has the storage mutex, the user 
can't open any new pages in the entire browser app from any sites that set 
cookies, until he has dismissed the alert. This would prevent him from, 
for instance, going to a URL listed in the alert to check something before 
dismissing the alert.


&gt;<i> It seems like there might be some UA implementation specific ways this

</I>
I'm not aware of any implementation-specific issues with the storage mutex 
that are black-box detectable.


&gt;<i> I don't see why the language should be &quot;must&quot;.
</I>
The idea is to make sure all the browsers do the same thing.


&gt;<i> It's also worth noting that Chromium is probably going to need to drop 
</I>&gt;<i> the storage mutex for most if not all plugin related calls due to 
</I>&gt;<i> deadlock conditions.
</I>
This is required already by the spec.


&gt;<i> Given that different UAs are probably going to have other scenarios 
</I>&gt;<i> where they have to drop the lock (some of them may even be purely 
</I>&gt;<i> implementational issues), should we add some way for us to notify

</I>
Could you list some examples of such cases? I'm not aware of any such 
cases at the moment.

I'd rather not expose the lock to authors at all, if we can avoid doing 
so.


&gt;<i> Lastly, is navigator.getStorageUpdates() the right name for the function 
</I>&gt;<i> that drops the lock?  Why was it changed from navigator.releaseLock()?  
</I>
&quot;What lock?&quot; Authors won't know anything about the storage mutex, so we 
have to describe what the method will appear to do from their perspective.

Generally speaking we want to leave as little black-box detectable 
behaviour as possible undefined.

If you can come up with a viable scenario that would need such a feature, 
then it's worth considering. However, so far it's been mostly a 
theoretical concern. I'd rather not add anything to do with this feature 
if we can avoid it, since we'd like to find a way to drop the whole thing 
in the future, and we want to allow implementors to do optimisations that 
might break assumptions we might make in any API we expose.

Indeed.

yieldForStorageUpdates() maybe?


&gt;<i> StorageMutex is good because that's what its actually affecting.
</I>
Yeah but that's what we want to hide from the author. Only people who read 
the spec with a fine tooth comb are going to know anything about the 
storage mutex.

Workers can't get the storage mutex.

That could work too.


Upon further consideration I've renamed getStorageUpdates() to 
yieldForStorageUpdates().

The HTML5 spec doesn't say what plugins can do, so yes, theoretically a 
plugin could call in whenever it wants. (I don't know if that applies to 
NPAPI plugins.)

Plugins in general have to come with documentation that says how they 
work. All bets are off when a plugin is involved. I wouldn't worry about 
it with respect to this issue.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't understand your point here.  Are you saying that the current

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; window.alert().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know much about this issue, but it seems like something that

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> threaded.
</I>
HTML5 requires that alert() block everything on its thread. (It pauses the 
event loop of the script that is using alert(), which causes all events, 
including user interaction events and timers, to stop being processed on 
that thread.)

Workers can't access cookies.
