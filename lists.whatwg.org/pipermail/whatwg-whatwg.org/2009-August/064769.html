</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Data stored in local storage areas should be considered potentially

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These statements are contradictory, because cookies don't store user-critical
</I>&gt;<i> data such as documents. The user model of cookies is that they're conveniences
</I>&gt;<i> (at best) for keeping you logged into a site or remembering preferences like

</I>
We can't treat cookies and persistent storage differently, because 
otherwise we'll expose users to cookie resurrection attacks. Maintaining 
the user's expectations of privacy is critical.

So I've removed the text that says that local storage could be 
user-critical.

I haven't changed this.

Actually I don't think I'd heard of Flash's LocalStorage at the time that 
localStorage (then globalStorage) was first specced.

The spec leaves all of this up to the UA. It discourages unprompted 
eviction, but at the end of the day, as has been pointed out, there are 
limits to what can be guaranteed.

That's more or less what the spec says, but it uses &quot;should&quot; which allows 
UAs to violate this in &quot;extreme&quot; cases (like abuse being detected, or 
running out of disk space, or whatnot).

UAs can do this, yes.

</I>
In-band systems can be abused, out-of-band systems can be hard to 
discover. I don't know which is worse. We had &lt;bb type=makeapp&gt; for a 
while (an in-band system), but we removed it due to implementor feedback.


&gt;<i> My suggestion to have separate 'important' and 'cache' local storage

</I>&gt;<i> an app tried to put stuff in the 'important' area, you'd be asked for

</I>&gt;<i> consent.
</I>
No need for two cache systems for this -- just have one, and the user 
decides if it's important or not.


Various people suggested adding a Storage object for temporary (&quot;cached&quot;) 
data, which the UA could automatically purge. I expect in a future version 
we'll add expiry dates to keys, and when we do that, we could add a flag 
to the effect of &quot;this can be deleted&quot;. I think this would be better than 
a whole separate object. I also think we should wait on this and see how 
localStorage is used before adding yet more features.

It's worth noting, also, that this solution wouldn't actually remove the 
issue of pages filling up the disk (maliciously or otherwise) and the user 
needing to be prompted for a solution -- expiring old data or something 
else.

</I>
&lt;input type=file&gt; is the &quot;open&quot; case already.

We could add type=save in a future version once we have shown the File API 
to be a success.


&gt;<i> In addition, I'd like to see the pop-up dialogs for the location API

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=&quot;location&quot;&gt; work well instead.
</I>
The geolocation model is asynchronous, which gets around this neatly (the 
UI can slide in and the user can ignore it until he's ready to give his 
location).

</I>
This is an interesting idea. I think it's something we should consider 
once we've seen how localStorage is used in practice. It might not be 
needed enough to justify a language extension; or it might be that we find 
some better asynchronous out-of-band UI.

The problem with JS being able to trigger the prompt is it makes it much 
easier to abuse it (&quot;while (notGotQuota) askForQuota()&quot;).
