<PRE>Thanks for doing this work, Aryeh!  It's really awesome!

Unless you avoid validating *entirely*, there's virtually always going
to be some subset of theoretically valid addresses that you'll flag as
invalid, though.

&gt;<i> So why not have the spec say that in the case of e-mail addresses, the

</I>&gt;<i> address anyway? &#160;If the user is willing to override the warning, then

I'd be okay with this.

&gt;<i> Alternatively, you could just loosen the restrictions even further,
</I>&gt;<i> and only ban input that doesn't contain an @ sign. &#160;(Or that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> match ^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$, or whatever.) &#160;Or just don't ban anything

</I>&gt;<i> types with validity constraints (like month, number, etc.) in that the
</I>&gt;<i> difference between valid and invalid values is a purely pragmatic
</I>&gt;<i> question (what will actually work?) that the user can often answer
</I>&gt;<i> better than the application. &#160;It doesn't seem like a good idea for the
</I>&gt;<i> standard to tell users that the e-mail addresses they've actually been
</I>&gt;<i> using are invalid.
</I>
Unlike type=tel, emails have a relatively simply format which *very
nearly everyone* uses.  I agree that if an email works but is one of
those crazy formats it's probably not a good idea to bar them from
using it, but in practice that's exactly what happens right now with
email validation scripts.  If type=email doesn't validate at all
people will still just continue to use their broken homebrew
validators both on client-side and server-side.

It's possible that a token validation step would be sufficient, but I
suspect not.  Probably just a slight loosening of the allowed format,
informed by actual data such as what you gathered, would work fine,
possibly augmented by your suggestion of making type=email flag
'invalid' addresses but not actually prevent them from being
submitted.

Would you mind sharing these 200 or so that don't validate?  Obviously
there are privacy concerns, but I think it would be sufficient to just
replace every alpha character with 'x' and every numeric with '0', or
some similar information-removing transformation.  None of them fail
validation because of the letters or numbers used, so that would still
give us the information we need without revealing stuff we don't.
