There's a section on it now.

The answer is now &quot;it does not&quot;. ARIA doesn't appear to have enough 
expressive power to be affected by the outline algorithm much, either 
(it's intended for authors, so there's no way to express the nested 
implied sections with it).

</I>
I don't really see how to solve this issue from HTML5's side.

</I>
Should I just say that you can't use these landmark roles on elements from 
HTML5 then?

I don't know how to achieve this.

I've done that.


&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;input type=checkbox role=button&gt;
</I>
This is non-conforming now, but will result in the element appearing to AT 
users as a regular button. (And I guess the user gets really confused if 
they try to activate it.)
