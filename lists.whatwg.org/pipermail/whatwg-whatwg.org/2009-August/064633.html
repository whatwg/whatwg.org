&gt;<i> What seems inevitable are vista-like prompts to allow something (or prods

I hate prompts as much as you.

Flash uses a model where a site can silently store small amounts of data
with no prompts.  Because devices have wildly different storage amounts, one
could imagine a UA on a desktop machine allowing a site to store, say, 2 MB
without prompting, while on a phone the site might only get 20 KB, or maybe
none at all.  This would mean users would be prompted sooner or more often
on a phone, which seems like a reasonable outcome to me given that a phone
may have so little storage that serious use of Local Storage may be
difficult to impossible anyway.

In this world, the hard quotas I suggested become &quot;soft quotas&quot; which result
in some kind of user elevation.  A UA could elect not to elevate and just
deny the additional space if its authors felt that prompts were evil :)

I'm assuming that UA will have out-of-band mechanisms to 'bless' certain
&gt;<i> sites which should not be subject to automated eviction. If push comes to
</I>&gt;<i> shove, the system could suggest cleaning up one of these 'blessed' sites if
</I>&gt;<i> inactivity for an extended period was noticed. But for the overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> number of sites in a users browsing history, its a different matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the storage APIs are just available for use, no questions asked....
</I>&gt;<i> making the storage just go away, no questions asked, is symmetrical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blessing involves asking questions... making it go away does too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If we suggest that the user be prompted before anything be written
&quot;persistently&quot;, there are a couple bad outcomes (note that these are
problems with Gears today):
* The user is asked to make a choice _before_ using the app's functionality,
at which point he is ill-prepared to decide how much he likes the app or
what it should be able to do
* The app author is less-likely to bother to use Local Storage since prompts
drive users away, and just uses Flash

I think the overall UX from requiring &quot;blessing&quot; on all persistent data (as
opposed to on &quot;large&quot; data sets) is poorer.
