</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IRC, IMAP, SSH, and other such protocols?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just like with HTTP, redirects will make it possible to move services to

</I>&gt;<i> tell us that we should allow redirects with cross-site XMLHttpRequest 
</I>&gt;<i> (but I can't enumerate those).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other protocols do not get accessed from Web pages, so transparent

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, since it's likely that WebSocket servers will share ports with

</I>&gt;<i> (including those with Upgrade: WebSocket) will be enough to preserve 
</I>&gt;<i> application functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Redirects surely add a lot of complexity though.
</I>
I've added support for redirects. While I was at it I also added support 
for authentication.

So far I've only changed the client handshake part of this, I expect in 
time I'll update the intro and the server-side part, but I wanted to get 
feedback on the client-side part first.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 11) There is no way for the client to know that the connection has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; closed. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - socket.close() is called from JavaScript;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - onclose handler is invoked;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - more data arrives from the server, and onmessage is dispatched (which I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; think is correct, and it matches what TCP does);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - finally, a TCP FIN arrives, indicating that there will be no more data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the server (the underlying TCP connection is in TIME_WAIT state after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - the client never learns that the server is done sending data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The onclose only fires once the connection has closed, which is after the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TCP FIN, so it happens after the last 'message' event.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this could be clarified in the spec. The current text is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The close() method must close the Web Socket connection or connection 
</I>&gt;<i> attempt, if any. If the connection is already closed, it must do 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing. Closing the connection causes a close event to be fired and the 
</I>&gt;<i> readyState attribute's value to change, as described below.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was reading it as a requirement to immediately change readyState to 
</I>&gt;<i> CLOSED, and to fire a close event. If all this happens asynchronously 
</I>&gt;<i> after the server agrees to close the connection, then my example will 
</I>&gt;<i> work fine, of course.
</I>
The text &quot;Closing the connection causes a close event to be fired and the 
readyState attribute's value to change, as described below&quot; is not 
normative (it has no &quot;must&quot;s in it). It's just letting you know that 
subsequent requirements as described lower in the spec do result in that.

Is there some way I can make that clearer?

It ended up not adding too much, so I just went ahead and added it now.
