<PRE>&gt;<i> Orthodoxy has it that there is no use case for marking up an ancient date
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;fuzzy date&quot; like &quot;June 2009&quot; using &lt;time&gt;. I disagree, and this has
</I>&gt;<i> been discussed many times before. Do you have any concrete use cases or
</I>&gt;<i> examples of how marking these up using &lt;time&gt; would be necessary?
</I>
Whether or not it is useful, wikipedia does it -- a fair number of
4-digit numbers are linked to a page of &quot;things that happened this
year&quot;, but those pages are far from complete -- they often don't even
include the events being linked from.

In theory, that could be done with a span and a class ... but the ad
hoc solutions have clearly been found wanting.

I would sometimes like to search on a date range, as opposed to a
specific date; right now, I'm not sure how to do that cross-domain; if
there were a &quot;time&quot; element, I would expect it to be used often enough
that time searches would be more reasonable.

These may all fail to the 80% rule, but ... they are of at least some
utility, and I'm not sure how much harder it is to support them, given
that &lt;time&gt; will exist, and parsing rules already have to be aware of
such dates to the extent of figuring out what to do for
error-processing.
