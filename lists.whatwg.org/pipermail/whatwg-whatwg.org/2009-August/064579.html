</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting comments. Linus and Jeremy appear to be coming at this from a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pure &quot;cloud&quot; perspective, where any important or persistent data is kept on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a remote server and the browser, so local storage can be treated as merely a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cache. That's definitely a valid position, but from my perspective, much of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the impetus for having local storage is to be able to support *other* application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> models, where important data is stored locally. If browsers are free to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dispose HTML5 local storage without the user's informed consent, such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications become dangerously unreliable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, Linus wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> User agents need to be free to garbage collect any local state. If they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't then attackers (or the merely lazy) will be able to fill up the user's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disk. We can't expect web sites or users to do the chore of taking out the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> garbage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Replace &quot;user agent&quot; -&gt; &quot;operating system&quot; and &quot;local state&quot; -&gt; &quot;user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files&quot;, and you have an argument that, when the hard disk in my MacBook gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too full, the OS should be free to start randomly deleting my local files to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make room. This would be a really bad idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's certainly different from what we're used to.  I'm not convinced
</I>&gt;<i> it's wrong though.  The web has gotten by pretty well with such a model so
</I>&gt;<i> far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But behind the scenes, developers have shoehorned their own data storage
</I>&gt;<i> solutions in to place because there hasn't been a good solution in place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why should an app that is largely about client side experience have to
</I>&gt;<i> store user preferences in cookies and hope they won't be purged, or load a
</I>&gt;<i> plug-in that has reliable local storage, or sync preferences over the cloud
</I>&gt;<i> to a server?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Similar analogies &#8212;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8226; If the SD card in my Wii fills up, should the system automatically start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deleting saved games?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8226; If my iPhone's Flash disk gets full, should it start deleting photos?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if I haven't synced those photos to my iTunes yet?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In each of those cases, what the device actually does is warns you about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the lack of free space, and lets you choose what to get rid of.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's worth noting that today, OSs do a pretty poor job of helping you with
</I>&gt;<i> this task.  (I don't see any reason why the spec will prohibit UAs from
</I>&gt;<i> creating a good UI for this, though.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I completely agree OSs do a pretty poor job of helping with the task.
</I>&gt;<i>  Browsers might be an innovating space here.  I challenge you to come up
</I>&gt;<i> with a great UI for this that shows up in a UA.  I challenge the WHATWG to
</I>&gt;<i> not decide that deleting user data is okay because it's the easiest way
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Local storage is different from cloud storage. The HTML5 storage API can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be used for both, so it shouldn't be limited to what's convenient for just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still don't understand what use local storage has outside of 'cloud
</I>&gt;<i> storage'.  Even in the extensions use case (which I think is out of scope
</I>&gt;<i> for this spec), there's no reason you can't sync user preferences and such
</I>&gt;<i> to the cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once thing I think that HTML5 has made clear is that &quot;web technologies&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> no longer exclusively about &quot;web sites&quot; that exist solely &quot;in the cloud.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  Widgets/gadgets, html-based extensions, offline web applications, and
</I>&gt;<i> native applications that use HTML/JS/CSS to embed parts of their UI are
</I>&gt;<i> *all* covered by HTML5, and I don't think requiring the cloud for any of
</I>&gt;<i> them is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also - and I don't mean this to be flippant, I raise it as a serious point
</I>&gt;<i> - not all web application developers are Google or Apple with access to a
</I>&gt;<i> server infrastructure.  To many web developers, just &quot;throwing data up on a
</I>&gt;<i> server somewhere&quot; is outside the constraints of their resources or their
</I>&gt;<i> design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cloud is within the scope of web technologies, but web technologies
</I>&gt;<i> should not rely on the cloud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, in case it's not clear, my position is not that UAs should take
</I>&gt;<i> deleting user information lightly, my position is 1) this behavior should be
</I>&gt;<i> left up to the UA and 2) when possible, developers should keep information
</I>&gt;<i> in the cloud not local storage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't take my hyperboles too seriously - I don't *seriously* think that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone is suggested browsers should be light hearted about deleting user
</I>&gt;<i> data.
</I>&gt;<i> I think our positions are all pretty clear, and it's coming down to this
</I>&gt;<i> differing philosophy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But my position is:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) If this behavior is left up to the UA, then developers who are using web
</I>&gt;<i> technologies to write applications and they don't want to have to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about &quot;the cloud&quot; for their data are out of luck, because *one* browser that
</I>&gt;<i> is willing to delete data behind the scenes ruins their reliable picture of
</I>&gt;<i> the technology.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Developers should not be *forced* into using the cloud when it is not
</I>&gt;<i> within the scope of what they're trying to develop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I still think there are non-trivial downsides to treating local storage (and
presumable database) data as &quot;sacred&quot;, but I guess I'm convinced that it's
the correct way to go.  I hate throwing UI at problems, but it really does
make a good deal of sense in this case.  Heuristics will still be helpful in
that we can suggest what to delete to the user, but I guess the user should
always make the final decision.

Linus, are you convinced?
