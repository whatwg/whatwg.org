Oh did I? Sorry about that, I didn't mean to.

&gt;&gt;<i>  So you could do some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple synthesis with pure Javascript if it was able to loop through say 100
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arrays of 4410 samples each, doing vector operations on those arrays, in under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 100ms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See attached HTML file.  It creates 103 arrays of length 4410, then goes  
</I>&gt;<i> through them starting with array #4 and sets array n to the product of  
</I>&gt;<i> arrays n-1 and n-2 plus array n-3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I initialize the arrays with random 16-bit integers, the numbers I  
</I>&gt;<i> see are like so (on a year-old laptop):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gecko (build that is pretty close to Firefox 3.6a1):
</I>&gt;<i> Setup: 96ms
</I>&gt;<i> Vector ops: 43ms
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Webkit nightly (in Safari, so using SFX):
</I>&gt;<i> Setup: 170ms
</I>&gt;<i> Vector ops: 41ms
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a Chrome build around to test how well V8 would do on this  
</I>&gt;<i> testcase, and Opera 10 beta is giving me numbers about 20x slower than  
</I>&gt;<i> the above.  Firefox 3 gives numbers about 5x slower than the above.  I  
</I>&gt;<i> can't test IE over here easily (it's a Mac laptop), but I would expect  
</I>&gt;<i> it to be somewhat slower than the above numbers too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I can certainly see how you would feel that ECMAScript is not fast  
</I>&gt;<i> enough for this sort of thing: until recently it wasn't, for the most  
</I>&gt;<i> part.  But at this point it seems to be ok, if not great (I have about  
</I>&gt;<i> 2x headroom for your target numbers for simple sound synthesis over  
</I>&gt;<i> here; someone with an older computer would have less, and more  
</I>&gt;<i> complicated operations might take more time).  And I can tell that at  
</I>&gt;<i> least in Gecko's case there's ongoing work to make array access faster...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems fairly likely to me that all UAs will end up with ECMAScript  
</I>&gt;<i> implementations fast enough to do what you want here sooner than all UAs  
</I>&gt;<i> would implement a brand-new set of functionality.  Certainly that's the  
</I>&gt;<i> case for Safari and Gecko-based browsers.  :)
</I>
For sure, I have no doubt that they'll eventually be fast enough. The thing
with DSP though, is every last vector operation that you can squeeze out of
your CPU is important. I still think it would be worth implementing vector
operators, even if raw ECMAScript is &quot;fast enough&quot;. In your example above, if
there was an operation which took 57ms it would cause stutterring or dropouts
in the sound.

Best,

Chris.
