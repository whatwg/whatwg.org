Are there currently sites using JavaScript to perform the above checks
pre-submission?

If so, would the checks be easier to write using a pattern attribute
than they currently are?  (If they aren't then it seems unlikely authors
would bother with it.)

Are there any such sites already?  If there aren't, it seems unlikely
that the lack of &lt;textarea pattern=...&gt; is what's holding them back.

The point is to have cases specifically _for_ it -- not adding
everything for which there isn't a reason against.

If &lt;textarea pattern=...&gt; wouldn't in practice be used by authors then
there's no point in adding it.  If it would be used then it should be
trivial to show some places where it would be used.
