I'm assuming that you refer to the concept of &quot;structured
clone&quot; now added to <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/.">http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/.</A>

This certainly makes life easier for certain scenarios,
but I don't think it fully addresses Drew's use case.
The problem is that to change the tiniest thing in the
object graph, you will have to get a complete copy of
the data out from the storage provider, apply the change,
and then let it be copied (cloned) back into storage
again.
With Drew's large mailbox + categories example I think
this will be too inefficient. Also, it cannot be divided
into chunks stored under individual keys as that breaks 
object pointers.

Maybe I'm mistaken, but I think Drew wanted handling of
&quot;live&quot; objects, where each window gets access to the same
concrete objects (possibly protected by private proxy
objects) so the graph can be walked without cloning.

Drew: are you thinking that the same object graph also
makes up the data cache between sessions? If not, then
persistence is not a must-have for this use case so the 
area of ideas could well expand outside webstorage.

(Minor note: the Introduction still says that structured
data needs to be handled manually: &quot;To store structured 
data in a storage area, you must first convert it to a 
string.&quot;)

Best regards
