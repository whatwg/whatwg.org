<PRE>Hixie asked:
&gt;<i> What is the problem solved by allowing names to be marked up in the  
</I>&gt;<i> same manner as  titles?
</I>
They are both entities being referenced (cited). It seems arbitrary to  
me to forbid referencing names with the &lt;cite&gt; element. HTML 4 already  
allows it, authors would have to change their existing behaviour  
(something to be avoided wherever possible) and when the meanings of  
other existing elements&#8212;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;small&gt;&#8212;are being *expanded*, I  
can't follow the logic in *restricting* the meaning of an element  
already being used broadly.

&gt;<i> The problem solved by allowing titles specifically to be marked up
</I>&gt;<i> is that titles are usually typographically offset from the surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> text in a distinctive fashion. This doesn't apply to names.
</I>
That's what CSS is for.

&gt;<i> I haven't changed the spec. I continue to hold the position that  
</I>&gt;<i> covering
</I>&gt;<i> titles of works is more useful than covering titles of works and  
</I>&gt;<i> names of
</I>&gt;<i> people, and more useful than covering only names of people or works  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> are explicitly cited.
</I>
Okay, but it won't make any difference to authors like myself who will  
continue to use &lt;cite&gt; to mark up names.

We can do this either by applying a Kenobian interpretation of the  
spec (e.g. a person is the work of their parents/peers/society and a  
person's name is therefore a &quot;title of work&quot;) or we can do it more  
flagrantly by simply disagreeing with the spec&#8212;a precedent for this  
would be the &lt;dl&gt; element in HTML4 where the example in the spec  
showed it being used for dialogue; authors (rightly) ignored the spec.

The meaning of the &lt;cite&gt; element is  a classic example of a &quot;language  
feature&quot; rather than a &quot;platform feature&quot;. &lt;canvas&gt; and &lt;video&gt; are  
examples of platform features i.e. features that require work by  
browser makers to implement. As you have correctly pointed out many  
times, if browser makers refuse to implement a platform feature,  
there's no point having it in the spec; the spec would be fiction.

When it comes to language features, the browser makers don't have to  
do much&#8212;just make sure the element shows up in the DOM. However, if  
authors refuse to implement a language feature as described in the  
spec, then the spec becomes fiction.

Platform features need buy-in from browser makers.

Language features need buy-in from authors.

Authors use the &lt;cite&gt; element to mark up names. It is often the most  
semantically appropriate element for marking up a name (and then in  
itself is a good enough reason to use it&#8212;default browser styling  
doesn't come into it). I don't think it makes sense to ignore the  
existing behaviour of authors.

Authors such as myself will continue to use the &lt;cite&gt; element to mark  
up names; our markup will still be conforming; validators won't flag  
up our choices as errors.

Like I said, you can keep the spec as it is if you want but know that  
that particular part of the spec (detailing usage of the &lt;cite&gt;  
element) will be a work of fiction.

</I>
I agree. I don't think the spec should be micro-managing semantic  
decisions better left to authors.

Let me explain with another example I used on IRC earlier...

Suppose you're marking up a &lt;form&gt;. What element do you use to contain  
your form field and your &lt;label&gt;? Some authors use &lt;div&gt;s. Some  
authors use &lt;p&gt;s. Some authors use &lt;li&gt;s. We could argue (we have  
argued) about which is the most appropriate but in the end, it's the  
author's choice.

Choosing an element to mark up a piece of content isn't always a  
Boolean proposition. Sometimes there is an obvious &quot;correct&quot; choice  
(paragraphs of text should probably be marked up with the &lt;p&gt; element)  
but more often than not, different authors will make different  
choices. And that's okay. Unless it's a flagrant disregard for the  
semantic meaning of the element (e.g. using the &lt;table&gt; element for  
non-tabular content), authors should be allowed to choose what *they*  
feel is the most semantically appropriate element.

I choose to mark up names with the &lt;cite&gt; element. Other authors  
choose not to. We will all continue to exercise our personal choices  
even if the HTML5 spec tries to restrict the meaning of the element.
