Your definition of &quot;citation&quot; is far looser than my dictionary's (&quot;a 
quotation from or reference to&quot;). In fact your definition seems to be 
basically the same as HTML5's -- a title of a work. Unless you think that 
this should be valid use of &lt;cite&gt;:

   &lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;cite&gt;my favourite book&lt;/cite&gt;, and put it next to 
   &lt;cite&gt;the painting I got from my aunt&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't think that those references to works should use &lt;cite&gt;. Doing so 
has zero benefit, as far as I can tell.

</I>&gt;<i> I actually took this information the other way, that there are indeed

</I>
I don't think anyone has argued otherwise. I've only argued that of the 
uses that &lt;cite&gt; is put to, the only ones that are common but have no 
other more appropriate elements (i.e. aren't flat out mistakes) are 
citations and titles, and not people's names.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; A new element wouldn't work in legacy UAs, so it wouldn't be as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My preference would be for &lt;cite&gt; to retain the flexibility it has 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in pre-HTML5 specifications, which would include referencing titles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The flexibility doesn't seem as useful as limiting it to titles. What 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the problem solved by allowing names to be marked up in the same 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manner as titles? The problem solved by allowing titles specifically 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be marked up is that titles are usually typographically offset from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the surrounding text in a distinctive fashion. This doesn't apply to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; names. Reusing the same element for both encourages authors to use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;cite&gt; for both which makes it harder for them to get the right 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typographic effect, leading to a lower quality of typography overall. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this is a bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not just about names. It allows other (non-title) text to be 
</I>&gt;<i> identified as a citation. If &lt;cite&gt; is identified as &quot;title of work,&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> you can't cite many major orchestral arrangements at all, nor can you 
</I>&gt;<i> cite legal decisions.
</I>
Why not? An orchestral arrangement is a work, and has a title -- the spec 
explicitly lists &quot;score&quot;, &quot;song&quot;, and &quot;opera&quot; as possible works, for 
instance.

I've added &quot;legal case report&quot; to the list, to clarify that you can use 
&lt;cite&gt; to name such reports.


&gt;<i> Unless by &quot;title of work&quot; you mean &quot;standard citation for an item, 
</I>&gt;<i> usually its title&quot;; but then &lt;cite&gt; really means what it is defined as 
</I>&gt;<i> in the HTML 4.01 specification.
</I>
Unless you have a very loose definition of &quot;citation&quot;, or unless you 
consider a person to be a possible &quot;source&quot;, &lt;cite&gt; in HTML5 is a strict 
superset of HTML4's definition.

For example, the following is valid HTML5 but wouldn't be valid HTML4, 
since it's not a citation or reference to another source, but merely 
something mentioned in passing:

   &lt;p&gt;Today, as I was moving my copy of &lt;cite&gt;Dreamer's Void&lt;/cite&gt;, I
   hurt my back.&lt;/p&gt;


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If backwards compatibility is that big a concern, why does HTML5 use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;legend&gt; outside of &lt;fieldset&gt; elements?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There were no existing elements that could be reused for many of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new semantics. When there were, we used them (e.g. &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;menu&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that there aren't always existing elements for the new semantics 
</I>&gt;<i> included in HTML5, but I don't believe that backwards compatibility is 
</I>&gt;<i> as big a concern as you claim it is.
</I>
Ok.


&gt;<i> HTML5's re-use of &lt;legend&gt;, for example, is completely broken in every 
</I>&gt;<i> extant browser.
</I>
Yeah, &lt;legend&gt; is a complicated case where a number of factors have 
prevented an ideal solution. (The alternative, introducing yet another 
element that means the same as &lt;legend&gt;/&lt;label&gt;/&lt;caption&gt;/&lt;h1&gt;/&lt;th&gt;/etc, 
is worse, on the long run, than simply waiting a few years to intoduce 
&lt;figure&gt; and &lt;details&gt;.)


&gt;<i> Besides, there's already &lt;tt&gt;, which could be used to identify &quot;title 
</I>&gt;<i> text&quot; or something like that.
</I>
It has the wrong default styles.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the pressing need for an element for citations, which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; would require that we overload &lt;cite&gt; with two uses?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A title can be a citation, but not all citations are titles. What's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the pressing need for limiting &lt;cite&gt; only to titles?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As described above, the need to have an element for titles is that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are typographic conventions that apply to titles. What is the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pressing need for an element for citations, which would require that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we overload &lt;cite&gt; with two uses?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I have said previously, there aren't consistent typographic 
</I>&gt;<i> conventions that apply to titles.
</I>
There are widely used conventions, though, for which &lt;cite&gt; has 
appropriate default styles.


&gt;<i> The &quot;pressing need&quot; is that &lt;cite&gt; is already used to define citations.
</I>
&lt;cite&gt; is also used to mark up titles that aren't citations, as shown by 
Philip's data.


&gt;<i> There's no reason to limit it to a subset of citation (more below).
</I>
I honestly don't understand how HTML5 is a subset of HTML4 here, unless 
you mean people's names, which as far as I can tell aren't commonly used 
with &lt;cite&gt;, and for which there is no benefit to using &lt;cite&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; But why does that have value? How would you use this information?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To collect citation information. I don't see how that as any less value 
</I>&gt;<i> that collecting titles of works, especially since not all works have 
</I>&gt;<i> titles or means of reference that would constitute a conventional 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;title.&quot;
</I>
Virtually nobody either collects citation information _or_ collects titles 
of works. If that is the use case that we have to deal with, then please 
provide evidence that there is actually a significant need for this. So 
far I'm not aware of anyone actually doing this other than Mark Pilgrim, 
and he stopped doing it years ago.

Currently, &lt;cite&gt; in HTML5 isn't for collecting anything, it's purely to 
provide a hook for styling.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Note that HTML5 now has a more detailed way of marking up 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; citations, using the Bibtex vocabulary. I think this removes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the need for using the &lt;cite&gt; element in the manner you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; describe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Since this is supposed to be the case, why shouldn't HTML5 just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ditch &lt;cite&gt; altogether? (Aside from &quot;backward compatibility,&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which is beside the point of the question.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Backwards compatibility (with legacy documents, which uses it to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; mean &quot;title of work&quot;) is the main reason.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'd beg to differ, regarding &quot;legacy documents.&quot; See, for example 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the automated citation generation at Wikipedia: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_templates">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_templates</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What specifically am I looking for here? This doesn't seem to have any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relevance to HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia automatically wraps citations in the &lt;cite&gt; element. View 
</I>&gt;<i> source on any of the Example sections.
</I>
Wikipedia's output is not an argument for consuming &lt;cite&gt;. In fact, what 
they're doing is an argument against keeping &lt;cite&gt; for that purpose: they 
are explicitly overriding the only behaviour &lt;cite&gt; gives them (italics) 
and then going out of their way to reintroduce that effect on a &lt;span&gt;! If 
that's not an argument for changing the meaning of &lt;cite&gt; to something 
more convenient, I don't know what is.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In addition, the comments at zeldman.com use &lt;cite&gt; to reference 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; authors of comments. While that specific example is younger than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; HTML5, this is merely an example of a relatively common use-case for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;cite&gt; that does not use it to signify &quot;title of work.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I said, the most common use of &lt;cite&gt; is to mark up italics. I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agree entirely that it's misused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't said that it's misused. I apologize that you have 
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstood me. I have repeatedly and consistently contended that 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; should be used for more than just titles. I believe that 
</I>&gt;<i> Zeldman's use is perfectly appropriate and correctly used.
</I>
I disagree. I view it as an example of semantic markup for the sake of it. 
We can be more helpful to authors.


&gt;<i> &gt; Blog commenters don't need to be marked up any differently than the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of the comment -- that's a stylistic issue that varies from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blog to blog. I don't see the need for an element specifically for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people commenting on blogs. In most blogs that I've seen, the name 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't even highlighted in any particular fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this isn't just about citing people or &quot;blog commenters&quot;; this 
</I>&gt;<i> was just an example of a current, non-title, and correct use of &lt;cite&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> according to current specifications. (And why does it matter if 
</I>&gt;<i> something is particularly highlighted? Is HTML supposed to be a 
</I>&gt;<i> presentational language? Why limit &lt;cite&gt; to the place of a 
</I>&gt;<i> presentational element?)
</I>
The only use case I'm aware of for &lt;cite&gt; is as a media-independent 
presentation hook, yes.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Existing tools that treat &lt;cite&gt; exclusively as &quot;title of work&quot; do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so against every HTML specification out there (i.e., HTML 4.01 and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; earlier).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Existing tools generally have had very few problems in finding ways to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do things against every HTML specification out there. Over 90% of all 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content on the Web is syntactically invalid in some way, and I'm sure 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that more than 10% of content on the Web is generated by tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and one of those tools is Wikipedia, which wraps entire citations 
</I>&gt;<i> in the &lt;cite&gt; element, not just titles. It correctly follows current 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML specifications in using &lt;cite&gt; to identify a citation.
</I>
Upgrading Wikipedia to HTML5's definitions will simplify Wikipedia. This 
seems like a net win.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed, there is a lot of misuse of the element -- as alternatives 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; for &lt;q&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and HTML5's meaning of &lt;cite&gt;, in particular.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Expanding it to cover the meanings of &lt;q&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, and &lt;em&gt; doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; seem as useful as expanding it just to cover works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I believe you mean &quot;limiting it just to cover works&quot; here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I meant expanding it, since not all titles of works are citations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any reference to a title of a work is by definition a citation. 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore you are limiting &lt;cite&gt; to a subset of citation.
</I>
I disagree with your definition of &quot;citation&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; As a first approximation, titles are italics, and names are not. I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think that's a far closer approximation of typographical conventions 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than lumping titles and names together into one default style.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't seem to be an issue for you with the reuse of &lt;legend&gt; in 
</I>&gt;<i> another context, even though it is broken. So why is it an issue here? 
</I>&gt;<i> (And again, titles are not always in italics.)
</I>
&lt;legend&gt; is an example of the worst possible end result. It's not an 
example of best practice. It's an issue with &lt;legend&gt; also, there are just 
other factors at work there.


&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't changed the spec. I continue to hold the position that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covering titles of works is more useful than covering titles of works 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and names of people, and more useful than covering only names of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people or works that are explicitly cited.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are misconstruing my argument. This isn't about including names of 
</I>&gt;<i> people; that is just the most obvious non-title form of citation. This 
</I>&gt;<i> is about properly understanding what a citation can be and writing the 
</I>&gt;<i> specification for the &lt;cite&gt; element to account for those possibilities. 
</I>&gt;<i> Citations are references to works, people, etc. By limiting it to &quot;title 
</I>&gt;<i> of work&quot; you are actually limiting it to a subset of a subset, as many 
</I>&gt;<i> objects worth citing don't have conventional titles.
</I>
Unless you can demonstrate that there is a concrete benefit to doing what 
you describe, I do not think it is a good idea. There are concrete 
benefits to the definition currently in HTML5, namely it provides a good 
first approximation of common typographic effects at a very low cost.

As noted above, I believe that this is an expansion as well (I don't think 
HTML4's use of &quot;source&quot; was meant to include people). But in any case, 
what you describe here isn't a problem.

What is the _problem_ solved by allowing names to be marked up in the same 
manner as titles?


&gt;<i> &gt; The problem solved by allowing titles specifically to be marked up is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that titles are usually typographically offset from the surrounding

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's what CSS is for.
</I>
CSS is optional. We need the media-independent layer to make sure that we 
get a reasonable rendering even without CSS. (Otherwise, why wouldn't we 
just be using &lt;span&gt; for everything?)


&gt;<i> Okay, but it won't make any difference to authors like myself who will

The spec explicitly says people's names aren't titles of works.


&gt;<i> When it comes to language features, the browser makers don't have to do

</I>&gt;<i> the spec becomes fiction.
</I>
Agreed; that's why I base a lot of the spec on research about what authors 
are doing. In practice, most authors aren't marking up names with &lt;cite&gt;.


&gt;<i> Authors use the &lt;cite&gt; element to mark up names.
</I>
Only a small minority do. Certainly not enough to make this a language 
feature.


&gt;<i> It is often the most semantically appropriate element for marking up a

</I>
There is no need to mark up a name at all.


&gt;<i> (and then in itself is a good enough reason to use it

No, that's a cargo-cult approach to semantic markup.


&gt;<i> I don't think it makes sense to ignore the existing behaviour of

</I>
Existing behaviour of authors is not to mark up names with &lt;cite&gt;.


&gt;<i> Authors such as myself will continue to use the &lt;cite&gt; element to mark

Your markup won't be conforming, though you are correct that the validator 
won't catch this error.
