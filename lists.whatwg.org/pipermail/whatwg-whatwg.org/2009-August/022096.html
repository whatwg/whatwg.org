I was assuming that they don't want to follow unnecessary links.  For
instance, their spiders can likely only make X requests per second to
each domain (due to robots.txt or generic &quot;don't be a jerk&quot; policies),
and if the spiders are forced to make a large number of useless
requests then their indexing of any given site will be slowed down.

I'm not clear on what it means that you &quot;must assume&quot; something,
actually.  An assumption, by definition, might be discarded at any
point if more evidence comes in, so a required assumption sounds
oxymoronic.  Anyway, assumption is a state of knowledge rather than an
actual action, so I can't figure out what the requirement means in
practice.

At this point the user agent seems to have only one choice to make:
fetch the resource, or don't.  Whether to fetch the resource is, as
you point out, explicitly a &quot;should&quot; requirement.  So what's the &quot;must
assume&quot; requirement meant to add?  Are there other decisions the user
agent has to make before it has the resource available?

&gt;<i> For Web browsers, this problem only occurs if at least one major browser
</I>&gt;<i> violates the spec. Until one does, the browsers can just refuse to render
</I>&gt;<i> the site -- since all the browsers will be doing the same thing, the site
</I>&gt;<i> cannot legitimately blame the browers.
</I>
Unless the problem is non-obvious to authors but significant to some
consumers (but not enough to make authors widely aware of it).  My
hypothetical scenario had authors providing an incorrect type=&quot;&quot;
attribute.  Perhaps all browsers supported both types anyway, so they
retrieved the resource thinking it was type X, then determined it was
type Y and processed it as that with no errors being raised.  But then
if one browser (or search engine, etc.) happens to support type Y but
not type X, you get bugs.

Another example that I think you yourself have mentioned in the past
is Opera's mobile version.  It deliberately mangles display in a
nonstandard fashion to better fit on a small screen.  Again, here the
problem isn't obvious to most authors (since they didn't test on small
screens), but the implementor is able to improve experience for a
significant market of consumers if they ignore the standards.

&gt;<i> Probably a little (forms have been pretty successful despite a horrible
</I>&gt;<i> styling story for over a decade)
</I>
Because it's impossible to achieve the same functionality as forms --
dynamically building a GET request based on user input, or any POST
request at all -- any other way without requiring JavaScript.  (Which
locks out some users, and is harder to write.)  And until a few years
ago, when XHR became widely supported, AFAIK it wasn't possible to
permit POSTs (necessary for large amounts of input, for instance) even
with JavaScript.
