Woo, at least one person understands what's going on with the event loop 
design!

I'm pretty sure your interpretation is correct. I'm not really sure 
whether to consider it a problem or not. It's a problem only if both ports 
are owned by the same owner on each end (i.e. port1 and port2 are owned by 
the same owner, obviously, but also port1' and port2' are owned by the 
same owner, though maybe a different owner than port1 and port2).

I don't really see any way around it. We can't really make the task source 
for ports be dependent on who the other end's owner is, because that might 
change asynchronously without the other owner knowing much about it.
