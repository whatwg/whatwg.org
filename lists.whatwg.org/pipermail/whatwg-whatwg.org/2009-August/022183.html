This part begs a couple more questions :-)

What you're essentially saying here is that when restarting
the browser, you will also restore history data, correct?

For tabs that were open when the browser was closed, this 
will mean that these will reappear after restart with full 
history, being able to go Back and restore state on
previous pages?

But for pages that were explicitly closed, and then 
navigated to in a &quot;new&quot; tab, will you restore the full
history in these as well? And is that really desired from
a user pov? (It seems you will be haunted by the same page
history forever, even if the corresponding server state
expired a long time ago.)

And if there has been several sessions in parallel on that
URL space, which one do you respawn for a navigation to a 
related page in a new tab?

Best regards
Mike
