I don't see the utility in this level of granularity.  Two levels seem
fine: delete at will as long as the app isn't actually running, and
never delete once stored without explicit user action.

&quot;Dispose when you feel like it&quot; storage doesn't provide any better
protection for the user -- the site can always reset it regularly when
the user visits.  Cookies are already widely used for tracking, and
work fine.  Flash localStorage is used for tracking mainly because
users don't know how to clear it, I suspect, not because it's more
persistent than cookies in practice.  (One of the many reasons HTML 5
needs to kill Flash.)

&gt;<i> This seems to me a better idea than having multiple storage areas (SessionStorage, CachedStorage and FileStorage as suggested by Brady).

</I>
The decision needs to be made by the app.  The app knows whether it's
just doing caching, or needs persistence.  The UA doesn't know, and
nor does the user.

I expect that as with cookies, the default in most browsers would be
to let the app decide how long it wants to store the data with no user
interaction, but privacy-aware users would be able to get more
control.  I also think it's clear that localStorage would not persist
after things like exiting privacy mode, or logging out of a public
terminal (if correctly configured), or clicking a &quot;clear private data&quot;
button (if that also cleared bookmarks/history/etc.).  Nobody's saying
&quot;store forever&quot;, just &quot;don't delete except by explicit user request&quot;.

&gt;<i> So, to what extent do people think that automatic decisions could be made by the UA and app regarding the criticality of a particular piece of data?
</I>
I think &quot;criticality&quot; is the wrong word to use.  &quot;Persistence&quot; is
better.  Persistent data may be unimportant, and transient data may be
critical.
