I suppose it is a matter of taste how to describe this. I'll give you my
impression.

I was trying to find out what restrictions we are putting on the year part
of the string. E.g. are we allowing years before the year 0 and how. I went
into the table of content and wasn't able to find anything about year, but
only about month and date etc. By working backwards from the date, I found
that the &quot;year string&quot; was defined under the &quot;month&quot; paragraph. I was rather
frustrated by that time. Similarly with the format of the &quot;day string&quot; (i.e.
the &quot;day&quot; part of the string, though that was much more obvious.

It's all there, and it's all fully defined by recursive definition of the
parts that are being re-used (e.g. date reuses month (which is month-year,
but not just month). However, if you are trying to look for something, it's
rather confusing not to have e.g. year and day exposed in the contents,
while month is.

As I said - a matter of taste - and possibly usability.

Regards,
Silvia.
