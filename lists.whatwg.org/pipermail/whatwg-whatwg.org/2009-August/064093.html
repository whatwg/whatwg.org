<PRE>2009/7/30 Ian Fette (&#12452;&#12450;&#12531;&#12501;&#12455;&#12483;&#12486;&#12451;) &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">ifette at google.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;&gt;<i> That being said, I think there are valid use cases for out-of-band
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notifications, for example for calendar events or &quot;status update&quot; type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications such as Facebook or Twitter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to explore whether we can accommodate this notification use case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without bringing the full power of the Web platform to bear, and thereby
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening up a lot of attack surface on the client. Here's one rough sketch of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an idea:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Notification Feeds *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Often, web applications would like to give users the option to subscribe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to notifications that occur at specific times or in response to server-side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> events, and for the user to get these UI notifications without a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prerequisite that the web app is open or that the browser is running. There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may be a desire to do client-side computation as well, but often just the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability to give the user a notification solves the basic user interaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One possible way to address this kind of use case is to let users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subscribe to a &quot;feed&quot; of notifications. This feed could use standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> syndication formats, such as RSS or Atom. But instead of being displayed in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a traditional feed reader, it's displayed in the form of transient
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notifications (along the lines of Growl on Mac OS X) which are posted for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each new event. To allow some pre-scheduling of events, each item can have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> date and won't be displayed until that date - this way a calendar can give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you your feed of upcoming events and you can still get notifications when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offline. In the case of something like email or Twitter, obviously there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no sensible way to get notifications when offline since they depend on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unpredeictable server-side activity. There could even be a client-side API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that lets a Web app schedule items on a subscribed notification feed from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> script, to enable scheduling calendar events offline. Each notification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would have the option to unsubscribe from the notification feed, to reduce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spam potential.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Notice that this opens up a lot less attack surface. The user has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actively opt in to subscribing to the notification feed, just as for an RSS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feed. This makes it much less likely they end up with a subscription to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shady site. And the notifications are passive data items (probably no script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be allowed in a notification, if the format is HTML and not just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plain text), so they open up a lot less security risk. Obviously this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less powerful than the ability to run arbitrary code in the background. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it could address a large chunk of the use cases with much less security
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It addresses some use cases (calendar, perhaps), but I would still like to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to e.g. keep my email up to date. Do I need the &quot;full power&quot; /
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fully general&quot; solution? I don't know, perhaps the push mechanism can be
</I>&gt;<i> structured in a way that it gets into my database or whatever storage
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism I am using for offline data storage?
</I>
I agree, however I don't think the solution is to allow a background
webpage or something similar which has the full power of the web
platform, and all the naughty things available to it. Instead I think
it'd be great to have a protocol which allowed asynchronous updates to
a client-side resource (or set of resources). There's nothing that
would prevent this from happening over non-http protocols as well
(such as SMS).
