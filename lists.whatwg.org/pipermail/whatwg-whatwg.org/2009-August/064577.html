</I>
The current spec is about &quot;Web Applications&quot; of all forms, including  
those that are offline, and others that hope to break from from the  
*required* chain to the cloud.

Extensions based on web technology are just one form of this.  Widgets/ 
gadgets are another.  Stand alone web applications are yet another.   
Native applications that integrate HTML for their UI are another still.

</I>&gt;<i> Interesting comments. Linus and Jeremy appear to be coming at this  
</I>&gt;<i> from a pure &quot;cloud&quot; perspective, where any important or persistent  
</I>&gt;<i> data is kept on a remote server and the browser, so local storage  
</I>&gt;<i> can be treated as merely a cache. That's definitely a valid  
</I>&gt;<i> position, but from my perspective, much of the impetus for having  
</I>&gt;<i> local storage is to be able to support other application models,  
</I>&gt;<i> where important data is stored locally. If browsers are free to  
</I>&gt;<i> dispose HTML5 local storage without the user's informed consent,  
</I>&gt;<i> such applications become dangerously unreliable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, Linus wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> User agents need to be free to garbage collect any local state. If  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they can't then attackers (or the merely lazy) will be able to fill  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up the user's disk. We can't expect web sites or users to do the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chore of taking out the garbage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Replace &quot;user agent&quot; -&gt; &quot;operating system&quot; and &quot;local state&quot; -&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;user files&quot;, and you have an argument that, when the hard disk in  
</I>&gt;<i> my MacBook gets too full, the OS should be free to start randomly  
</I>&gt;<i> deleting my local files to make room. This would be a really bad idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's certainly different from what we're used to.  I'm not  
</I>&gt;<i> convinced it's wrong though.  The web has gotten by pretty well with  
</I>&gt;<i> such a model so far.
</I>
But behind the scenes, developers have shoehorned their own data  
storage solutions in to place because there hasn't been a good  
solution in place.

Why should an app that is largely about client side experience have to  
store user preferences in cookies and hope they won't be purged, or  
load a plug-in that has reliable local storage, or sync preferences  
over the cloud to a server?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similar analogies &#8212;
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; If the SD card in my Wii fills up, should the system automatically  
</I>&gt;<i> start deleting saved games?
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; If my iPhone's Flash disk gets full, should it start deleting  
</I>&gt;<i> photos? What if I haven't synced those photos to my iTunes yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In each of those cases, what the device actually does is warns you  
</I>&gt;<i> about the lack of free space, and lets you choose what to get rid of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's worth noting that today, OSs do a pretty poor job of helping  
</I>&gt;<i> you with this task.  (I don't see any reason why the spec will  
</I>&gt;<i> prohibit UAs from creating a good UI for this, though.)
</I>
I completely agree OSs do a pretty poor job of helping with the task.   
Browsers might be an innovating space here.  I challenge you to come  
up with a great UI for this that shows up in a UA.  I challenge the  
WHATWG to not decide that deleting user data is okay because it's the  
easiest way out.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Local storage is different from cloud storage. The HTML5 storage API  
</I>&gt;<i> can be used for both, so it shouldn't be limited to what's  
</I>&gt;<i> convenient for just one of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still don't understand what use local storage has outside of  
</I>&gt;<i> 'cloud storage'.  Even in the extensions use case (which I think is  
</I>&gt;<i> out of scope for this spec), there's no reason you can't sync user  
</I>&gt;<i> preferences and such to the cloud.
</I>
Once thing I think that HTML5 has made clear is that &quot;web  
technologies&quot; are no longer exclusively about &quot;web sites&quot; that exist  
solely &quot;in the cloud.&quot;  Widgets/gadgets, html-based extensions,  
offline web applications, and native applications that use HTML/JS/CSS  
to embed parts of their UI are *all* covered by HTML5, and I don't  
think requiring the cloud for any of them is necessary.

Also - and I don't mean this to be flippant, I raise it as a serious  
point - not all web application developers are Google or Apple with  
access to a server infrastructure.  To many web developers, just  
&quot;throwing data up on a server somewhere&quot; is outside the constraints of  
their resources or their design.

The cloud is within the scope of web technologies, but web  
technologies should not rely on the cloud.

&gt;<i> By the way, in case it's not clear, my position is not that UAs  
</I>&gt;<i> should take deleting user information lightly, my position is 1)  
</I>&gt;<i> this behavior should be left up to the UA and 2) when possible,  
</I>&gt;<i> developers should keep information in the cloud not local storage.
</I>
Don't take my hyperboles too seriously - I don't *seriously* think  
that anyone is suggested browsers should be light hearted about  
deleting user data.
I think our positions are all pretty clear, and it's coming down to  
this differing philosophy.

But my position is:
1) If this behavior is left up to the UA, then developers who are  
using web technologies to write applications and they don't want to  
have to worry about &quot;the cloud&quot; for their data are out of luck,  
because *one* browser that is willing to delete data behind the scenes  
ruins their reliable picture of the technology.
2) Developers should not be *forced* into using the cloud when it is  
not within the scope of what they're trying to develop.
