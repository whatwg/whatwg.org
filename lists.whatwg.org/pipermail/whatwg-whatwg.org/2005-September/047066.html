Those are definitely the goals of the WebApps WG. That of course leaves 
a lot of room for disagreement, but then that's what WGs are for ;)

&gt;<i> It is encouraging to note that the Web Apps WG's charter explicitly states

It is indeed our firm intention to have as high as possible commonality 
in goals and work with the WHATWG. After all, if all the Good Guys 
splinter off into their own corners instead of talking to one another to 
solve their artistic differences, we're all of us screwed.

&gt;<i> (Just out of interest, where did you see the announcement? It has been W3C

</I>
Likewise, I checked the W3C site and haven't seen anything. The voting 
period ended yesterday but the results have not been announced, and I'm 
fairly sure that nothing is officially known. Notably, the charter you 
cite may have been modified based on membership feedback, so I would 
strongly advise caution as to the deliverables you mention.
