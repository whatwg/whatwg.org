</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I may want to use the same form to present the data to users with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>read-only permissions. This could be accomplished by setting the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>disabled attribute on the form. This would make all data visible but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>readonly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Disabled attributes are not successful and won't be processed when the user
</I>&gt;<i> submits the form. Secondly disabled form elements do not receive focus and are
</I>&gt;<i> skipped in tabbing navigation. In this use case those elements should be
</I>&gt;<i> processed when the user submits the form (is this true?).
</I>The read-only user shouldn't be able to submit the form at all (in this
case I assume that form submission is a write action). So whether they
are successful or not is not important, because the form is never
submitted.

&gt;<i> Disabled applies to
</I>&gt;<i> all elements except a few. Readonly does not nearly apply to all form elements;
</I>&gt;<i> radio buttons, checkboxes, file uploads etc. are excluded.
</I>In this use case, the user shouldn't be able to enter use the file
upload or change the state of radio buttons or checkboxes. I has been
argued elsewhere on this mailinglist that radio buttons and checkboxes
should not have a readonly state, so that only leaves the disabled state.


I guess it would make the most sense if the whole form acted as if it
were disabled, but looked as if it were readonly.
