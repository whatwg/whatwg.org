   Nothing in a print out does anything. If you're using events like
|<i>onbeforeprint| and |onafterprint|, CSS is still good as a fallback for
</I>browsers that support CSS but not the events. Then again, the user could
just do this:

|<i> // Code to prepare the DOM for printing.
</I>|<i> window.print();
</I>|<i> // Code to restore the DOM after printing.
</I>
   That's, of course, assuming that window.print() halts the script
until it's complete. Then again, if the browser is printing from a
static copy of the DOM rather than the DOM itself, it may not matter. I
guess it depends on how window.print() is defined and what the
implementation does.

&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> course it's still possible with the method in the OP's post that the
</I>&gt;<i> user gets a nothing link, but that doesn't mean the link existing in
</I>&gt;<i> the source is a good idea.
</I>
   How many user agents support Javascript but not CSS1? Does Lynx or
some other text-mode browser support Javascript? I'll have to look into
that...

&gt;&gt;<i>3) How does your original example even prevent the content from being

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that's the purpose, I think the purpose is to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> there's not content in the page which is purely behavioural and does

</I>
   Makes sense. Personally, I'm wondering why you want to print from a
link at all unless you want to perform a special print operation.
