but quite obvious to people who use the IEAK to customise IE's for

Definately, if you disable stylesheets, you should disable
stylesheets, just disabling particular media ones is flawed.

&gt;<i> &gt; I couldn't see the relevance of browsers which didn't support both, as

</I>&gt;<i>   If having a Javascript-capable browser effectively means that you

</I>
but it doesn't mean that... CSS is optional, as is javascript, there's
no relationship between the 2 things.  Don't fall in the trap of
thinking we're specifying things for the standard configurations of
current browsers - that's how you make the web more inaccessible for
people.

&gt;<i>then you don't need additional Javascript in
</I>&gt;<i> order to hide the button when printing. 
</I>
This has never been what I've been discussing - the hiding of the
button is when script is disabled or printing functionality not there
- it's got nothing to do with hiding the button when it is printed,
it's purely to do with not having a control on the screen which does
nothing.

&gt;<i>   I can't find that recommendation in CSS1. 
</I>
It's at the end of section 7

&gt;<i>As a matter of fact, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think CSS1 has media types or print-specific properties. 
</I>
no, it's purely talking about disabling css.

Jim.
