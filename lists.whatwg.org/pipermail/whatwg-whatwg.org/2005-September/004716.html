Cool.


&gt;<i> It also includes Element.hasClassName(), Element.addClassName() and

</I>
I envisage somehow making className implement the DOMTokenString 
interface:

   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#domtokenstring">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#domtokenstring</A>

...so that you would have Element.className.add(), 
Element.className.has(), etc.


&gt;<i> Given these HTML elements:

A-D are equivalent, E-G are equivalent, H, I, and J are different.

Correct.

</I>&gt;<i> 07. getElementsByClassName(&quot;foo bar&quot;);    | E, F
</I>
Incorrect; none of the above elements are in classes that have a space 
character in the class name.

</I>
There are a number of other methods (e.g. in &lt;canvas&gt; and XMLHttpRequest) 
that use variable numbers of arguments. Why would it cause a problem?


&gt;<i> Functions with variable number of arguments are problematic in some 
</I>&gt;<i> programming languages, and because of that W3C may not want to include 
</I>&gt;<i> such method in future DOM specfications.
</I>
While it is true that some languages do not support methods with variable 
numbers of arguments, that is not a reason to limit ourselves here. It is 
quite possible for those languages to have language bindings that define 
different names for these methods, or use arrays as the arguments. For 
example, Java's DOM bindings convert attributes to methods to get around 
Java's lack of attributes.


&gt;<i> Such design forbids any extensibility as well - it won't be possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> add new optional parameters to that function.
</I>
This line of argument seems to conflict with the suggestion that we can't 
have variable numbers of arguments.

In any case, should we need to extend this function, we can always 
introduce a new function.


&gt;<i> I suggest that getElementsByClassName() should take only one parameter: 
</I>&gt;<i> string of space-separated class names. This may simplify implementation, 
</I>&gt;<i> because same algorithm can be used to get list of class names from input 
</I>&gt;<i> and from elements.
</I>
I fear that if we use a string that must be parsed, we will encourage 
buggy implementations. It also introduces many edge cases -- trimming 
spaces from the start or the end, and so forth.

And it means that should a language ever introduce classes with spaces in 
them, we will be unable to search for them.


&gt;<i> It will also solve IMHO unclear case of getElementsByClassName(&quot;foo 
</I>&gt;<i> bar&quot;) matching &quot;bar foo&quot;. It would, as opposed to behavior where space 
</I>&gt;<i> is both separator and part of class name.
</I>
What if an element is in the class &quot;foo bar&quot;?


&gt;<i> In currently proposed implementation getElementsByClassName(&quot;foo bar&quot;) 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't match class=&quot;bar foo&quot;, but matches class=&quot;foo bar&quot;. This implies 
</I>&gt;<i> that class attribute isn't just space-separated list of classes.
</I>
In the current specification, getElementsByClassName(&quot;foo bar&quot;) matches 
neither class=&quot;bar foo&quot; nor class=&quot;foo bar&quot;.


&gt;<i> That's why I propose to make this function use exactly the syntax that 
</I>&gt;<i> class attribute uses. getElementsByClassName(&quot;bar foo&quot;) should match 
</I>&gt;<i> class=&quot;foo bar&quot;, class=&quot;bar baz foo&quot;, etc.
</I>
I fear that this would be rife with implementation bugs, as opposed to 
requiring the author to pre-split the search input, which guarentees that 
the UA does not have to process the search input in any way, only having 
to deal with the actual class attribute.

Yeah, the draft notes that we should probably have that as well (or 
instead).

The spec now defines this better. Basically, &quot;foo bar&quot; would never match 
anything in HTML, XHTML, MathML or SVG.


&gt;<i> Before I can fix the implementation in any way, I need to know how white

</I>
The spec doesn't mention trimming, so, no trimming. :-)


&gt;<i> (&quot;foo bar&quot;) could basically be handled in the following ways and I need

</I>&gt;<i> 2. The way it currently works. ie. matches &quot;foo bar&quot;, not &quot;bar foo&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Error, return nothing.
</I>
It's not an error per se, but it would return nothing with the languages 
your script currently supports.

I agree.

What is the problem with allowing multiple arguments in JS?

If a UA implementor wishes to implement this in something other than JS, 
please let me know, so that I can include language bindings for that 
language in the spec. As it stands, there will always be languages that 
have problems implementing these APIs literally. Even, e.g., Java, has 
problems implementing the DOM literally (there are no native object 
attributes in Java, as I understand it).

IMHO that would lead to more implementation bugs as implementations would 
find it hard to implement exactly the same processing for the argument. A 
list of strings to use literally seems more useful.
