Thanks for your feedback!

Diffs from what you read to what the spec says now are available at:

</I>
Added a note to this effect.


&gt;<i> 3.4.2 &quot;other objects&quot; this is entirely ECMAscript specific, is it not? 
</I>
Not necessarily; I would expect a Perl binding to support this kind of 
thing for Perl hashes. Having said that, note that HTML5 in general has a 
strong JS bias, since JS is the Web's main language.


&gt;<i> How can this work across language bindings? It might be a lot simpler 
</I>&gt;<i> for everyone to only specify storage for DOM types.
</I>
It might be simpler for implementors, but I really think authors would 
want to be able to do things like:

   globalStorage[document.domain].username = username;
   globalStorage[document.domain].lastVisit = new Date();
   globalStorage[document.domain].game = {
     name: 'fred',
     level: 42
   };

...and so forth. Having to wrap stuff like that in E4X XML or (worse) DOM 
nodes just seems like an excessive amount of boxing.
   

&gt;<i> 3.4.6.1 &lt;<A HREF="http://3.4.6.1">http://3.4.6.1</A>&gt; &quot;The space limits on public storage areas should 
</I>&gt;<i> not affect the limits for non-public domains, however.&quot;
</I>
Changed that to a new suggested model based on the domain of the script 
setting the data, not the domain of storage area. Let me know what you 
think.


&gt;<i> Of course grabbing lots of domain names isn't unthinkable so UAs will 
</I>&gt;<i> probably need additional mechanisms to manage quota. Some more 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of this problem would be helpful.
</I>
Added a paragraph on this.


&gt;<i> 3.4.6.2 &lt;<A HREF="http://3.4.6.2">http://3.4.6.2</A>&gt; Is it obvious what &quot;run to completion&quot; means 
</I>&gt;<i> for a script? I think here you need to say that the intended semantics 
</I>&gt;<i> is that *as far as scripts can tell*, there is no concurrent script 
</I>&gt;<i> execution, and hence no concurrent access to storage objects, and any 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation technique that preserves this is allowed. If that's not 
</I>&gt;<i> the intended semantics, it should be! The behaviour currently described 
</I>&gt;<i> is one such technique but there could be others (e.g., optimistic 
</I>&gt;<i> transactional script execution).
</I>
Changed that section to cover this.


&gt;<i> Two things that I didn't see that I think should be mentioned; apologies if 
</I>&gt;<i> they are:
</I>&gt;<i> -- From the security discussion, it's obvious that UAs are permitted to 
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrarily discard persistent storage data. This should be stated up-front. 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly *when* is such discarding permitted, though?
</I>
I have added text about this to the sessionStorage and globalStorage 
sections. (Short answer: sessionStorage: only when the window is closed or 
when you run out of disk space; globalStorage: only when the user says so. 
And in both cases, security concerns can trump everything and be used as 
an excuse to delete data whenever...)


&gt;<i> -- There should be some atomicity property that authors can rely on to 
</I>&gt;<i> safely update storage under potential failures (of the UA, or the 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware, or whatever). It's probably enough to require that setItem and 
</I>&gt;<i> removeItem are atomic with respect to failure. In other words, if the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> fails during a setItem or removeItem, then later the operation will be 
</I>&gt;<i> observed to either have succeeded normally or not happened at all (and 
</I>&gt;<i> of course the storage object will not be corrupted!).
</I>
Good call. Added. Let me know if what I added is enough, though.


Thanks a ton for your help. Please let me know if you disagreed with 
anything here, in particular about the serialising objects vs only 
serialising DOM nodes thing.
