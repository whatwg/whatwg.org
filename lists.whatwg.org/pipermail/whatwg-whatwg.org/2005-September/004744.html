That's vaguely what I ended up doing, though I actually did allow Nodes as 
well by special-casing them. (Haven't mentioned Arrays though, should I?)


&gt;<i> A web page with an URL should be &quot;reentrant&quot;, e.g. if you bookmark it 
</I>&gt;<i> and visit it later, it should work. Pages which is dependent on info 
</I>&gt;<i> generated on other pages should either have that info encoded in the 
</I>&gt;<i> URL, or be accessed through a POST request. In the first case, the 
</I>&gt;<i> context is preserved, in the second the page can't (easily) be 
</I>&gt;<i> bookmarked and revisited, since browsers treats pages which is the 
</I>&gt;<i> result of a POST request differently, which avoids the problem of the 
</I>&gt;<i> missing context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ordinary web sites are usually &quot;stateless&quot; in the sense that you can 
</I>&gt;<i> visit the pages in any order. Stateful transactions (like payment) are 
</I>&gt;<i> usually handled as a sequence of POST's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Web applications on the other hand are usually very stateful, but 
</I>&gt;<i> precisely because they are usually confined to a single page with a 
</I>&gt;<i> single URL, you dont get the &quot;reentrance&quot; problem. You can only bookmark 
</I>&gt;<i> the initial state, which is safe.
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> If an app spans several pages with distinct URL's, but is stateful in 
</I>&gt;<i> such a way that pages are dependent on local state generated on earlier 
</I>&gt;<i> pages, it gets very fragile. We might start to see lots of &quot;You seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> be visiting this page out of context&quot; messages on Google :-)
</I>
This is already a problem, even with just cookies. I'm not sure how we can 
solve it, though.


&gt;<i> Thats not to say that the proposal is a bad idea. I see some very strong 
</I>&gt;<i> use cases for it. For example, I might have written half a page of text 
</I>&gt;<i> in a CMS, but when i hit &quot;save&quot;, I'm informed that the network 
</I>&gt;<i> connection is broken, and it wont get fixed before monday. In this case 
</I>&gt;<i> it would be very nice if the client side script could save data in a 
</I>&gt;<i> persistent local store - only accesible to this page, of course.
</I>
Exactly. This should now be possible with globalStorage[].
