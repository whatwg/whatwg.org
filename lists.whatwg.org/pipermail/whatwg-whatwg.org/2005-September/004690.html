I don't think so.  I think it stems from the average person who thinks 
about things presentationally and jumps straight from &quot;what is the 
content&quot; to &quot;how do I want it to look&quot; and then marks that up.  The 
problem is then compounded by poorly designed authoring tools that 
encourage such practices.

</I>
Yes, it does seem ludicrous when you immediately think a different style 
involves such radical changes.  However, what if you just want to be 
able to differentiate citations from emphasis, definitions, and anything 
else presented in italics by default.  For example, your stylesheet 
might say something like this:

/* default UA stylesheet */
em, cite, dfn, i { font-style: italic; }

/* Author stylesheet */
em { background-color: #EEF; }
cite { color: gray; }
dfn { font-weight: bold; }

</I>
That's another problem with WYSIWYG editors, when they attempt to imply
semantics based on how the user wan't something to look, instead of 
letting the user specify semantics and determine presentation from that.

&gt;<i> P.S. Using &lt;cite&gt; and &lt;code&gt; is relatively easy with OOo Writer/Web but

</I>
That's a limitation of the editor, and similar to the point I was trying
to make when I said above, in the part you quoted: &quot;I often have to jump
through hoops just to get &lt;code&gt; in my markup [...] by using [...] &lt;b&gt;
and/or &lt;i&gt; and then running search and replace...&quot;
