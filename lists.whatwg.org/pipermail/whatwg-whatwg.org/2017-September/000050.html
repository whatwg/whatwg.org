<PRE>Please be advised that, as promised/threatened, I have added the Trip
Summary page and you can now map and replay your trip on Google Maps.

The new version of the code is at the same link
<A HREF="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Rmd3Rn8_hDNW1zSWRoXzBTclU">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7Rmd3Rn8_hDNW1zSWRoXzBTclU</A>

Most important design/proposed-specification change is that TravelManager
subscription should now be Client specific. The TravelEvent must contain
the intended Client.id (TravelEvent.source.id). This means that the UA must
monitor and filter GeoLocation updates per client. I have also added new
demo functionality such as a Trip Summary that is displayed when you press
the &quot;Arrive&quot; button. The trip can also be replayed onto Google Maps by
pressing &quot;Map Trip&quot; or &quot;Replay&quot;. If the last and next geolocation updates
for the trip are both visible in the Map window then smooth Marker movement
is achieved via CSS transitions.

*PLEASE* help Background GeoLocation get up and help Web Apps compete with
Native Apps!

If there is something wrong with my TravelManager solution design then let
me know. Tear holes in it!

</I>&gt;<i> skills lamentable and testing skills non-existent?

</I>&gt;<i> If not, then I have no idea why Web Apps are not allowed to satisfy these

</I>&gt;<i> user-empowerment, permissions, and discovery right but let's get on with
</I>&gt;<i> it? The TravelManagerPolyfill.js file is nearly all UA developers have to
</I>&gt;<i> do!

</I>&gt;<i> Q: Have I understood the ServiceWorker architecture correctly and
