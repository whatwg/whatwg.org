</I>
How close are we to adding promises?

.add(fileEntry,callOnTransfer);

This would allow the script to write to the contents of a file entry
upon request, instead of doing it ahead of time.

callOnTransfer = function( dataTransferPromiseEvent ) {
     var dest = dataTransferPromiseEvent.fileEntry;
     /// file writer API....
     dataTransferPromiseEvent.flush();
     )
}

The fileEntry would be written ahead of time, either as a blank file,
or it'd be an already existing file.

&gt;&gt;<i> DataTransfer.addFile(fileData);
</I>&gt;<i> It's now DataTransfer.items.add(fileData);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When interacting with non-DOM apps or pages, some platforms can't easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convert arbitrary MIME types to native data transfer types for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copy/paste or DnD. For this reason, I think the spec should explicitly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list MIME types for which UAs should handle the conversion to native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data transfer types. A couple that come to mind: text/plain,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text/uri-list, text/rtf, application/rtf, text/html, text/xml,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image/png, and image/svg+xml. UAs can make a best-effort attempt to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convert the other types, but it won't be guaranteed that they will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there for interaction with non-DOM applications.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what this means exactly. Could you elaborate?
</I>
I don't think these need to be &quot;converted&quot; by a UA -- the application which
receives the data does that conversion on its own.

This list of transfer types reminds me of all the redundancy that can 
take place in a data transfer.

A sufficiently large XML content file may be transferred in ~4 different 
file formats
for compatibility with the destination.

This is a good use case for &quot;promise&quot;-based data callbacks.

</I>
This section should (and is?) be kept up with WAI-ARIA.

The concept here, of effectAllowed, is semantic, much like HTML.
If your use-case doesn't fit the minimal vocabulary, you can use your 
own cursor and other visualizations.
Even in that case, you should still include some amount of semantic data 
about the possible drop event.

</I>&gt;<i> Possibly.
</I>At this point, &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; with a remote URL is something left 
up to the operating system.

I personally like how it works, but I don't like that it's undefined in 
the standards, and left up to the OS --
it takes more steps on OS X than on Windows: in OSX you must first save 
the target to the desktop.
On windows you may enter a URL, which it then fetches into a temporary 
file directory.

Is this an area you'd like to flesh out, or leave undefined? 
&lt;intentionally left blank&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> Continuing on with tweaking URLs to work with with the File API:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Chrome has gone ahead with their setData proposal, enhancing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event.dataTransfer object so that users may drag a file from within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser onto their desktop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The extension uses setData with a key of DownloadURL and a value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including a mime type, file descriptor and URI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like this interface to work within ondrop; if getData(DownloadURL)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is set, then a FileList would be returned in event.dataTransfer.files,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much like it is when users drag files from their desktop into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would of course require Origin checks; whereas dragging onto the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> desktop does not require an Origin check.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure I follow what you are proposing. However, in a future
</I>&gt;<i> version of this API we should definitely add a &quot;promise&quot;-like feature that
</I>&gt;<i> lets you specify drag data without having it already downloaded, so that
</I>&gt;<i> when the user drops the data somewhere, the browser can then ask the JS
</I>&gt;<i> for the data. I'm not sure using setData('DownloadURL') is a good way to
</I>&gt;<i> do it; that just seems to add more hacks to an already pretty hacky API.
</I>Perhaps passing a FileEntry and/or DirectoryEntry, with function 
pointers, would work?

The file would be completely written onto the user's temporary / 
permanent filesystem when the callback is used
to signal to the browser that the file is ready to be transferred to the 
drop destination.

Constraints are already be defined by the FileSystem API, and the 
process would work with Web Workers.

</I>Set the behavior as a second &quot;File&quot;, which the drop object receives.
Existing sites should already be looping through file mime types on drop,
so this shouldn't break existing standards.

For instance, when I loop through ondrop files, I check for content type.

This is not going to help a use-case for &quot;exposing&quot; the clipboard 
contents before a drop,
as that should be handled through other routes (such as browser extensions).
It would help transfer meta-data to the scripting environment, and/or host.

Use case: An OS may store additional meta-data in file properties, such 
as a title,
or comments. When a user drags that file into a web app, they'd like 
those properties exposed.

This is something up to the individual implementer, and the environments 
they target.
Security is out of scope here, but implementers should be reminded that 
sensitive data should be exposed with great care.
