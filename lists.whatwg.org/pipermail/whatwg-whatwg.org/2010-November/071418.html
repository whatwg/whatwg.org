I don't think you can change the meaning of the dirty value flag. If it
is set to true only when the user edit the control, this code will not
work correctly anymore:
input.value = &quot;foo&quot;;
input.setAttribute('value', 'bar');
input.value will return 'bar' (instead of 'foo') because when setting
the content attribute's value, with a dirty value flag set to false, the
value is set to the content attribute's value according to the specs.

That would indeed reflect what browsers seem to do but that wouldn't be
a good idea because this UI is really bad for &lt;textarea&gt; at least. When
you type a long text, it's very frustrating to be blocked at some point
and not being able to just write what you had in mind and then reduce
the size.

We (Mozilla) are going to fix that in two steps:
1. For Firefox 4, elements will be valid if the value length is greater
than the maxlength attribute value (IOW, an element will not be able to
suffer from being too long). This is somewhat following Aryeh's suggestion.
2. After Firefox 4, we would like to introduce a new flag that will let
us know if the element's value has been changed by the user (probably if
the _last_ change has been done by the user). The meaning of this flag
would be to fix the retro-compatibility issues. Then, an element would
suffer from being too long if this flag is true and it's value length is
greater than the maxlength attribute value. In addition, users will be
able to enter text longer than the maxlength attribute for textarea (and
maybe input) elements. That way, we would be able to fix
retro-compatibility issues and provide a better experience to the users.

Feedback are welcome :)

Thanks,
