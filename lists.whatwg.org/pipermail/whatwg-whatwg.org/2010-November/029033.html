</I>
My concern is that using data: would be too easy for implementors, leading 
to some subtle yet very hard to fix bugs. :-)

For example, the origin handling for data: URLs and srcdoc=&quot;&quot; is not 
intended to be identical (though it might be currently, I haven't 
checked). Yet if we reuse data:, it's likely that implementations will 
make it identical regardless of what the spec says. There's also the 
DOCTYPE/quirks issue, where a data: document might act differently if 
opened in its own tab than if put in using srcdoc=&quot;&quot;.

The base URL was &quot;about:srcdoc&quot;. Oops. Fixed to be the base URL of the 
parent document, like about:blank. (Be careful when implementing this to 
follow the chain all the way up in the case of nested srcdoc iframes.)


&gt;<i> The referrer seems trickier. I couldn't find the about:blank referrer

</I>
When the srcdoc=&quot;&quot; is used with sandbox=&quot;&quot; set without allow-same-origin, 
the Referer header is omitted.

At other times, you are correct that it wasn't well-defined (it was 
theoretically required to be &quot;about:srcdoc&quot;). I've updated the fetching 
algorithm to make about:srcdoc documents use the parent document's URL in 
such situations (again going up the iframe chain until it hits a 
non-srcdoc document).

I considered this, but I'm not a fan of &quot;silent&quot; features like this -- I 
find that while they initially make sense, it's easy to end up in a 
situation where all the &quot;magic&quot; interacts in very confusing ways.

Also, IMHO it's easier to review &lt;iframe&gt; for security now than it would 
be if we made sandbox=&quot;&quot; silently apply sometimes: If sandbox=&quot;&quot; is 
specified, you have a sandbox, otherwise you don't. So anytime you see 
&lt;iframe&gt;, look for sandbox=&quot;&quot;.

Another use case for &lt;iframe srcdoc=&quot;&quot;&gt; is the kind of thing where today 
you have to have a blank.html file to provide the initial contents of a 
frame that you'll be populating with other pages (e.g. help contents in a 
help viewer). With srcdoc=&quot;&quot; you can now conveniently put the original 
document in the same file as the &lt;iframe&gt;:

   &lt;iframe seamless srcdoc=&quot;&lt;p&gt;Select a topic from the list.&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

It's very convenient because you can then use either a script setting 
src=&quot;&quot; directly or regular &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt; to update the iframe. The 
latter is useful if you want the back/forward button to work, the former 
is best if you want to handle that yourself or if you ever want to be able 
to go back to the default (just remove the 'src' attribute and it'll flip 
back to the default).

There's nothing special about text/html-sandboxed here -- anything whose 
URL is from the same origin is allowed to be seamless, even if it is 
sandboxed with sandbox=&quot;&quot;.

That's not quite what that means, technically. The about: spec basically 
says that the above results in about:srcdoc doing the same as 
about:foobar, where &quot;foobar&quot; is some value the UA made up but didn't 
publicly define (e.g. about:mozilla, about:config, about:cache...).


&gt;<i> In working on the WebKit implementation I've found that this requirement

I don't quite follow what you mean.


&gt;<i> So, I propose making about:srcdoc resolvable when the srcdoc attribute

I don't know what you mean.

I don't understand. Do you mean that if the user clicks on a link like &lt;a 
href=&quot;about:srcdoc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; inside an &lt;iframe srcdoc='like &lt;a   
href=&quot;about:srcdoc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;'&gt;, the page should reload? That seems weird. 
Why would we do that?

If you mean just that location.reload() should work in a srcdoc iframe, 
then that's a different matter... I agree that that would make sense. I've 
updated the spec accordingly.
