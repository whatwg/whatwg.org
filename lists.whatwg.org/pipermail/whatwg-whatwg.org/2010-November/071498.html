I'm not laughing: using the 'Help' menu in old Windows (what was that, 
98?) to into explorer.exe was one of my favorite security holes. I don't 
think it's unreasonable to expect that spell checkers would be 
distributed within the browser. But I don't want to add on additional 
burdens to UA designers either. I don't think it's reasonable to play 
for system spell checkers to be exploited; if it's being tossed to the 
OS, then it really is an OS responsibility. If there is an exploit via a 
buffer overflow on a string/unicode pattern, it's quite possible that an 
existing spell checker would fail within the existing scheme.

Regarding while(1) alert(&quot;boo&quot;) -- I really like how the &quot;Ignore further 
notifications from this page&quot; option evolved to solve that issue. Spell 
checkers have something similar that people are used to: &quot;Ignore all&quot;.

With the system dialog: Isn't the point here, to maintain consistency 
with the OS? Using an OS-level spell check dialog would do that.

It's not my favorite solution, but I'd like to find some way to inch 
forward (giving up on taking full steps).
