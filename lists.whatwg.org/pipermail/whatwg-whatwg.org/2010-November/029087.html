</I>I've heard this before, and I'm afraid that it's a stuck-issue I'll 
never unstick.
Canvas is a low level API, SVG is a serialized format of a scene graph. 
They're not the same thing.

You may implement an SVG rendering engine in Canvas, you may use some 
other scene graph.

I've been through this discussion with several people, and I really do 
lack the perspective to
understand the hang-up on &quot;SVG&quot; vs Canvas. One is a rendering API, one 
is a serialized file format.
They're two different classes.
&gt;<i> That said, this seems like a general quality-of-implementation issue,
</I>&gt;<i> right?  Expecting the page to rerender the entire canvas on any zoom
</I>&gt;<i> operation doesn't seem reasonable....  A UA could handle this by
</I>&gt;<i> supersampling the canvas, for example (and in the past we've considered
</I>&gt;<i> doing that for Firefox, actually).
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>While Apple has certainly worked in supersampling, it's completely 
unnecessary.
I don't see why expecting a page to re-render is unreasonable. That's 
exactly what pages do
right now. In most implementations, Canvas is tied to the same 
rasterization engine as HTML.

I've demonstrated a rich application with zooming quality equivalent to 
the HTML rendering.
There's a reason why they are equivalent: they're using the same logic, 
they're using the same
raster libraries. They are in a very physical sense, the same.

Stated succinctly: It is entirely reasonable to re-render canvas when an 
&quot;onresize&quot; event is received,
it's a standard practice. There's no reason for the UA to handle it any 
differently than it does now
(scaling the CSS pixels). This is something to be left up to the 
implementer.

&gt;&gt;<i> Boris, Rob: As an accessibility use case, this is quite important.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it's reasonable to demand resolution independence from

</I>&gt;<i> for them; using them instead seems more appropriate than grafting
</I>&gt;<i> poor-man's resolution independence onto canvas.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>PNG is a bitmap format. Canvas is a drawing API. It's not poor-man's 
resolution independence:
it's a reasonable, standards based implementation. It exists now, it 
works fine, and I am notably
frustrated by your responses. They are not grounded in an appreciation 
for my use cases nor
the evidence I have to provide.

When I say: please expose additional screen metrics, you respond: You're 
doing it wrong,
it's poor, and we tried to do it for you, but it didn't work out.

I mean.. come on.

My evidence is essentially nullified when you make broad statements 
about how there are
better tools and better formats. I don't doubt your good intentions 
here, but I am suggesting
that you've made an error in judgement.
