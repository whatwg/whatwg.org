I've added a simple version of this (no Blob support, and no way to add a 
dataTransferItem, but otherwise more or less the same).

Yes.

getData() doesn't expose the items with files, only those that are text. 
(It can't expose the files since those are asynchronous binary Blobs, not 
synchronous Unicode strings).


&gt;<i> How come there's no DataTransferItems.get(type) method?
</I>
It would probably have to be get(type, kind) and would have to be able to 
return a list, at which point you might as well just iterate over the 
actual .items list and check the type and kind for each one directly. It 
seems that a get() here wouldn't really save much. If you have any use 
cases you could show, I'd be happy to see what the code would look like 
though to see if it would save much. If it does, certainly it would make 
sense to add something like that.

I don't follow. Could you give an example of what you mean?

Yeah, I ended up going that way.

Currently the new DataTransferItems API doesn't enforce the limit of one 
&quot;string&quot; item per type. Should it?

I'm happy to add a mapping list if someone can provide one for common 
platforms. I don't currently have one. The spec just says that the UA 
should do a best effort attempt.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DataTransfer mirrors DataTransferItems, but DataTransfer.getData() will

Currently the types of files and of string data are different namespaces, 
you can have a text/plain file and a text/plain string. Should I disallow 
this? Is it not possible to end up in such a situation in native DND UIs?


&gt;<i> Maybe a second getData method that can provide conversion given a text 
</I>&gt;<i> encoding would be useful?
</I>
the File/Blob API should support that, I don't think we should add 
something like this specifically for drag-and-drop.


&gt;<i> DataTransfer.addFile(fileData);
</I>
It's now DataTransfer.items.add(fileData);


&gt;<i> When interacting with non-DOM apps or pages, some platforms can't easily

</I>&gt;<i> text/uri-list, text/rtf, application/rtf, text/html, text/xml, 
</I>&gt;<i> image/png, and image/svg+xml. UAs can make a best-effort attempt to 
</I>&gt;<i> convert the other types, but it won't be guaranteed that they will be 
</I>&gt;<i> there for interaction with non-DOM applications.
</I>
I'm not sure what this means exactly. Could you elaborate?

The new DataTransferItems feature could let you do this using 
dataTransfer.items.add(blob), if we added that. Right now you can add just 
text strings and File objects. We could also one day support arbitrary JS 
objects (with the structured clone stuff) the same way, too.

Yes.

I've added a dropzone=&quot;&quot; attribute that lets you do this easily.

You can give the images different types in the dragstart event. Other 
thant that, you can't inspect the data during the dragenter/dragover 
events, because that would be a security risk (think of what happens if 
you drag a confidential file over a hostile web page to drop it on the 
other side of your browser).

You don't have to use dataTransfer, but there's no harm in using it as far 
as I can tell, especially with the expanded API that works with 
dropzone=&quot;&quot; to let you control where you can drop something.


&gt;<i> * Regardless if the D&amp;D spec example is changed (or another one added

Done.

Yes, but it's about 10 years too late to change that.

</I>
It's almost certainly the case that these libraries are more powerful than 
the API in HTML. Standardisation always follows innovation. If there are 
specific features that are used a lot, we should adopt them. Are there?

</I>
I'm not quite sure I follow what you are proposing. However, in a future 
version of this API we should definitely add a &quot;promise&quot;-like feature that 
lets you specify drag data without having it already downloaded, so that 
when the user drops the data somewhere, the browser can then ask the JS 
for the data. I'm not sure using setData('DownloadURL') is a good way to 
do it; that just seems to add more hacks to an already pretty hacky API.

I'm not exactly sure what we should do here. A whitelist seems like the 
only solution, since a blacklist is just asking for trouble. However, a 
whitelist dramatically reduces the options in terms of what can be done 
with a Web app -- for example, the list above doesn't include dragging a 
vCard to or from an address book app.

Also, what types should we support going out vs going in?

I've added a comment in the spec source to the effect that this needs 
specifying, but I don't really know what it should say.
