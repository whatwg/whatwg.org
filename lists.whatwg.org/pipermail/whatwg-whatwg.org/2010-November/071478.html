I did not say that &lt;html:input type=password&gt; was the source of
password data that was learned by the spell checker.

I said that a spell checker could learn passwords. In fact on the
platforms I use, spell checkers are system global (e.g. OS X), not
browser local.

&gt;<i> As

</I>&gt;<i> something else would it?!
</I>
Input Methods are also system global. On mobile platforms you often
have a Terminal application which doesn't hint to the IME when a
remote session is masking passwords. Thus the IME has no way of
knowing that what you're typing is a password.

Have you ever tried to write a shell which was fully aware of what a
(potentially localized) password prompt looked like? It's pretty much
impossible. When presented with complaints that &quot;dictionaries are
learning passwords&quot;, UI designers take the &quot;oh no!, let's turn off the
dictionary for app A!&quot; approach, this doesn't help app B nor does it
help the user (where most of the learned &quot;words&quot; are in fact used
frequently and worth not having to type out).

On old mobile platforms the closest things to a spell checker is the
completion dictionary (new &quot;words&quot; are managed automatically by the
IME). - This includes Maemo 5 which was released in 2009, not a long
time ago.

Given past behaviors of IME/dictionaries, I think it isn't
unreasonable to expect similar behavior in future dictionaries on
future platforms.
