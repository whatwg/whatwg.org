&gt;<i> I've only asked that information be made available. The response from your group seems to be &quot;you can't handle the truth!&quot;
</I>
As a non-UA developer spectating since the beginning of this thread, my take 
on what you're asking for is it would be something destined to be misused to 
possibly the same widespread degree that happened when web stylists 
discovered that the CSS spec writers had given them the irrelevantly relative 
px unit. Before CSS, web designers were unable to make text more than two 
sizes smaller than the web user's default, which when they went that far, 
which was more often than not, left contextual sizing all but non-existent. 
With CSS, authors could not only make text even smaller, but could completely 
disregard user defaults, eliminating all relativity between defaults and 
results. I see what you're asking for as yet another back door to turning a 
user agent into an author agent, giving authors even more undeserved power to 
vex users, and think those responding to you feel similarly.
