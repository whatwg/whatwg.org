It cannot, and should not. It's a user concern. If as a user I want all 
data that you send me to be printed unencrypted and dropped out of my 
office window for anyone to read, then I should be allowed to do that. :-)

</I>
Secure from what?

That is generally the best way forward for any feature, indeed.

</I>
It's probably the most wide-spread attack in the real world.


&gt;<i> There are several attacks that are much cheaper and easier which 
</I>&gt;<i> encryption of data on disk can prevent. I think one of the biggest risks 
</I>&gt;<i> is simply the discarded hard drives. While most places which deal in 
</I>&gt;<i> sensitive data require that hard drives are erased or destroyed before 
</I>&gt;<i> being disposed of, in practice, that's something that's very easy to 
</I>&gt;<i> overlook when discarding an old computer. There is considerable risk of 
</I>&gt;<i> someone just doing dumpster diving being able to recover sensitive data, 
</I>&gt;<i> which can be prevented (with no risk of the password being sniffed) by 
</I>&gt;<i> just encrypting all potentially sensitive data before writing it to the 
</I>&gt;<i> disk.
</I>
In practice, people having their data read from their discarded disks is 
far less of a problem than people getting malware installed on their 
active systems.

Also, unless the data is encrypted behind a password prompt and the 
password is very secure, encryption isn't particularly helpful. I think 
it's optimistic to hope that browsers will ask all users to enter a secure 
passphrase before being able to use local storage.


&gt;<i> The stolen laptop attack is similar; encryption will prevent sensitive 
</I>&gt;<i> data from being leaked, and stealing a laptop is a lot easier than 
</I>&gt;<i> stealing a laptop, installing a keylogger, returning it unnoticed, and 
</I>&gt;<i> then collecting the data from the keylogger unnoticed.
</I>
Stolen (or lost) laptops are a common problem (though nothing on the scale 
of malware/keylogger attacks), but that problem is solved by disk-wide 
encryption with a secure system-wide passphrase, not by a password for 
local storage. The former, assuming the laptop is stolen while turned off 
rather than suspended, is a pretty good defence. The latter is almost 
certainly a worthless defence since the data or key are likely to be found 
elsewhere in the system (e.g. in the pagefile).


&gt;<i> So, there are real security benefits to ensuring that sensitive data is 
</I>&gt;<i> stored encrypted. One way to do this is to require the platform to 
</I>&gt;<i> encrypt the data, either the browser itself or the browser ensuring that 
</I>&gt;<i> the operating system has some sort of full-disk encryption. The web app 
</I>&gt;<i> could then require the browser report that data will be encrypted before 
</I>&gt;<i> sending the data down. The problem with this is that browsers may lie, 
</I>&gt;<i> or be mistaken about full-disk encryption. Microsoft Exchange has a flag 
</I>&gt;<i> that notifies the server whether data is stored encrypted, and some 
</I>&gt;<i> companies have policies of not allowing clients that don't support 
</I>&gt;<i> encryption. Of course, this means that several clients just lie, 
</I>&gt;<i> claiming to encrypt the data while not actually doing so (I believe the 
</I>&gt;<i> initial version of the iPhone Exchange client did this, though my memory 
</I>&gt;<i> may be hazy).
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> Anyhow, I think most of the reasonable ideas have been suggested in this 
</I>&gt;<i> thread (allow the browser to report whether data will be stored 
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted, provide a JS crypto API to allow web apps to more easily 
</I>&gt;<i> encrypt and decrypt data piecemeal on the client side). The one thing 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd add is that if you really want to make sure that private data will 
</I>&gt;<i> be encrypted, it's probably best not to allow users to have access to 
</I>&gt;<i> that data unless they are known (by some out of band means, such as IT 
</I>&gt;<i> department policy and limiting access to the data to certain machines) 
</I>&gt;<i> to be on managed machines that have full-disk encryption, or that they 
</I>&gt;<i> have read and agreed to a policy that states that they must use 
</I>&gt;<i> full-disk encryption. This way, it's the user or the IT department's 
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to ensure that the disk is encrypted securely, not the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser vendor which may or may not know.
</I>
This seems somewhat out of scope of a Web technology specification.
