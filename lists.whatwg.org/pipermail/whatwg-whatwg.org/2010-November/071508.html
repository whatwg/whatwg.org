No, as far as I know, Opera hasn't ever sandboxed any inline javascript:  
URL execution. That's one reason why it's easier to just not run them at  
all.

&gt;<i> Also, note that &lt;embed src=&quot;javascript:&quot;&gt; and &lt;applet  
</I>&gt;<i> something=&quot;javascript:&quot;&gt; (can't recall the attr name right now) also  
</I>&gt;<i> execute the script in Firefox.  Do they in Opera?
</I>
Neither of these execute in Opera, both were explicitly blocked before I  
started looking into the issue. Note that I can't get &lt;applet  
something=&quot;javascript:&quot;&gt; to execute in Firefox either, perhaps it needs a  
special value for &quot;something&quot; or the Java plugin must be installed?

Thanks for that pointer. For those who don't want to dig, it was about  
generating a SVG document for &lt;object data=&quot;&quot;&gt;. The demo  
&lt;<A HREF="https://bug300263.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=188843">https://bug300263.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=188843</A>&gt; will  
break if you start sandboxing the execution as per spec, as it refers to  
eg_svg from the outer environment. It also doesn't currently work in  
Opera, it seems like we just execute &lt;object data=&quot;javascript:&quot;&gt;, but  
don't use the return value as the document. Since it also won't work in IE  
or WebKit, it seems unlikely that there's much content depending on this.

It seems to me that after sandboxing, javascript: URLs will be quite  
useless. You can only use them where the content is text, and the script  
has to be completely self-confined. Using data: URLs will allow you to  
generate the data in the outer environment, and it's possible to generate  
binary data.

For reference here's the same demo done with a data: URL instead:  
<A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/721">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/721</A> Unlike the  
javascript: version, this actually works in Opera, Firefox and presumably  
all browsers that support SVG in &lt;object&gt; and data: URLs.

So far, it seems that the fastest way to reach compat between browsers is  
to simply not run inline javascript: URLs.
