I did eventually add required=&quot;&quot;, so this is not moot, hopefully.

</I>&gt;<i> That seems to say that setting via .value will set the dirty flag

Hm, yes, you are correct.

I've lost track of the context for this; does the above imply that there 
is a change we need to make?

Your optimism about Web authors is higher than mine. :-)


&gt;<i> In addition, &lt;output&gt; is already semantically linked to some elements so 
</I>&gt;<i> marking it invalid should be a hint that they need to be modified.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the UI point of view, you can easily found use cases when showing 
</I>&gt;<i> the output is much more convenient that highlighting all elements making 
</I>&gt;<i> the output invalid. For example, in a web application to select courses 
</I>&gt;<i> in a university. If there is an output showing the sum of credits which 
</I>&gt;<i> has to be between 12 and 18, it sounds to be nicer to have the output 
</I>&gt;<i> marked as invalid with a message explaining that the sum of credits has 
</I>&gt;<i> to be between 12 and 18 than having all courses marked as invalid which 
</I>&gt;<i> can be wrongly interpreted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though, I don't think the UI is a valid point here. Shouldn't we let the 
</I>&gt;<i> authors choose what UI they want to implement and just give them the API 
</I>&gt;<i> to do it?
</I>
Well the setCustomValidity() API is just to set the UI; if they want to do 
their own UI then they can just do that without using the method at all.
