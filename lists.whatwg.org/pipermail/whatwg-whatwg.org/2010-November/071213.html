Currently, this seems to be implemented by the OS:
Vista downloads a URL to the temporary files directory, then passes it 
to the browser.
No cookies, or other credentials are sent with the fetch, as it is an 
OS-level fetch.

Entering a remote URL does not seem to function in OS X as there is no 
place on the file upload screen to enter a URL.

Is this something we want to leave undefined? As the &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; 
widget typically
routes directly to OS-level file management, I don't think there's a 
simple solution to bringing
more control to the browser.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> for the data. I'm not sure using setData('DownloadURL') is a good way to
</I>&gt;<i> do it; that just seems to add more hacks to an already pretty hacky API.
</I>The DataTransferItem proposal is heading in this direction.
Currently, a file collection &quot;.files&quot;, works with the File API and 
XmlHttpRequest.
Drag+drop from the desktop returns file objects.

I'm proposing we explore methods to enable drag+drop from within the 
browser to return file objects.

The FileSystem API is a resource: we can now build a file from within 
standard APIs.
Until that point, we could only use the BlobBuilder semantics.

The proposal DataTransferItem.add(fileData)
pretty much takes care of the request (when used with a working/complete 
FileSystem API).

We still need a promise-like feature, as you've pointed out.

....

On a side note -- I've been having a lot of issue with building blobs:

Are there currently semantics in place to distinguish a DOMString from 
binary data?

At present, I can only think of Typed Arrays from the WebGL-related specs.

Currently, when I try to build a Blob using binary data, I end up with a 
UTF-8 escaped DOM String.

I'm still forced to run an XHR request, to grab binary data for an image 
(one already loaded by the browser),
so that I can store that image data in local storage. I then use a 
js-based base64 encoder, as browser encoders are expecting
a DOMString and throw errors on binary (per specs).

This would be solved in part, via FileSystem/File APIs, but they're also 
expecting DOMString.
I expect it's meant to be solved by adding Blob support directly to XHR.
