from my unfortunate experience in this area, timers cost extra. (even
above wifi cost.)

that's better :)

&gt;<i> How can the &quot;file picker posting system&quot; know something like actual

</I>&gt;<i> to know the actual sending time after he starts moving and the
</I>&gt;<i> connection drops to 3G mobile network (around 0.5mbps) or GPRS or GSM
</I>&gt;<i> data mobile network (around 0.001mbps).
</I>
i think we're supposed to send offline notifications, i'd assume that
network changes would trigger that.

whether they do or don't, your ip address will change (unless you have
a really magical vpn), and as such your connection will fail. without
some magical resume features (perhaps as i described below), you'll
have to start over. so no problem here.

&gt;<i> I cannot imagine anything but a
</I>&gt;<i> progress bar displaying the current rate (or transfer rate for the
</I>&gt;<i> previous 30 seconds if that's how often the progress can be updated
</I>&gt;<i> because the battery must be conserved).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lists a fileSize property. I think it'd be nice if gmail could tell me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that &quot;this file will take an hour to upload&quot;. I also wonder if it'd be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a good idea to support getting chunks of a file, because if I had a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4gb file, using DOMFile().getAsBinary() would probably crash my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser. I'd kinda like for gmail to be able to do partial uploads....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order for this to work, there should be DOMString hash() which has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an optional argument for a hash algorithm (&quot;md5sum&quot;, a const for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; md5sum, or maybe an object { processBlock:function(data) {},
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getHash:function() }. Otherwise a user could try feeding sequential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blocks from different files.
</I>
&gt;<i> I agree that something like that would be nice to have for some cases.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do not think that such behavior would make upload progress
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring unneeded.
</I>
&gt;<i> The current &quot;fix&quot; for this problem is to connect
</I>&gt;<i> the receiving server with HttpXmlRequest() and ask the server how much
</I>&gt;<i> data the server has received. Then this result can be displayed somehow
</I>&gt;<i> to the user.
</I>
implementation demos are probably a good thing before discussing a standard :)

&gt;<i> I don't think that IE has a working upload progress meter. I have always
</I>&gt;<i> experienced IE just to simply slowly increase the progress meter until
</I>&gt;<i> the page is done; it's advancing even if I disconnect the network cable
</I>&gt;<i> during the progress... (just tried IE6 and IE7)
</I>
interesting (clever even)

&gt;<i> If it will probably be added in the future anyway shouldn't the spec
</I>&gt;<i> recommend doing so sooner?
</I>
spec after implementation experience, not before. preferably including
experience with mobile devices.

&gt;<i> I'm not saying that every UA MUST do so but
</I>&gt;<i> they should (unless they have a good reason not to).
