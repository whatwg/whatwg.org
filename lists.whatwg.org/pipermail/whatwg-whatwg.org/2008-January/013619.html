Fixed, in theory. But since I have no idea what I'm talking about here, 
you'll have to check closely to make sure I didn't babble incoherently.

Wouldn't that mean that different browsers could have different effects 
when rendering external images -- with gamma -- to the canvas?


&gt;<i> &quot;The putImageData(image, dx, dy) method must take the given ImageData

</I>&gt;<i> the pixels in that area rather than doing anything like normal drawing,

Is it better now?


&gt;<i> &quot;an integer array&quot; - what is that? Does { 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, length:4 }
