</I>
Perhaps the accesskey should be kept but its meaning should be
transformed a bit. Instead of being a key (letter) it should be a
keyword for a behavior. A good accesskey values could be &quot;home&quot;,
&quot;index&quot;, &quot;search&quot;, &quot;contact&quot;. The user then could bind the &quot;home&quot;
accesskey to any &quot;home&quot; button of his selection. It could be CTRL+H or
perhaps F11 instead. Some keyboards have additional &quot;multimedia&quot; keys
that could easily be used for such behavior.

The spec could describe that for backwards compatibility UAs should
expect to find keywords such as &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, ... and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; etc. and
that those keywords should be considered to be static for the site but
have no specific meaning otherwise. A mobile device could map keyword
&quot;1&quot; to button &quot;1&quot; by default if it seems to make sense.

So my suggestion is to turn the &quot;accesskey&quot; to a tag of the behavior or
feature linked to the element. One could argue that instead the &quot;rel&quot;
attribute should be used for such behavior and I really cannot claim
otherwise...
