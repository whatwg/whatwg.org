The problem does indeed have a god solution, which is to remove the stupid  
suggestion about the activation behaviour (alt/cmd/etc) in the spec. iCab,  
Opera, Amaya and Firefox have already implemented something intelligent  
that lets you avoid conflicts.

&gt;<i> The specification could include an explicit statement of the form &quot;UAs
</I>&gt;<i> must ignore the accesskey= attribute&quot;, but any such statement would be
</I>&gt;<i> in the yet-to-be-written &quot;Rendering&quot; section.
</I>
And an unimaginatve and unintelligent approach anyway.

&gt;&gt;<i> ...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the equivalent of arrow keys plus an enter key/mouse button.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the context of delivering content to those devices, it's useful

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since most pages that contain links don't also use accesskey=, handset

</I>
They do. However, accesskey, which is to primarily designed to give an  
increased navigation priority to certain links, is very useful for  
handsets, and not actually very complicated to implement, in a way that is  
consistent with the existing markup. It might not be the same across all  
implementations, but there is very little restriction needed to make an  
implementation compatible with almost any imaginable UI.

And all of this has been proposed before, implemented by people in various  
ways in javascript or via proxy-based scripting as well as in user agents,  
and is hardly rocket science.

you a set of implementation techniques, links to a set of minimal changes  
required to the spec, etc. (There is more that could be done in an  
advanced implementation, but it isn't really complicated).
