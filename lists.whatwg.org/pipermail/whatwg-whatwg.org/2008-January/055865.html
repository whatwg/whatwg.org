Very little, actually.


&gt;<i> Are there plans to merge the groups?
</I>
Not especially. There are people who for a number of reasons are unable to 
join the W3C group, and there are others who are unable to join the WHATWG 
group. As editor in both groups I take all input into account anyway -- 
and there are far more places where input on HTML5 is sent than just these 
two mailing lists (e.g. blogs, <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">www-html at w3.org</A>, forums, direct mail, 
meetings, etc).


&gt;<i> Which group has authority in the event of a dispute or is that unknown?
</I>
I don't really understand what kind of dispute would happen. I take 
feedback from everyone when editing the spec, and there is only one actual 
spec that I edit. I don't look at where the feedback is coming from when 
dealing with technical arguments.


&gt;<i> My spider-senses tell me we're going to end up with 2 HTML5's.
</I>
Well, I'm editing both specs, and I can guarentee that as long as I edit 
both, that they will either remain identical, or that the WHATWG one will 
be a superset of the W3C one. In practice this hasn't been a problem so 
far. (In practice, also, even if we did somehow merge the two groups, if 
the resulting group started doing ridiculous stuff without responding to 
feedback, then a new group would likely end up being formed to take up the 
job. That's pretty much how all the WHATWG started back in 2004.)
