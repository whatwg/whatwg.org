<PRE>Jerason Banes &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">jbanes at gmail.com</A>&gt;, 2008-01-25 23:41 -0600:

&gt;<i> Long story short, accesskeys were an idea that worked better on paper than
</I>&gt;<i> they did in practice. They inevitably interfered with normal browser
</I>&gt;<i> operation as well as other accessibility features in such a way as to *
</I>&gt;<i> reduce* the accessibility of many web pages.
</I>
Another long story short: accesskey mark is already in use in a
significant amount of existing content, so leaving it unspec'ed
for implementors does not seem like a practical option -- not if
we care about trying to ensure that behavior of that content is
consistent/ interoperable across UAs.

To elaborate a bit: A class of content in which accesskey markup
is in particularly wide and effective use (effective as far as its
content providers and users of it are concerned) is content
intended for viewing, as one of its possible delivery contexts, on
mobile handsets.

Most handsets don't have keyboards or real pointing devices that
let you quickly point and click on links; instead they just have
numeric keypads and &quot;5-way&quot; directional pads that are basically
the equivalent of arrow keys plus an enter key/mouse button.

In the context of delivering content to those devices, it's useful
to provide numbered access keys for quick access to certain links
on a page -- to save users the time and trouble of needing to use
the 5-way on the handset to scroll to the links and activate them.

And that's why there's a large body of existing content that has
accesskey markup: sites that takes browsing from mobile handsets
into consideration as one of their possible delivery contexts.
