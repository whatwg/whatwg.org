Indeed, it is an unfortunate situation. There are people at the political 
and financial levels working to address the situation to everyone's 
satisfaction, but obviously such work is by its very nature not 
transparent, and I am not able to uphold the usually high level of 
transparency afforded to the rest of HTML5 with this issue.


&gt;<i> Which brings us to the hard questions at the crux of the matter:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) When a browser vendor acts clearly outside of the public interest in 
</I>&gt;<i> the making of a public standard should that vendors desires still be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered relevant to the specification?
</I>
Their technical arguments, where valid, should be considered, as should 
all technical arguments, yes. Of course, if someone or a some group is 
acting in bad faith, then their credibility is reduced and their 
non-technical input is likely to be ignored more. In the WHATWG I do not 
believe we have seen any browser vendors act in bad faith; indeed on this 
issue in particular all the browser vendors have been quite forthcoming 
(though, unfortunately, not very compromising).


&gt;<i> 2.) When an issue is divided between a vendor (or group of) and 'the 
</I>&gt;<i> public' (or part of), what relative weight can be assigned to each?
</I>
The needs of the end users are paramount. Unfortunately, since the browser 
vendors have the final say (in a very pragmatic sense, since they 
ultimately decide what their browsers implement), the needs of the end 
users can often only be met by satisfying the needs of the browser vendors 
as well.


&gt;<i> 3.) When a vendor makes false or misleading statements to guide an 
</I>&gt;<i> outcome should there be a form of 'censure' that does not involve a 
</I>&gt;<i> public flame war?
</I>
The reaction to someone or some group acting in bad faith have to be 
catered on a case-by-case basis. In one case I have banned someone from 
the list for a couple of weeks; in other cases issues have been resolved 
simply by open debate. I work closely with the browser vendors in the 
WHATWG to ensure that they do not consider dishonesty a useful policy.


&gt;<i> 4.) If the purpose of the group is to build interoperability should a 
</I>&gt;<i> vendor be 'censured' for holding interoperability to ransom without 
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient technical or legal grounds?
</I>&gt;<i> 5.) What methods exists to define a disruptive member and remove them 
</I>&gt;<i> from further consideration?
