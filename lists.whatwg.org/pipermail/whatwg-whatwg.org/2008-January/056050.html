</I>I'm not sure exactly what you want the spec to say here (perhaps because 
I'm no clear what a &quot;media runtime&quot; is - is a codec a media runtime? Is 
Flash? Is a Java applet? Is the mplayer plugin?).

Since browsers are free to implement native &lt;video&gt; support with a 
pluggable backend (which, indeed,  WebKit is doing by leveraging 
Quicktime and which Opera and Mozilla could in principle do by using 
e.g. gStreamer), registering different codecs to provide first-class 
video clients is already possible. A good implementation would prompt 
for codec download when no suitable installed codecs were found.

However I get the impression that this is not what you are after. Are 
you looking for a way for plugins, rather than the browser itself, to 
handle &lt;video&gt;? If so, why? It seems to me that plugins are limited in 
scope and provide a poor user experience compared to native support and 
it's not clear what advantages they would have.
