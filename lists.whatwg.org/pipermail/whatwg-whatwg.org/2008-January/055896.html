I don't know much about colour spaces either, so someone else should
check that it's sane :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; maybe it's safest to just say that all colours throughout the canvas API

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exactly which it is).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
I guess so; and things like gradients wouldn't work consistently if
the colour space wasn't consistent.

Maybe the desired properties are:
- drawImage(&lt;img&gt;) onto a displayed &lt;canvas&gt; should look the same as
the original &lt;img&gt;, regardless of whether the image has gamma etc.
- toDataURL should return the same raw pixel data as getImageData, at
least for image/png (though other formats might make that impossible),
for consistency.
- drawImage(toDataURL()) should have no effect.

I'd also like:
- fillStyle = 'rgb(r, g, b)'; fillRect(...); getImageData returns
exactly [r, g, b, 255].
mainly because that makes it possible to write test cases that use
getImageData to check the results.

I don't know if any of these are wrong, or if others are missing. And
I have no idea if this is trivial for implementors, or if it's
impossible. So I don't have any useful suggestions.

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;The putImageData(image, dx, dy) method must take the given ImageData
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure, and draw it at the specified location dx,dy in the canvas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coordinate space, mapping each pixel represented by the ImageData
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure into one device pixel.&quot; - how should it 'draw it'? Given the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirement on putImageData(getImageData(...)), it has to be replacing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the pixels in that area rather than doing anything like normal drawing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that isn't explicit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it better now?
</I>
It looks clear enough to me.

&gt;<i> &gt; In the example code:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;function FillCload(data, x, y) { ... }&quot; - should be &quot;function
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FillCloud(data, x, y) { ... }&quot;.
</I>
That error was replaced with &quot;function AddCload(data, x, y) { ... }&quot; - s/a/u/

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;The width and height (w and h) might be different than the sw and sh
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arguments to the function&quot; - 'different than' sounds a bit odd to me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here; maybe I'd prefer 'different from'.
</I>
Oops, I was wrong to mention that - 'different than' seems to be
common in some Englishes, and I don't want to complain when it's just
dialect variations.
