Fixed, in theory. But since I have no idea what I'm talking about here, 
you'll have to check closely to make sure I didn't babble incoherently.


&gt;<i> maybe it's safest to just say that all colours throughout the canvas API 
</I>&gt;<i> must be handled consistently in the same colour space (without saying 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly which it is).
</I>
Wouldn't that mean that different browsers could have different effects 
when rendering external images -- with gamma -- to the canvas?


&gt;<i> &quot;The putImageData(image, dx, dy) method must take the given ImageData 
</I>&gt;<i> structure, and draw it at the specified location dx,dy in the canvas 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate space, mapping each pixel represented by the ImageData 
</I>&gt;<i> structure into one device pixel.&quot; - how should it 'draw it'? Given the 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement on putImageData(getImageData(...)), it has to be replacing 
</I>&gt;<i> the pixels in that area rather than doing anything like normal drawing, 
</I>&gt;<i> but that isn't explicit.
</I>
Is it better now?


&gt;<i> &quot;an integer array&quot; - what is that? Does { 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, length:4 } 
</I>&gt;<i> count, since it looks quite like an array? Why can't I use a non-integer 
</I>&gt;<i> array like [ 255*(0.5 + 0.5*Math.sin(x/100)) for (x in [0, 1, 2, 3, ... 
</I>&gt;<i> ]) ] and have putImageData round to integers, and clamp to the range [0, 
</I>&gt;<i> 255], since that would be closer to what I wanted than an exception 
</I>&gt;<i> would be?
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> Given the quite disgusting code like &quot;[i for (i in function (n) { for 
</I>&gt;<i> (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i += 1) yield 0 }(w*h*4)) ]&quot; to generate an array of 
</I>&gt;<i> zeros, maybe it would be nice to accepted 'undefined' element values and 
</I>&gt;<i> treat them as zero, so that people don't have to bother filling in parts 
</I>&gt;<i> of the array they don't care about.
</I>
Ok.


&gt;<i> (For Firefox 2 / Minefield, it throws NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR if .data 
</I>&gt;<i> is not an actual JS array, or if .data.length &lt; w*h*4. For each of the 
</I>&gt;<i> first w*h*4 elements, if it is not a number then it throws 
</I>&gt;<i> NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR. Otherwise it gets rounded towards zero: if the 
</I>&gt;<i> result is an integer in the range [-2^30, 2^30), or if you're running on 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows instead of Linux (?!), then it gets wrapped to the range [0, 
</I>&gt;<i> 256), else it gets treated as 0. Elements after the first w*h*4 are 
</I>&gt;<i> completely ignored. See 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/imagedata.html">http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/imagedata.html</A>&gt;, but not in 
</I>&gt;<i> FF2-on-Linux because that's totally broken.)
</I>
The spec doesn't quite require that now, but it should be better defined 
than it was, at least.


&gt;<i> In the example code:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;var could&quot; - should be &quot;var cloud&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;function FillPlasma(data) { ... }&quot; - should be &quot;function
</I>&gt;<i> FillPlasma(data, color) { ... }&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;function FillCload(data, x, y) { ... }&quot; - should be &quot;function
</I>&gt;<i> FillCloud(data, x, y) { ... }&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The example creates two ImageDatas of the same size, the putImageDatas 
</I>&gt;<i> one on top of the other at the same position. That seems pointless, 
</I>&gt;<i> since the second will completely overwrite the first.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;The current transformation matrix must not affect the getImageData() 
</I>&gt;<i> and putImageData() methods.&quot; - nor must the composite operation, global 
</I>&gt;<i> alpha, shadow, clip region ( ? In FF it does get clipped), ...
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;the rectangle which has one corner at the (sx, sy) coordinate&quot; - 
</I>&gt;<i> s/one/its top left/
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;Each component of each device pixel represented in this array must be 
</I>&gt;<i> in the range 0..255&quot; vs &quot;The ImageData object's data array only contains 
</I>&gt;<i> entries that are in the range 0 to 255 inclusive&quot; - inconsistent way of 
</I>&gt;<i> referring to ranges.
</I>
One of these seems to have gone.


&gt;<i> &quot;the specified location dx,dy in the canvas coordinate space&quot; - should 
</I>&gt;<i> be &quot;(dx, dy)&quot; for consistent notation.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;ImageData objects must be initialised so that their height attribute is 
</I>&gt;<i> set to h, [...] their width attribute is set to w, [...] and the data 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute is initialised to an array of h&#215;w&#215;4 integers.&quot; - height/h are 
</I>&gt;<i> written before width/w here, whereas everywhere else in the document has 
</I>&gt;<i> widths before heights.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;The width and height (w and h) might be different than the sw and sh 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments to the function&quot; - 'different than' sounds a bit odd to me 
</I>&gt;<i> here; maybe I'd prefer 'different from'.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;putImageData(image, dx, dy)&quot; - maybe s/image/imagedata/, because it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not at all the same as the 'image' parameter in drawImage.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;If getContext() is called with that exact string for tis contextId 
</I>&gt;<i> argument ...&quot; - s/tis/its/
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;while one could create an ImageData object, one would net necessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> know what resolution the canvas expected&quot; - s/net/not/
</I>
Fixed.
