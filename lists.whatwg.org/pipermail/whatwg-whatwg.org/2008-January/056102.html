<PRE>I'll try to look at the updated spec later tonight, and see if i can  
see if there's anything for which it seems sensible to me for canvas  
to throw (or not throw) left in the spec.

My current feeling is that for most operations it is sane to fail  
silently for out of bounds numbers, inf, or nan -- but that's just  
because i'd prefer people to not have to litter their code with  
exception handlers and/or manual bounds checks -- given i assume most  
people will just be either ignoring (by catching) exceptions, or make  
the call conditional on manually checked values being safe it seems  
reasonable to offload such tasks from the developer to the interpreter.

&lt;ramble&gt;
OTOH, there are things like putImageData, drawImage, ... where it  
makes sense to throw if you are (for instance) not given correct  
*data* -- things like nan, inf, etc can occur as an edge case of many  
trivial expressions which make it difficult to check all scenarios  
for sane output, but it seems truly bogus for something of a  
completely incorrect type to be passed as say the image or ImageData  
arguments.
&lt;/ramble&gt;
