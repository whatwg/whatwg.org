I did wonder about why other origins could read anything myself, so  
you're not
alone -- it just seemed especially odd to allow images to be written  
safely but not
ImageData.

I'm as yet unsure whether a separate origin should be able to write --  
i have nothing
to back this up with but it seems that you could potentially right to  
a canvas from a
separate domain to make the canvas look like something it wasn't --  
but i'm not familiar
enough with the other origin related policies in html5 to be able to  
say anything
meaningful.

I only noticed this as i was looking at the ImageData portion of the  
spec just now :D

I assume there was a reason that reading from the canvas from another  
origin is ever
allowed, but I can't think of what it might be -- any thoughts/ 
recollections from others
would be well received :D
