<PRE>So I came across this wonderful piece of javascript:
<A HREF="http://jsmsxdemo.googlepages.com/jsmsx.html">http://jsmsxdemo.googlepages.com/jsmsx.html</A>

If present it uses putImageData (and getImageData to get the ImageData  
object, which isn't required by html5 now -- and i think hixie was  
look at doing some more work with ImageData).

With the current model for putImageData there is no way for them to  
specify a dirty rect, which means their only option is to update the  
entire display -- they have to copy the entire buffer.  If  
putImageData were to take an optional dirty rect parameter we could  
reduce the amount of work necessary, and still maintain backwards  
compatibility.  My attention was drawn to this as a brief bit of  
hackery in webkit showed that the above webapp only updates the  
necessary dirty parts of a frame and yet Opera and Firefox both *have*  
to copy, blit and repaint the entire canvas, ironically because they  
both provide the faster get/putImageData API's (this is not to suggest  
either implementation is in any way slow, just that it seems we are  
missing a perfectly reasonable API to improve performance beyond what  
has already been achieved).

Anyway, i was thinking we would just need to putDataImage methods:
void putImageData(in ImageData imagedata, in float dx, in float dy);
void putImageData(in ImageData imagedata, in float dx, in float dy, in  
float dirtyX, in float dirtyY, in float dirtyWidth, in float  
dirtyHeight);

Where the dirtyX and dirtyY are relative to the ImageData's origin.

The repaint region would be (dx+dirtyX, dy+dirtyY),  
dirtyWidth*dirtyHeight in the canvas domain, and (more importantly)  
only that subsection of the ImageData would need to be copied, and in  
the case of those UAs that need it, unpremultiplied.  This could  
result in significant gains for more complex uses of canvas, like the  
one above.

Compatibility:
If the dirty rect is provided to a UA that doesn't support it (eg. new  
content in old/current Opera, Firefox) the entire ImageData will be  
blitted as would currently be expected (opera and firefox both ignore  
extraneous arguments on putImageData, i'm not sure about konqueror/ 
khtml).

If a dirty rect is not provided (eg. old content in a newer UA) the  
entire block would be considered dirty, and so repaint as expected.

Any thoughts?
