Seems like a reasonable idea to me. The correlation should be at least as 
high, as far as I can tell. But that's just a guess. Data would be good, 
for example instrumenting an existing locale-based browser to see how 
often the guess from the locale disagrees with the guess from the TLD, and 
checking how often the guess from the locale is wrong (via looking at 
people overriding the encoding manually). Or maybe a 50%/50% experiment 
with that as the first 50% and the default coming from the TLD instead of 
the UI locale in the second 50%, with the corresponding instrumentation, 
to see how the results compare.

Have you tried deploying this? What have you learnt so far?
