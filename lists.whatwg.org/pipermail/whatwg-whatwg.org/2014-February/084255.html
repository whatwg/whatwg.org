</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea of the inputmode=&quot;&quot; attribute is that it gives the mode that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is most likely to be needed by the user when providing input. There's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; various modes that seem to make sense:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting raw latin-script characters, like passwords, product 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    codes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting human-readable latin-script short-form text, like search
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    queries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting human-readable latin-script human names
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting human-readable latin-script long-form text, like blog 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    posts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting numeric data, like credit card numbers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting text in other scripts, of which I know nothing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - inserting human-readable latin-script text within long-form text in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    other scripts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You don't use the same kind of keyboard for inserting raw latin-script 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; characters as for inserting Japanese long-form prose, so it makes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sense to me that they'd use different input modes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why is this wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally think it's not wrong. Well, mostly not wrong, at least (see 
</I>&gt;<i> below for what I think is one specific, fixable problem.) But I believe 
</I>&gt;<i> one objection that others have made to the current set of modes is that 
</I>&gt;<i> for Latin input it provides values that conflate typing-aids hints with 
</I>&gt;<i> the script hint, while for Japanese input, it does not.
</I>
Well, nobody has suggested that there are any typing aid hints applicable 
to Japanese input yet. The current list for Japanese (and all non-Latin- 
script languages) are just the list of input modes people told me were 
needed (since nobody has asked for anything for anything but Japanese and 
Latin-script languages, there's nothing for those).


&gt;<i> That means there's at least one possibly-useful mode that inputmode 
</I>&gt;<i> currently does make expressible: a &quot;name&quot; mode for kana input (to 
</I>&gt;<i> correspond to the latin-name mode).
</I>
Added.


&gt;<i> What I mean is, what value would an author choose if they wanted to 
</I>&gt;<i> indicate a mode for inserting human-readable kana-input human names?
</I>
As of now, &quot;kana-name&quot;.


&gt;<i> Asking that question makes me realize that we probably don't actually 
</I>&gt;<i> want a &quot;-name&quot; mode for the contact-list case anyway -- because a 
</I>&gt;<i> Japanese user is likely to have a contact list that contains names both 
</I>&gt;<i> in Kanji and in Latin characters. So if we really want to provide &quot;text 
</I>&gt;<i> prediction from the user's contact list&quot;, I think we'd probably want to 
</I>&gt;<i> just add an script-less inputmode=contact value for that.
</I>
If there was going to be a &quot;keyboard&quot; that consisted primarily of a 
contact list, I'd agree. But the keyboard will be a keyboard, and it'll 
autocomplete from a contact list. And thus that keyboard needs a default 
mode to be in. If all my friends have Latin-script names, it is 
inconvenient if the keyboard starts with a Russian keyboard. I presume, 
based on what you suggested above, that a Japanese user would find it more 
helpful if their keyboard started in a mode for &quot;kana or romaji input, 
typically hiragana input&quot;.


&gt;<i> Also, there are things other than human names for which namecase (aka 
</I>&gt;<i> titlecase) is useful: For example, a field where the user is expected to 
</I>&gt;<i> type in a book title or movie title. For those kinds of fields, you 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly wouldn't want &quot;text prediction from the user's contact list&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> turned on also. Instead you'd just want it to be inputmode=titlecase.
</I>
If users actually want auto-title-casing, then yes, we could introduce a 
&quot;latin-title-case&quot; mode, or something like that. Do they? I haven't heard 
of a request for this so far.


&gt;<i> Anyway, I think the root problem might be that we have 
</I>&gt;<i> inputmode=latin-name to begin with.
</I>
I don't understand why it's a problem.


&gt;<i> So I'd suggest either dropping it entirely, or replacing it with the two 
</I>&gt;<i> new values inputmode=titlecase and inputmode=contact.
</I>
That wouldn't give the UA the information the UA needs to pick the right 
keyboard.


&gt;<i> And as far as using inputmode for specifying typing aids instead of just 
</I>&gt;<i> script, I don't what other kinds of typing aids (other than the contact 
</I>&gt;<i> case) would be relevant for Japanese input. The main typing aids the 
</I>&gt;<i> spec mentions are autocapitalization, autocorrect, and text prediction. 
</I>&gt;<i> Among those, capitalization isn't relevant for Japanese input at all. 
</I>&gt;<i> And as far as autocorrect, in my experience at least, autocorrect isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> a feature that's commonly used anywhere with IMEs for Japanese input, so 
</I>&gt;<i> it's not relevant. And as far as text prediction, in Japanese IMEs text 
</I>&gt;<i> prediction is always turned on anyway, and I can't think of cases where 
</I>&gt;<i> a user would really care to have it turned off (or be bothered by having 
</I>&gt;<i> it on).
</I>
Right, each script has different needs. That's why these are not 
orthogonal concerns; they're input modalities.

I don't know anything about what input modalities are needed outside of 
Latin script keyboards, so I rely on people reporting what is missing so 
that I can add it.


&gt;<i> Come to think of it, in soft keyboards on smartphones for Latin input too,
</I>&gt;<i> text prediction is always on anyway.
</I>
Not always. For example, you wouldn't want to have it on in a password 
field or URL field.


&gt;<i> So maybe these days there's not much of a real need to provide a hint 
</I>&gt;<i> for a &quot;text prediction on&quot; typing aid -- because &quot;text prediction on&quot; is 
</I>&gt;<i> the default anyway. Maybe instead there's now more of a need for a &quot;text 
</I>&gt;<i> prediction off&quot; typing aid, I dunno.
</I>
The spec doesn't have a default mode and an &quot;on&quot; mode (or &quot;off&quot; mode), it 
just has various different modes, some with and some without certain 
features (or rather, hints as to whether those features should be there or 
not by default).
