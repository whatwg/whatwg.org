</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What's the concrete use case?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How can I get more concrete than there's a list box inside a canvas?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If so, I feel comfortable saying that we don't need to make &lt;canvas&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support that, since that use case is already handled very well by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;select&gt; element.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I argued above, maybe we can't come up with a really good use-case, but
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.

Absence of evidence is at least weak evidence of absence.
Quote &lt;<A HREF="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Absence_of_evidence</A>&gt;:

You hear some rustling noises in your backyard, and you want to figure
out if the noises were caused by your neighbor's dog or by some other
intruder. Fortunately, you know what your neighbor's dog is like - he's
rambunctious and he barks constantly. So you listen closely, and after
20 minutes you don't hear any barking. What should you conclude?

&gt;<i> I'll try, though: what if I had a list of choices displayed as a pie chart?
</I>&gt;<i> Each slice of the pie is a focusable object that, when you click on it,
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to take an action on that pie slice.
</I>
What if I look at that page in a textual user agent?

&gt;<i> Surely you'd agree that rendering a pie chart is a natural use-case for the
</I>&gt;<i> canvas element.
</I>
Nope. If it is just decoration, you should use CSS. Look at source code:
&lt;<A HREF="http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/src/css-pie-chart-form.html">http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/src/css-pie-chart-form.html</A>&gt;

(For pages like these, I have a hotkey for &#8220;disable CSS&#8221;.)

&gt;<i> I know it's technically possible in css, but it's quite
</I>&gt;<i> tricky - whereas it's simple and natural in canvas. And there are plenty of
</I>&gt;<i> shapes that are basically impossible in pure CSS.
</I>
I might consider that a good thing. May I ask if you have designed
human-computer interfaces. If so, may you provide examples?

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; What if I do want a &lt;select&gt;, but I just want a canvas to render it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; visually?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are Web Components and CSS unable to get the effects you need? Maybe we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be improving those rather than &lt;canvas&gt;. It's hard to tell without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowing precisely what you want to do.
</I>
This requests reminds me of customers wanting &#8220;page intro in flash.&#8221;.

&gt;&gt;<i> If a region has a car theft problem, you don't solve it by giving all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thieves the car keys. You solve it by improving the economy so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thieves have better things to do (like get an interesting job), and you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solve the remainder by improving law enforcement. The same applies here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We solve it by providing better tools for custom text editing controls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. better contenteditable APIs), and by making it non-conforming to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abuse &lt;canvas&gt; for this purpose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest a different analogy: suppose your company makes foam pipe
</I>&gt;<i> insulation and you discover people are buying your product and using it as
</I>&gt;<i> a swimming pool flotation device. Do you try to stop them from using your
</I>&gt;<i> product and try to get them to purchase other pool toys, or do you start
</I>&gt;<i> selling your pipe insulation directly to the sporting goods stores?
</I>
You might check if the pipe insulation is toxic, first.
