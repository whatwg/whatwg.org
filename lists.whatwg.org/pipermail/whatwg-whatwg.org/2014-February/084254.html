I think this would just result in authors keeping track of the ports in an 
index, which would prevent them from being GC'ed, which defeats the point.

I don't think &quot;solvable&quot; is the same as &quot;design an API that basically 
guarantees that within a decade most of the Web won't be bfcached&quot;.

Done.
