Step 3. Step 4 is about canceling an existing navigation if you hit back.


&gt;<i> It's not clear from the spec which browsing context and document these

</I>&gt;<i> document of that context (I think that makes most sense)?
</I>
Hm. I meant it to be the Document of the History object, but you raise an 
interesting point. This whole thing is rather poorly defined.

I've tried to clear it up.


&gt;<i> Additionally it isn't clear which event loop the task should be 
</I>&gt;<i> associated with.
</I>
I've tried to clear this up too. It turns out this wasn't taking into 
account per-frame process isolation, anyway. I had to introduce yet 
another kind of event loop. This does introduce some race conditions in 
UAs with more than one event loop per tab, but I don't know what we can do 
about that without adding in a lot of blocking during traversal, which I 
am guessing wouldn't be popular.


&gt;<i> &gt; Aah, ok. The spec already says that's not allowed. You can't get to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the History object of a cross-origin Window:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#security-window">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#security-window</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I forget what the story is if you get a History object from a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same-origin Window, then have the browsing context navigated, then use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the History object you kept around... I expect it is supposed to work 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much as if you were to call it on the new, cross-origin, History 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object, though.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The implication here as that you should never be able to do a history 
</I>&gt;<i> traversal of a browsing context that is not same origin (and so there is 
</I>&gt;<i> only one event loop to choose from).  The &quot;story&quot; about keeping history 
</I>&gt;<i> objects around seems does not seem to be specified anywhere (so the 
</I>&gt;<i> assumption was that it should work as normal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like some browsers don't let you use history objects you kept 
</I>&gt;<i> around (they should probably throw an InvalidStateError), others let you 
</I>&gt;<i> use them if the current document of the relevant browsing context is 
</I>&gt;<i> same-origin (and should probably throw a SecurityError).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's rather awkward to test this, but can we have something in the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent cross-origin history traversal?  If this is not in the same 
</I>&gt;<i> section as the &quot;traverse the history by a delta&quot; algorithm can we have a 
</I>&gt;<i> note to say that this can never happen cross-origin?
</I>
Well, no, not really, because it can. For example, if you have an iframe 
that's cross-origin, and it's navigated, and then you call your own 
History object's back() method, it'll actually traverse that iframe.

But a History object of a non-active Document is a different matter...

Looks like this will need help from WebIDL. I've filed bug 23359 and 
marked it as blocked on bug 23358:
