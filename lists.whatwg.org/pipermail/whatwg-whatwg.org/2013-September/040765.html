</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why &lt;video controls&gt; should be any different than, say, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;button&gt; here. If I install an event handler on an ancestor of an 
</I>&gt;<i> element, I'm able to capture events and prevent the descendent element 
</I>&gt;<i> from seeing them.
</I>
It's more similar to clicking on a context menu (or indeed a menu bar) 
than clicking on a button, IMHO. Or like clicking on a control in the 
popup from &lt;input type=file&gt;. Or clicking in the colour wheel that pops up 
when you active an &lt;input type=color&gt; control.

A &lt;button&gt; is an in-page control. A &lt;video&gt;'s controls are not an in-page 
control -- there's no in-page element for them, they might not even be 
positioned over the page (they could be on a palette that the user has 
dragged out of the page).

Also, with &lt;button&gt; the UA and the page are working together. The UA 
renders the button and shows how it is being pressed; the author makes it 
do something. The case we're talking about here is where the user presses 
a button and both the user agent and the author want to do something (and 
the author has no way to know what the user agent wants to do, or what the 
user thinks will happen).


&gt;<i> A UI which allows users to activate a control &quot;regardless of what the 
</I>&gt;<i> page does in its event handlers&quot; is a general feature not specific to 
</I>&gt;<i> media elements&#8212;and may be worth considering&#8212;but we shouldn't make a 
</I>&gt;<i> one-off exception to the basic model of DOM events just for &lt;video&gt;.
</I>
I agree that it's not specific to &lt;video&gt;, but I don't think we have to 
mention it for other things because it's only &lt;video&gt; where the spec 
suggests having such a UI model and where browsers have historically also 
fired an event.

Seem pretty reasonable to me. How else would you make the video play/pause 
when you click the video frame, yet also have UA controls?

I don't see why. It's what I'd do.

That seems unrelated to this issue, unless I'm missing something.

The change wouldn't affect this as far as I can tell. We're talking about 
interaction with specific controls enabled by controls=&quot;&quot; (or manually by 
the user).

I'm not sure what you want in the spec here. Can you elaborate?

It's not documented in the spec, but it seems reasonable.

Should we make this an explicit activation behaviour for the &lt;video&gt; 
element if it has a controls=&quot;&quot; attribute?

True, but there _is_ something now that says that if the browser considers 
it the user interacting with a control, that there shouldn't be events 
sent to the page. It's either a control (no events), or an activation 
behaviour (click events, can be canceled by preventDefault()).

</I>
I think doing both is perfectly reasonable, especially since we don't 
define an explicit activation behaviour currently.


&gt;<i> This is why I am saying: Philip's example is not a typical use case. It

</I>
There's no way for a page to definitely prevent the user from enabling 
these controls. A browser could always have some other way to enable them, 
or allow access to the context menu regardless, etc.


&gt;<i> However, the patch has a wider implication: namely that the User agent 
</I>&gt;<i> will suppress all user interaction events from the browser-provided 
</I>&gt;<i> video controls. I.e. if the user clicks on the play button, no click 
</I>&gt;<i> event is raised on the video element and the elements that the video 
</I>&gt;<i> element is in. That's what Edward is objecting to - and I agree.
</I>
Why do you object? What sense is there in sending the event to the page?

How can you tell what they clicked?

Indeed.

No, the problem is that the page's logic interacts with the browser's 
logic in a way that nobody can predict or handle.

You can't force the user to do anything. They control the computer, at the 
end of the day, and can do whatever they want.

Since you don't know what the controls can do, I don't see how that makes 
sense.

What if you want to mute the volume when the user clicks on a non-control 
part of the video, but do nothing when they click on the controls?

You can't do it without the browser suppressing events when the user is 
interacting with the controls.


&gt;<i> It also means that in the case of Firefox or in the case of Android 
</I>&gt;<i> Chrome, where the native controls cover the full video with a overlay 
</I>&gt;<i> button when not on autoplay, you cannot get any onclick events on the

Right, that seems perfectly reasonable.

That seems like it would be far more complicated than necessary. What's 
the use case? (Why would you ever want the event when the user did click 
on a control?)

We're talking about a lot of complexity here, we shouldn't do that unless

Indeed.

The API is very carefully designed to enable multiple independent

page controls.

We already have all these events (not precisely how you describe them, but 
more or less). Please do see the spec:

If you click one of the controls on that video, right. It's similar to 
what happens if you click another window, or in an &lt;iframe&gt;. (It's

What use cases does it break that aren't already broken?
