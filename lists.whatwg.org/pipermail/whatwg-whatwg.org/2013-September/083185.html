<PRE>I would just like to note that sometimes we do not WANT to draw precise 
shapes. :) Many people enjoy the aesthetic of 2d pixel-based graphics, 
and it should be a viable choice for the graphical style of a game, for 
instance. Canvas makes this more difficult, and it shouldn't be so!

Why can't we have a global option to turn this off if we want to? I'm 
not trying to advocate for throwing away all antialiasing... I 
understand that most applications will probably want it by default, and 
agree with having it as the default.

Basically all it is is

... except that we're not talking about scaling.

</I>&gt;<i> draw a line that's neither horizontal nor vertical yet is crisp and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I created an example (in flash sorry) that shows the feature:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 sets of strokes move across the screen and are also scaled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The top strokes behave like canvas does today. They start of blurry and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during the animation they slowly get ticker. For some reason it doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look very smooth.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The bottom strokes have hinting turned on. They are sharp at the beginning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and during the animation they stay the same size until the internal stroke
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> width is large enough. At that point you see a 'jump'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think canvas should have a similar feature...
</I>&gt;<i> Can you elaborate on how exactly you would want this to work? How would
