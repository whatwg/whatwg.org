It wasn&#8217;t just that. A lot of existing code did something like this:

var pixels = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
for (var i = 0; i &lt; canvas.width; i++) {
  for (var j = 0; j &lt; canvas.height; j++) {
    pixels[j * canvas.width + i][0] = newRedValue;
    pixels[j * canvas.width + i][1] = newGreenValue;
    pixels[j * canvas.width + i][2] = newBlueValue;
  }
}
ctx.putImageData(&#8230;)

i.e. no one read the spec that says you should check the width and height
of the returned ImageData.

Then there is toDataURL(). Should that return a full-sized bitmap? Then you
need to be sure what you&#8217;re uploading it to will handle the larger size.

Basically, there was pretty unanimous support from Web developers to
&#8220;just give us the damn pixels we asked for&#8221;, as well as Chrome and Mozilla
suggesting they didn&#8217;t want to implement the auto-doubling.

We (Safari) were in a position where we were requiring developers to
write extra code just for us, as well as potentially breaking some
(existing) content.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As much as sites do this manually, though, it's a huge pain in the neck to 
</I>&gt;<i> have to worry about pixel density when you're creating your canvas and 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing on it, especially if you're not drawing sprites on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While we're talking about annoying things, there's also the annoyance that 
</I>&gt;<i> canvases tend to not take zoom into account (either density-affecting zoom 
</I>&gt;<i> like page zoom on desktop, or &quot;transparent&quot; zoom like pinch-zoom on mobile 
</I>&gt;<i> for non-mobile-optimised sites, which the site isn't supposed to know 
</I>&gt;<i> about): you have to remember to listen for onresize, and then manually 
</I>&gt;<i> blow away your canvas and recreate it at the right density and then 
</I>&gt;<i> squeeze it into place so that the coordinate space matches what your code 
</I>&gt;<i> is expecting while the &lt;canvas&gt; is actually sized for the display.
</I>
Yes, but I think the developer is the one who best knows what size/quality
her content requires.

A great developer will do exactly as you suggest: constantly examine the
rendered size of the canvas (taking into account pixel density and viewport/zoom).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's also the issue of full-bleed canvases where every time the 
</I>&gt;<i> container changes, you have to remember to re-update the canvas coordinate 
</I>&gt;<i> space and repaint because otherwise your pretty page gets all warped.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to fix these all at once, and I think we can, by 
</I>&gt;<i> introducing a configuration option on getContext(), in the style of WebGL:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   getContext('2d', { density: 'autosize' });
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would trigger the following behaviour: When the context is created, 
</I>&gt;<i> and subsequently when the &lt;canvas&gt; changes size (e.g. due to being sized 
</I>&gt;<i> with CSS relative units and the element they're relative to changing), or 
</I>&gt;<i> when the display density changes size (e.g. due to page zoom), then:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - the width and height of the canvas bitmaps get updated to match the
</I>&gt;<i>     new native size of the &lt;canvas&gt;, at native density.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - the coordinate space of the canvas (context.width/context.height) 
</I>&gt;<i>     gets updated to match the size of the &lt;canvas&gt; in CSS pixel units.
</I>
Note that this would reset the context, which would throw away the contents
and context state. This might be exactly what you want though - put
this attribute on a full-bleed canvas and resize your window -&gt; everything
disappears unless you implement the &#8216;resize&#8217; event handler.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - a 'resize' event gets fired at the &lt;canvas&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would dump the *HD versions of the methods, and make the regular ones 
</I>&gt;<i> go back to returning the actual raw pixels, since that would now work fine 
</I>&gt;<i> and still provide HD-quality content everywhere it's available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do people think?
</I>
This seems ok to me. I still worry we&#8217;ll get into a situation where developers
will add density:&#8217;autosize&#8217; (in order to get the resizing behaviour) and NOT check
the results of getImageData - everything will work fine if they never test on
a high-dpi screen.

Maybe there should be two attributes?
