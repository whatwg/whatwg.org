<PRE>Hi Boris,

Thanks, this is really helpful.

Interesting, I had just assumed this was okay &#8211; is it not spec-compliant for Window.prototype to be a named properties object?

&gt;&gt;<i> attributes of the value are configured differently, with enumerable set to false, writable and configurable set to true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Current tip Firefox returns {&quot;configurable&quot;:true,&quot;enumerable&quot;:true,&quot;writable&quot;:true} and enumerates the properties.  Probably a change from <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=895758">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=895758</A> to align better with the spec in terms of the enumeration behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There seem to be some compelling reasons to follow Firefox / Chrome (writable true seems more congruent with ECMA262 specified [[Put]]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.  I think the current setup in the spec would make window.foo not settable if &lt;img id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; exists....  That seems bad.
</I>
I believe these properties are implemented as shadowable in the same way as [Replaceable] properties, so I was somewhat expecting the spec to define properties returned by named property objects to implicitly have the [Replaceable] extended attribute specified in WebIDL (and then assume a modified behaviour of ES [Put] for properties with this attribute, to permit overwrite even if readonly).  But I&#8217;m not yet familiar enough with the spec to know if this is a reasonable line of thought. :-)

Thanks,
Gavin

&gt;&gt;<i> unless there is another mechanism I&#8217;m missing here, enumerable is odd since I don&#8217;t think the spec says anything about [[GetOwnPropertyNames]])
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't, but it does talk about enumeration; see <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#property-enumeration">http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#property-enumeration</A> (whether that's applicable to the Named Properties Object is an interesting question).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, I would rather that were defined in terms of [[GetOwnPropertyNames]] on the relevant objects instead; that's what actually needs to happen under the hood anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ,so I was hoping to better understand why the spec requires the behaviour it does (or whether I&#8217;m just following it incorrectly!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're following it correctly; it's just buggy.  ;)
