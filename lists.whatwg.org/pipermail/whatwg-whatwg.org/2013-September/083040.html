It would be better if the resize didn't happen until the page is actually
ready to re-render.  That way, the canvas doesn't flicker if it's rendered
before the page actually does render (eg. it may need to reload resources
to render).  Rendering a blurry canvas briefly is better than rendering a
blank canvas.

For example, add a method &quot;resizeToCurrentDPI()&quot;, and don't do it
automatically at all.  Fire an event when calling the method *would* cause
a change of canvas size.  The page can then load resources asynchronously
as needed, and call the method when it's ready to redraw, avoiding any
period where a blank canvas might be composited.


&gt;<i> Yeah, my suggestion, if we do this, would be to not do it until high
</I>&gt;<i> density displays are even more widely available than now. This is mostly a
</I>&gt;<i> convenience and performance-improving API, not a critical feature add.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
High-DPI displays are already widespread in mobile (all Apple devices
except for the iPad Mini; the Kindle Fire HD), and by contrast there's no
sign of them for desktops, so I think we're either there now or we won't be
for a long time.
