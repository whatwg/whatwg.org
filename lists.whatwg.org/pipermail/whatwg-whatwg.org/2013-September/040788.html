Seems like this would have the same problems as resetClip(), since it's 
essentially the same as a call to resetClip() followed by a call to clip().

Wouldn't that be the same as just save()/clip()/restore() ?

</I>
The main use case would be something like:

   c.save();
   c.resetTransform();
   c.resetClip();
   // draw something at the top right...
   c.restore();

...deep inside some draw code.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, resetMatrix could be defined to do the same.

</I>&gt;<i> Is that API defined somewhere?

I think Justin meant resetTransform().

</I>&gt;<i> Here's a simple use case: Suppose there are nested objects to be drawn,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The drawing structure is hierarchical, and drawn elements may be offset
</I>&gt;<i> from their immediate parent. So a drawing hierarchy might look like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Panel(A)
</I>&gt;<i>     Panel(B)
</I>&gt;<i>         TextBlock
</I>&gt;<i>     TextBlock
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is, Panel(A) contains Panel(B) and a TextBlock. And Panel(B) contains
</I>&gt;<i> another TextBlock. In practice, nesting could be much deeper and more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now suppose also that Panels have some settings, such as a maximum width,
</I>&gt;<i> that might cause their visual elements to be clipped. So a panel might need
</I>&gt;<i> to save(), clip(), draw all of its children, and then restore(). Nesting
</I>&gt;<i> means multiple levels of clipping, for instance with the above hierarchy it
</I>&gt;<i> might look like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Panel(A)
</I>&gt;<i>     clip (save)
</I>&gt;<i>     drawChildren:
</I>&gt;<i>         Panel(B)
</I>&gt;<i>             clip (save)
</I>&gt;<i>             drawChildren:
</I>&gt;<i>                 TextBlock
</I>&gt;<i>                     sets font X
</I>&gt;<i>                     fillText
</I>&gt;<i>             restore
</I>&gt;<i>         TextBlock
</I>&gt;<i>             sets font X
</I>&gt;<i>             fillText
</I>&gt;<i>     restore
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is problematic, because it means:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I must use save() and restore(), which are slow in their own right
</I>
I'm pretty sure save() and restore() are the right solution here. If those 
don't work, we should fix those, not add more features that might have 
their own issues.


&gt;<i> 2. The usage of save() and restore() means that, even if all (or most) of
</I>&gt;<i> my fonts are set to the same value, I have to keep setting them over and
</I>&gt;<i> over. Setting the font is slow in practice, even if it is set to the same
</I>&gt;<i> value as before, and so it should be cached if at all possible.
</I>
Again, if settings fonts is slow, that should be fixed independently of 
resetClip().

</I>
There's no reason save() and restore() need be slow just because they save 
a lot. It's relatively easy to have a stack that only saves the things 
that have changed (e.g. by setting a bit when you change things, so you 
know what has changed, and then only pushing onto the stack the 
instructions to change the stuff that has changed).

</I>
save() and restore() should have no reason to go through the CSS parser.

I don't understand what problem this is solving.

</I>
This is the argument for resetClip(), though the only use case seems to be 
the one I mentioned (drawing something at the top right, or whatever, deep 
inside some code that has clipped and transformed).

I've marked the resetClip() feature in the spec as being considered form 
removal. If no browser implement it in due course, I'll remove it. Despite 
being relatively commonly requested, it must be admitted that the use 
cases for this feature aren't that compelling.
