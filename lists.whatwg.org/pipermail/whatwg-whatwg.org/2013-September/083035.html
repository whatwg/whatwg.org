Arguably. Signaling auto-rotation inhibited requirements isn't, though. That's application-level. Auto-rotation inhibition needs to be automatic and scoped to the document.
&gt;<i> &gt; So this isn't so much about forcing orientation as it is about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inhibiting auto-rotation.

</I>
The UA is free to provide whatever UI it wants to allow the user to enable/disable auto-rotation inhibition and/or pick a preferred orientation. From the use cases can be derived requirements for the content author to be able to signal to the UA the preference to inhibit auto-roation. Whether the UA decides to comply to this stated pref, allow its user to override it, etc. should be implementation-specific.
&gt;<i> &gt; Your desktop comparison is inadequate, as there aren't comparable

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> It would be equivalent to forcing a particular window size.
</I>
No. A better analogy is the autoplay feature of video elements. Merely a hint that can be overridden by the user/UA.

And frankly even that comparison is dodgy: playing a video doesn't have close to the discoverability and usability issues inhibiting auto-rotation at the OS level has.

Agreed these requirements are generally tied to fullscreen/absence of browser-chrome context. Unfortunately, this is achieved using a variety of AP across implementations (e.g. iOS/Android?). So this proposition would only cater to those situation where the fullscreen API was used.
