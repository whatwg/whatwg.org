</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - We can enable text field selection APIs for email, number, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other types
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; How would this work when the control isn't a text control? I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; understand. For example, consider a date control that is actually 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; three separate text fields (year month day); how do you envisage 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the selection API working and how would rawValue help with this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think it's ok that rawValue doesn't work with form controls 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; without any text. One of use cases of rawValue would be to handle 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; user input errors.  I think non-text form controls should be clever 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; enough to avoid bad user input. For example, users can't set bad 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; values to input[type=range].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still don't understand how this would work. You suggest that it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should work for type=date, but how? What happens when it's mutated by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; script, for instance? I really don't understand the purpose here or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how it would work to achieve that purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for type=date, rawValue should return what a user see.
</I>
What if the user sees a calendar with a date circled? Or the string &quot;your 
birthday&quot;? (Exposing that would be a privacy violation.) Or what if the 
user doesn't see anything (because it's not a visual UA), but every time 
the user focuses it, the user agent plays a tune from one of Vivaldi's 
four seasons, followed by a trill to indicate how far into the season the 
date is?


&gt;<i> Value set by script or not doesn't matter.
</I>
I mean, how would the user agent parse the script's new value.


&gt;<i> I saw some questions/requests of a way to get a localized date string in 
</I>&gt;<i> crbug.com and stackoverflow.com.  One of reasons one wanted to get it 
</I>&gt;<i> was that there are no ways for script to get localized date format used 
</I>&gt;<i> in type=date. One wanted to get the format to use consistent date format 
</I>&gt;<i> in a web page, another wanted to get the format to focus on specific 
</I>&gt;<i> field in type=date (Note that a type=date instance in Google Chrome 
</I>&gt;<i> contains multiple focus targets.)
</I>
Providing localisation is definitely something we should do, but rawValue 
isn't a sane way to do it. You don't want to have the &quot;format a date&quot; API 
be &quot;create an &lt;input&gt; element, sets its value, and read it back&quot;.


&gt;<i> As for type=number, I heard a web author wanted to get invalid value 
</I>&gt;<i> typed by a user in order to show friendly error message without HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> interactive form validation.
</I>
The point of type=number is that the browser can do this, no need to 
reimplement it. (If an author does want to reimplement it, Web Components 
are presumably the long-term solution: reimplement the widget.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I'd like to enable selection API for at least type=email 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and type=number.  All of their existing implementations are text 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fields. I haven't seen a request to suport selection API for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; type=email, etc.. However lack of selection API looks a defect 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Why does the page need to touch the selection?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It must be same as input[type=text]. e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   - A page author wants to select the whole value or nothing of an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; email form control when it gets focus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why is that a valid thing for a page to be doing? The browser should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take care of doing that, not the page. If the page does it, it'll be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different on each page and the user will get confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can't force it.  Web authors do what they want.
</I>
We can force it. If we don't provide the API, the author can't do it.

</I>&gt;<i> This is an actual case.  I talked with him, and he said &lt;datalist&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't work in his case because he wanted to show images on choices.
</I>
The demo he gives is:

If people want to reimplement widgets, then we should make sure Web 
Components can support their particular widget desires. I don't think it 
makes sense for us to make the default widgets be able to support every 
weird thing people want to do.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   - A user entered an email address with unacceptable domain name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     A page author wants to move the caret to the beginning of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     domain name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How is that possible in the case of a custom e-mail widget where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-mail address isn't shown, but a user picture and name is shown 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think rawValue isn't necessary in such UI. However all of existing 
</I>&gt;<i> type=email implementation is a text field.

Exactly.
