I'm not sure what this means exactly.

</I>&gt;<i> At least Chinese and Korean IME have state.
</I>
inputmode=&quot;&quot; isn't intended to directly decide how the UI works, e.g. 
whether an IME, or what kind of IME, is provided. However, it is intended 
to let browsers make the decision on what kind of IME to provide.


&gt;<i> In this point we should add attributes corresponding to chinese and korean.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether there are any other such a IME but I think many non
</I>&gt;<i> English native people input in alphabet or hir/her native language.
</I>
I would be very happy to add such things, but I don't know what the needs 
are in those languages. I've been waiting for someone to elaborate on what 
exactly is needed.


&gt;<i> So should we add &quot;native&quot; attribute?
</I>
When would you use it?

I don't understand what the difference is.


&gt;<i> And I agree that we need to address Chinese and Korean IME use cases if

</I>
Ok. What are the kinds of input tha Chinese and Korean Web sites need?

</I>
I don't understand the concern here. The attribute is indeed a hint; it 
doesn't tell the browser what UI to show, only what the page thinks the 
user will want to enter.

Yeah, I don't really understand the suggestion above.

Actually, we do, or at least the spec does.
