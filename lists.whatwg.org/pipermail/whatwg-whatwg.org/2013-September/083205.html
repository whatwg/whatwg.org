Yeah... The current name isn't great, but I don't know what would be 
better (without making its name an essay or something).

Some users have great trouble seeing the default focus rings.

It's certainly true that if we don't want to support users with poor 
vision, the API would be simpler. But I don't think that's an option. We 
don't get to arbitrarily ignore some users.

But drawCustomFocusRing() does more than just draw high-contrast focus 
rings. It also moves the magnification, moves the screen-reader focus, 
etc. It does everything drawSystemFocusRing() does other than draw the 
actual focus ring.


&gt;<i> Here's my alternative idea, though: how about calling it something like 
</I>&gt;<i> scrollFocusedObjectIntoView, and have the *primary* purpose of the API 
</I>&gt;<i> be to make the browser scroll the viewport, if needed to make sure that 
</I>&gt;<i> the bounding box of the path is visible, if that object is focused. The 
</I>&gt;<i> drawFocusRing spec would be modified to specify that scrolling the 
</I>&gt;<i> viewport is part of the spec, too.
</I>
How would this differ from scrollPathIntoView() ?
