My goal is for the spec to match the browsers as closely as possible while 
providing direction for the next set of new features.

&gt;<i>From my point of view, therefore, there's two ways to reconcile this 
</I>discrepancy: either the browsers implement what's in the spec, or the spec 
changes to drop the things that aren't getting implemented.

</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;the WebGL model&quot;, I mean:
</I>&gt;<i> - Define a core feature set that's conservative and limited, but 
</I>&gt;<i> consistently implemented by all browsers. Enforce consistent support for 
</I>&gt;<i> it by an exhaustive conformance test suite.
</I>
That's the model we're trying to follow.


&gt;<i> - Let any additional feature be an &quot;extension&quot;.
</I>
The goal is for there to be none of these.


&gt;<i> - Consider, similar to WebGL, further tightening this process by letting
</I>&gt;<i> any new feature start at &quot;draft&quot; status and wait a bit before being
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;approved&quot;.
</I>
That doesn't work. Nobody cares if something is approved or not -- they'll 
use it if it works and it's what they want. Once people use it, it's not 
going anywhere, and the spec is de-facto frozen.


&gt;<i> Typically, the difference that this makes is that &quot;draft&quot; extensions 
</I>&gt;<i> would be exposed by browsers only &quot;behind a flag&quot; (a browser option 
</I>&gt;<i> that's not enabled by default). Prerequisites for &quot;approval&quot; would 
</I>&gt;<i> include: having been implemented and stable for some time, and being 
</I>&gt;<i> covered by a conformance test.
</I>
You can't tell if something is stable until people are using it, so hiding 
features behind a flag, once their implementation is complete, doesn't help.

Precisely.


&gt;<i> I think what's needed is that the person who proposes a feature and gets

</I>&gt;<i> with the browsers so it actually gets implemented.
</I>
Certainly a one-browser feature is no good, specced or not.
