Not always, only if you don't draw the line aligned with the pixel grid 
(e.g. you draw a diagonal line, or a horizontal or vertical line that 
isn't centered in the middle of pixels on the pixels grid, or a horizontal 
or vertical line whose width isn't an integral number of pixels, etc).

The options, on a pixel grid display, are:

 - don't honour the position precisely -- this leads to very ugly 
   artifacts when animating (lines jerk around), and basically means that 
   the graphics aren't accurate.

 - instead of describing the shapes as vectors, describe them using 
   programs that can adapt to the position and size they're being drawn 
   at, such that they automatically snap to the pixel grid in a pretty 
   fashion -- this is what fonts do.

 - try to trick the eye by using anti-aliasing when things don't line up 
   exactly on the pixel grid.

The first two really aren't plausible options for &lt;canvas&gt;.

What is there to fix? The options above are basically the only options. 
You can't not do one of them -- there's no way to draw a crisp line that 
isn't pixel aligned. There's no pixels there. Similarly, there's no way to 
draw a line that's neither horizontal nor vertical yet is crisp and 
doesn't look jaggy. The pixels are squares, they don't rotate on modern 
pixel displays.

</I>
That's precisely the problem with snapping -- it is far worse than 
antialiasing. You can't draw precise shapes if you have snapping.

Indeed.

Can you elaborate on how exactly you would want this to work? How would 
you avoid the alignment and distortion problems when applying this to 
anything less trivial than a rectangle?
