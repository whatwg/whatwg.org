That's intentional, otherwise if you stroke an already-dashed line, you 
get weird results.


&gt;<i> It's also a bit strange that the spec is trying to describe how to stroke.

It's trying to describe sufficient detail to get interoperable behaviour.


&gt;<i> For instance, it goes in minute detail on how dashes are applied but the
</I>&gt;<i> hardest part of stroking (&quot;inflating the paths in path perpendicular to the
</I>&gt;<i> direction&quot;) is not described at all.
</I>
Is there any ambiguity in the part that's not described?


&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be better to remove all these steps and simply show the 
</I>&gt;<i> desired effect?
</I>
Yes. I try to do this as much as possible, but whenever I can't figure out 
a way to describe something declaratively, I describe it imperatively 
instead. If you have a way to describe it that is as precise, covers all 
the same cases, yet is declarative, please don't hesitate to suggest it. I 
unfortunately find that describing things declaratively is usually only 
able to get one 90% of the way to a complete description.


&gt;<i> If not, what would be the best way to fix the wording?
</I>
What's wrong with the wording?


&gt;<i> The mailing list or a bug?
</I>
Either is fine and equivalent. (Don't do both, though, please!).
