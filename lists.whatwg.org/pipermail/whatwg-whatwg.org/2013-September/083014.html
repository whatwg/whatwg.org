<PRE>For posterity, here were our objections to the original high-DPI canvas
spec:

   - The API feels like a short-term hack to automagically do something
   that the developer may or may not want done (e.g., if the game/app was
   tuned for particular resolution, or for pixel-exact rendering) that we'll
   be stuck with in the web platform long after its short-term usefulness has
   expired
   - It doesn't scale well to non-integer devicePixelRatios
   - It is easy for developers to implement the above behaviour in JS if
   desired

I think the new proposal addresses the first point, since it's opt-in. I
don't think the second point is a problem, since [get|put]ImageData() will
be back to manipulating exact backing store pixels, so no non-integer
resizing will be required. The third point becomes moot.

One question: now that some browsers are including browser zoom (page zoom)
in window.devicePixelRatio, will/should the new proposal automatically
cause a resize callback on page zoom, in order to preserve 1:1 device
pixels? (Note that I think this is a problem with current JS-based
implementations of canvas auto-scale as well, although perhaps there's a
DOM event for this that you can listen to; I might just be showing my
ignorance here.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe Apple has also announced that they are dropping support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this in Safari 7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my understanding is that the reason this feature failed is that there's
</I>&gt;<i> existing content that assumes a 1:1 ratio, and having an automatic
</I>&gt;<i> high-density mode was making some pages end up with canvases with four
</I>&gt;<i> canvas pixels per CSS pixel (linearly) -- two from the browser making a
</I>&gt;<i> native canvas, times two from the page scaling the canvas for high DPI
</I>&gt;<i> displays. This is a factor of sixteen over a 1:1 canvas, a factor of four
</I>&gt;<i> more than it should be for high DPI, and a big waste of resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as sites do this manually, though, it's a huge pain in the neck to
</I>&gt;<i> have to worry about pixel density when you're creating your canvas and
</I>&gt;<i> drawing on it, especially if you're not drawing sprites on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While we're talking about annoying things, there's also the annoyance that
</I>&gt;<i> canvases tend to not take zoom into account (either density-affecting zoom
</I>&gt;<i> like page zoom on desktop, or &quot;transparent&quot; zoom like pinch-zoom on mobile
</I>&gt;<i> for non-mobile-optimised sites, which the site isn't supposed to know
</I>&gt;<i> about): you have to remember to listen for onresize, and then manually
</I>&gt;<i> blow away your canvas and recreate it at the right density and then
</I>&gt;<i> squeeze it into place so that the coordinate space matches what your code
</I>&gt;<i> is expecting while the &lt;canvas&gt; is actually sized for the display.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's also the issue of full-bleed canvases where every time the
</I>&gt;<i> container changes, you have to remember to re-update the canvas coordinate
</I>&gt;<i> space and repaint because otherwise your pretty page gets all warped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to fix these all at once, and I think we can, by
</I>&gt;<i> introducing a configuration option on getContext(), in the style of WebGL:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    getContext('2d', { density: 'autosize' });
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would trigger the following behaviour: When the context is created,
</I>&gt;<i> and subsequently when the &lt;canvas&gt; changes size (e.g. due to being sized
</I>&gt;<i> with CSS relative units and the element they're relative to changing), or
</I>&gt;<i> when the display density changes size (e.g. due to page zoom), then:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - the width and height of the canvas bitmaps get updated to match the
</I>&gt;<i>      new native size of the &lt;canvas&gt;, at native density.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - the coordinate space of the canvas (context.width/context.height)
</I>&gt;<i>      gets updated to match the size of the &lt;canvas&gt; in CSS pixel units.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - a 'resize' event gets fired at the &lt;canvas&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would dump the *HD versions of the methods, and make the regular ones
</I>&gt;<i> go back to returning the actual raw pixels, since that would now work fine
</I>&gt;<i> and still provide HD-quality content everywhere it's available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do people think?
