<PRE>There is another closely related issue that's been discussed before: adding
a redraw callback to 2d canvas.  In the past we discussed this for solving
the problem of recoverring from a gpu context loss, but it seems there may
be better reasons to consider adding a redraw callback such as freeing
memory consumed by canvas backing stores that are in background tabs, and
re-building the content when needed. This discussion was revived in the
past few days on the chromium graphics-dev mailing list:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/graphics-dev/CQJXpXxO6dk">https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/graphics-dev/CQJXpXxO6dk</A>

The idea is still embryonic and we're brainstorming in this chromium issue:
crbug.com/287823

I think that discussion should be merged with this thread because a resize
event is another case where one may want to redraw. It would be great to
solve all of these issues together.

&gt;<i> For posterity, here were our objections to the original high-DPI canvas
</I>&gt;<i> spec:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - The API feels like a short-term hack to automagically do something
</I>&gt;<i>    that the developer may or may not want done (e.g., if the game/app was
</I>&gt;<i>    tuned for particular resolution, or for pixel-exact rendering) that
</I>&gt;<i> we'll
</I>&gt;<i>    be stuck with in the web platform long after its short-term usefulness
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i>    expired
</I>&gt;<i>    - It doesn't scale well to non-integer devicePixelRatios
</I>&gt;<i>    - It is easy for developers to implement the above behaviour in JS if
</I>&gt;<i>    desired
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the new proposal addresses the first point, since it's opt-in. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think the second point is a problem, since [get|put]ImageData() will
</I>&gt;<i> be back to manipulating exact backing store pixels, so no non-integer
</I>&gt;<i> resizing will be required. The third point becomes moot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One question: now that some browsers are including browser zoom (page zoom)
</I>&gt;<i> in window.devicePixelRatio, will/should the new proposal automatically
</I>&gt;<i> cause a resize callback on page zoom, in order to preserve 1:1 device
</I>&gt;<i> pixels? (Note that I think this is a problem with current JS-based
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of canvas auto-scale as well, although perhaps there's a
</I>&gt;<i> DOM event for this that you can listen to; I might just be showing my
</I>&gt;<i> ignorance here.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Conversely, if it helps to bring the spec closer to the
</I>&gt;<i> implementations,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; one thing we do not intend to implement in Chrome is the automatic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; high-DPI canvas scaling (ie., auto-doubling of backing stores,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; getImageDataHD(), putImageDataHD(), etc).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I believe Apple has also announced that they are dropping support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this in Safari 7.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So my understanding is that the reason this feature failed is that
</I>&gt;<i> there's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing content that assumes a 1:1 ratio, and having an automatic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-density mode was making some pages end up with canvases with four
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; canvas pixels per CSS pixel (linearly) -- two from the browser making a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; native canvas, times two from the page scaling the canvas for high DPI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; displays. This is a factor of sixteen over a 1:1 canvas, a factor of four
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more than it should be for high DPI, and a big waste of resources.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As much as sites do this manually, though, it's a huge pain in the neck
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to worry about pixel density when you're creating your canvas and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drawing on it, especially if you're not drawing sprites on it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While we're talking about annoying things, there's also the annoyance
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; canvases tend to not take zoom into account (either density-affecting
</I>&gt;<i> zoom
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like page zoom on desktop, or &quot;transparent&quot; zoom like pinch-zoom on
</I>&gt;<i> mobile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for non-mobile-optimised sites, which the site isn't supposed to know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about): you have to remember to listen for onresize, and then manually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blow away your canvas and recreate it at the right density and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; squeeze it into place so that the coordinate space matches what your code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is expecting while the &lt;canvas&gt; is actually sized for the display.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's also the issue of full-bleed canvases where every time the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; container changes, you have to remember to re-update the canvas
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; space and repaint because otherwise your pretty page gets all warped.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be nice to fix these all at once, and I think we can, by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introducing a configuration option on getContext(), in the style of
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    getContext('2d', { density: 'autosize' });
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would trigger the following behaviour: When the context is created,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and subsequently when the &lt;canvas&gt; changes size (e.g. due to being sized
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with CSS relative units and the element they're relative to changing), or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when the display density changes size (e.g. due to page zoom), then:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - the width and height of the canvas bitmaps get updated to match the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      new native size of the &lt;canvas&gt;, at native density.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - the coordinate space of the canvas (context.width/context.height)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      gets updated to match the size of the &lt;canvas&gt; in CSS pixel units.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - a 'resize' event gets fired at the &lt;canvas&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We would dump the *HD versions of the methods, and make the regular ones
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go back to returning the actual raw pixels, since that would now work
</I>&gt;<i> fine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and still provide HD-quality content everywhere it's available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do people think?
