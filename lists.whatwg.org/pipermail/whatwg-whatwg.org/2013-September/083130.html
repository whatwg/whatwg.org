Dramatically simplifying the situation here, we're saying that the 
available options are:

A: All buggy applications fail to compile, because of static checking.
   Cost to fix the bugs is low.

B: All buggy applications break entirely when edge cases are hit.
   Cost to fix the bugs is moderate.

C: Some buggy applications break entirely when edge cases are hit.
   Some buggy applications have data corruption!
   Some buggy applications have merely graphical artefacts.
   Cost to fix the bugs is high.

I think option A is vastly superior, but since that's not an option, 
option B is preferable to option C.

In reality, I don't think it's true that the Web always goes with C. If it 
did, there'd never be exceptions thrown by APIs, and exceptions are thrown 
all the time by APIs. Indeed, if it were the case that we had a philosophy 
of going with &quot;muddling along&quot; where possible, JavaScript wouldn't have 
syntax errors, or, much like CSS, it would have rules for recovering from 
them and would simply ignore syntactically invalid constructs. We don't do 
that. Instead, we chose the middle ground B most of the time.
