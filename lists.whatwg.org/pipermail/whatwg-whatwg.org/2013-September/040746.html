The fragment identifiers resolve that way before the pushState(), too.


&gt;<i> This behavior makes them unsuitable for this kind of applications which

</I>
How do they work in SVG with a &lt;base&gt; with no pushState()?

<A HREF="http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/svg/use/001-with-base.html">http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/svg/use/001-with-base.html</A>

In Safari and Firefox, the relative URLs, even in SVG, are affected by 
&lt;base&gt;, so again, it seems it's &lt;base&gt; that is relevant here, not 
pushState(). (In Chrome, some URLs are resolved locally and some not, 
which is wacked.)


&gt;<i> Does anyone have thoughts on how one could build a client-side app that

</I>&gt;<i> templating or build-time pre-processing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The base element looks like a perfect solution for this, if only it 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't break anchor urls.
</I>
Use only site-absolute URLs, and not &lt;base&gt;, and then everything will work 
fine, as far as I can tell.

It seems pretty consistent.

It's a good question. I thought the old IETF specs for URLs said you had 
to do otherwise, but nobody seems to have implemented that.
