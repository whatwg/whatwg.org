<PRE>
The long and short of this is that I renamed &quot;supportsContext()&quot; to 
&quot;probablySupportsContext()&quot;. It's already implemented in WebKit (and dino 
says he's going to rename it in the implementation also).

Fundamentally, it addresses a need that none of the other proposals 
addressed: how to know whether or not you can expect to be able to do 3D. 
It's not 100% reliable, but then neither would actually attempting to 
create a context, because creating a context is so expensive on some 
platforms that some UAs are going to move to doing it lazily and so you're 
back to exactly the same level of reliability as this API. Plus, it'd be a 
lot more awkward as an API.

</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to question the usefulness of canvas.supportsContext. I tried to

</I>
The use case is libraries like Modernizr that want to do feature detection 
up-front, but don't want a high performance hit on startup.


&gt;<i> However, that only shifts the question to: what is the reason for them 
</I>&gt;<i> to expose such APIs? In the end, I claim that the only thing that we 
</I>&gt;<i> should recognize as a reason to add a feature to the HTML spec, is 
</I>&gt;<i> *application* use cases.
</I>
Oh well the use case for knowing whether or not 3D is supported on a 
particular device is straight-forward: you want to know which set of 
assets and logic to download and run.


&gt;<i> So let's look at the naive application usage pattern for supportsContext:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   if (canvas.supportsContext(&quot;webgl&quot;)) {
</I>&gt;<i>     context = canvas.getContext(&quot;webgl&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that the same can be achieved with just the getContext 
</I>&gt;<i> call, and checking whether it succeeded.
</I>
Suppose you have an app that has a 3D feature, but it's not immediately 
used upon startup. For example, a preview window that is displayed on 
request. You want to preload all the code to run the preview window, but 
you need to load different code based on whether the device can do 3D or 
not. So the use case is more:

   if (canvas.supportsContext(&quot;webgl&quot;))
     load3DCode();
   else
     load2DCode();

   // 3D code:
   function run() {
     context = canvas.getContext(&quot;webgl&quot;);
     // ...
   }

You don't want to pay the cost of creating a throw-away 3D context on 
startup just to know which scripts to load. It defeats the whole point of 
not loading all the code up-front.


&gt;<i> Outside of exceptional cases (out of memory...), the slow path in 
</I>&gt;<i> getContext is the *success* case, and again, in that case a real 
</I>&gt;<i> application would want to actually *use* that context.
</I>
Not necessarily, as noted above. The &lt;canvas&gt; you're going to draw to 
might not even exist at the point you need to know if it's 3D or not.


&gt;<i> Keep in mind that supportsContext can't guarantee that if it returns true,
</I>&gt;<i> then a subsequent getContext will succeed.
</I>
Sure. getContext() can't guarantee that if it returns a context, the 
context will work forever, either.


&gt;<i> The spec doesn't require it to, either. So if the existence of 
</I>&gt;<i> supportsContext misleads application developers into no longer checking 
</I>&gt;<i> for getContext failures, then we'll just have rendered canvas-using 
</I>&gt;<i> applications a little bit more fragile.
</I>
That's a risk, yes.


&gt;<i> Another problem with supportsContext is that it's untestable, at least 
</I>&gt;<i> when it returns true; it is spec-compliant to just implement it as 
</I>&gt;<i> returning whether the JS interface for the required canvas context 
</I>&gt;<i> exists, which is quite useless.
</I>
That would indeed be useless.


&gt;<i> Given such deep problems, I think that the usefulness bar for accepting 
</I>&gt;<i> supportsContext into the spec should be quite high.
</I>
The problem is that there's no alternative solution.

Indeed.


&gt;<i> Like @supports, the supportsContext() method can be easy and reliable

</I>&gt;<i> without breaking sites.
</I>
At least, no capacity beyond the same one that getContext() has in the 
first place, namely that it might return a useful object that later stops 
working.

Indeed. This is supported per the spec, assuming getContext() supports the 
relevant arguments.

I think what the spec requires is as close as one can get to those 
assumptions without requiring something that can't be implemented, no?

Presumably the same as if the first getContext('webgl') call succeeds 
today, but the next getContext('webgl') call fails.

Yeah, it seems to me that the cases where probablySupportsContext() would 
return the wrong result are not that common.

If there's a way to tighten up the requirements in the spec, please do let 
me know. I'm not sure what more to say there right now.

I renamed the method to try to make this clearer.

&quot;doPreference1()&quot; and friends here are most likely to be &quot;fetch the code, 
create the &lt;canvas&gt;es, create the contexts&quot;, etc. Getting the context from 
the feature test all the way to where it is first used seems like a lot of 
complexity.


&gt;<i> It seems overwhelmingly likely that one of the state changes that might

</I>
Can you elaborate on this?


&gt;<i> I don't see how supportsContext() could be as accurate as getContext()

</I>
getContext() isn't 100% accurate either, and it's more expensive.

You could bring these tests forward in the implementation, so that 
probablySupportsContext() itself doesn't have to do them, right?


&gt;<i> Another way in which WebGL specifically can fail, is that some driver

</I>
Wouldn't you know this before the call to getContext(), though?

Wouldn't checking for window.WebGLRenderingContext be just as unreliable 
then? I don't understand why it's ok to be able to test that, but why 
probablySupportsContext() wouldn't be ok.

Right, this would let you close that gap a bit.

probablySupportsContext() takes arguments that affect the answer. (Also, 
the answer can vary over time.)

I'm happy to try to tighten this up if you have any suggestions.
