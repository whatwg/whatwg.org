One caveat: if you use load() to reset the poster image, you'll trigger 
all the events and state changes, and reset the volume, currentTime, 
playbackRate and so on.

Wouldn't it be better to load() the new resource in a separate video 
element, and then swap it into the DOM when it's completed loading and 
seeked to your change over point? Wouldn't that be more seemless?

If we wanted to go down this path, I think a settable attribute 
'postervisible' would be the way to go. Setting to true would show the 
poster, and the browser would automatically hide the poster the next 
time it updates the video frame (the next time playback starts and after 
a seek completes). The attribute would also be readable from script. 
We'd probably want to dispatch a 'posterhidden' event when the poster is 
hidden as well, and maybe a 'postershown'  event as well.

But wouldn't anyone who wanted this level of control have their own 
custom video controls anyway, so that they could ensure they looked the 
same across all browsers? In which case they'd have their own custom 
poster image implementation anyway?
