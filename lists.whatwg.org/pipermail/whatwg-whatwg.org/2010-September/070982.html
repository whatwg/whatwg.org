<PRE>I've changed the subject of this post in the hopes that it receives the
correct attention.

 

As per the current spec:

 

&lt;quote&gt;

WARNING!

User agents should not provide a public API to cause videos to be shown
full-screen. A script, combined with a carefully crafted video file, could
trick the user into thinking a system-modal dialog had been shown, and
prompt the user for a password. There is also the danger of &quot;mere&quot;
annoyance, with pages launching full-screen videos when links are clicked or
pages navigated. Instead, user-agent-specific interface features may be
provided to easily allow the user to obtain a full-screen playback mode.

&lt;/quote&gt;

 

In order for anyone to be able to provide their own skin/player, we'll need
to provide a scriptable way to switch the video element to full screen and
out including events to support the same.

 

I know Webkit folks have provided,
webkitEnterFullScreen/webkitExitFullScreen methods to allow this. I don't
believe there are any events supporting the change in state, however

 

I think it's important that the video element provide a scriptable way to do
this. Internally, the UA can determine if the call was made using a user
gesture as I believe Webkit is doing.

 

Can we agree to change the current spec to allow for this?

 

Shiv
