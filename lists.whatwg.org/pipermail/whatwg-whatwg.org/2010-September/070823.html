Now we're getting somewhere, I really like this proposal.
Actually, with your idea a binary id would complement this as a server 
supporting it could provide accuracy=1.0 in that case.

So I have to say that your accuracy parameter seems quick to add/support 
(both in http header, and in HTML5 meta and other appropriate places?)

And I doubt the Apache Foundation will have much issues supporting this 
either.

I guess we'll have to see what the rest thinks in this list but... a 
solution this slick..
it certainly has my vote, nice work Mikko *thumbs up*.
