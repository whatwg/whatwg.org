Thanks for pointing out these cases. I hadn't thought about it, but my CJK  
is good enough to say something about them:

'&#20327;&#26451;A' encoded in UTF-16BE is 'OggS\x00A'. However, &#20327;&#26451; is nonsensical  
in at least Chinese, neither character is among the 3000 most common  
characters [1]. Search results on Google (4) and Baidu (3) are nonsense  
too. I don't know if things are any different for Japanese, but given the  
Google results I doubt it.

'&#26447;&#21351;' encoded in UTF-16LE is 'OggS', and both of these characters are in  
the top 3000, but together they're nonsense: &quot;apricot crouch&quot;. (That's the  
same &quot;crouch&quot; as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but the order is wrong  
so it doesn't mean &quot;Crouching Apricot&quot;). In the Google and Baidu results,  
the only occurrence of the string seems to be in &quot;&#19968;&#34923;&#32418;&#26447;&#21351;&#27743;&#20141;&quot;, which  
appears to be a theme of an apricot tree by a pavillion that appears in  
several paintings [2] [3] [4].

All in all, I wouldn't be more worried about this than the risk of random  
binary data matching. Also, UTF-16 isn't a very common encoding for  
simplified Chinese (&#21351; is a simplified character), GBK is dominant.

We could also add checking of the 6th byte, which should normally be 0x02  
for &quot;first page of logical bitstream (bos)&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like you could check for 0x1a 0x45 0xdf 0xa3 as the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> four bytes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> U+1A45 is Thai, looks like.  DFA3 is a surrogate, so you're ok there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> U+451A is CJK.  U+A3DF looks like a Yi syllable, so you're more or less  
</I>&gt;<i> ok there too.  I'm assuming you've already checked this byte sequence  
</I>&gt;<i> out in UTF-8 and some other common encodings?
</I>
It's garbage in at least UTF-8, Big5 and GBK.

I'm not sure what infrastructure is in place, but perhaps one could *not*  
sniff if Content-Type also indicates an encoding? That way there's a  
solution for those who really want to display the hypothetical false  
positives as text.
