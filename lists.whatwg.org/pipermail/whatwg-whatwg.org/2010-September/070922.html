<PRE>Hi,

For a few days, Firefox's nightly had a bug related to value sanitizing
which happens to be a specification bug.
With the current specification, these two elements will not have the
same value:
&lt;input value=&quot;foo&#13;bar&quot; type='hidden'&gt;
&lt;input type='hidden' value=&quot;foo&#13;bar&quot;&gt;
Depending on how the attributes are read, value will be set before or
after type, thus, changing the value sanitization algorithm. So, the
value sanitization algorithm of &lt;input type='text'&gt; will be used for one
of these elements and the value will be &quot;foobar&quot;.

The following change would fix that bug:
- The specification should add that the value sanitization algorithm
should not be used during parsing/as long as the element hasn't been
created.
OR
- The specification should add in the set value content attribute
paragraph that the value sanitization algorithm should not be run during
parsing/if the element hasn't been created.

For a specification point of view, both changes would have the same result.

The specifications already require that the value sanitization algorithm
 should be run when the element is &quot;first created&quot;.
So, with this change, the element's value will be un-sanitized during
parsing and as soon as the parsing will be done, the element's value
will be sanitized.

By the way, &quot;first created&quot; could probably be changed to a concept from
the specifications. We can guess what that means but there is no strong
notion behind this words AFAIK.

Thanks,
