<PRE>I'd like to see the implementation of the poster attribute change to
something that is more useful. By useful I mean something that wroks without
the need for javascript and works the way most people would expect.

 

Currently the poster disappears as soon as the first frame has been
downloaded, which typically takes a second. The player then shows this first
frame, but 99% of the time the first frame is black. So what you see is a
black box.

 

The poster frame of a video is probably the most important not only for the
viewer but also for the content producer. It's the one shot the content
producer gets at enticing the viewer to watch her video. Most video websites
therefore provide multiple ways in which the content producer can define a
poster frame for her video.

 

As a result of the current behavior you'll see that most html video player
implementation don't set the source attribute on the video element, so as to
prevent the poster from disappearing or some will overlay an image over the
video element. Ideally, one should be able to simply use the video tag to
get the expected behavior without having to go through hoops.

 

The solution would be the following:

The poster frame should remain visible until the video is played.

The poster should not show while the player is seeking (some browser
implementation do show the poster while seeking, resulting a flashes)

The poster should show again after the video has ended.

The visibility of the poster should be scriptable and/or controllable using
an attribute. Meaning that one should be able to turn on/off the poster
(without changing the poster attrbute's value)

 

Regards,

 

Shiv
