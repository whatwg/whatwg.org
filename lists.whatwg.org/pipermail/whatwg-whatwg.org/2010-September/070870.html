The proper behavior should be that...
if there is a &quot;start poster&quot; then it must be displayed while any 
pre-loading takes place, if there is no pre-loading or auto-play then it 
must remain displayed until the user press play/pause/stop.
if there is a &quot;start poster&quot; then it must be removed if the user press 
play/pause/stop or pre-loading has progressed far enough for autoplay to 
start.

I'd also like to add that...
If the user pauses the video during play then a &quot;paused poster&quot; must not 
be shown as the user most likely intends to study the paused frame of 
the video, if there is a &quot;paused poster&quot; then it must be toggleable 
between &quot;paused poster&quot; and frame by the user as they please, a small 
symbol or control may be shown during the paused frame to indicate there 
is a &quot;paused poster&quot; available.

And I'd also like to add that...
If there is a &quot;end poster&quot; then it must be displayed when the user stop 
the video, or if the last frame of the video is reached then the &quot;end 
poster&quot; but be shown.

Finally I'd like to add that...
There may be one or more posters, the start/pause/end posters may be the 
exact same poster or different posters.
The 3 different types of posters must be scriptable to allow rotation 
between multiple different posters.


Does this sound like something that would satisfy both developers and 
users, without annoying either?

Personally I do not see much point in a &quot;paused poster&quot; but I guess if 
it's scriptable it could act as a info card or maybe repeat the chapter 
title or something like that!

Does posters support hotzones at all? To allow clickable 
items/links/symbols (urls?). Just curious!
