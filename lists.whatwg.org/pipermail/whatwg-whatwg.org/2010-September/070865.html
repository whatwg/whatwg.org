Right, so you want to be able to toggle the poster back on (when the media is paused or ended) but after playback has started.

I wonder if these are separate use cases, e.g. whether users would want to display a different image from the poster image in these cases. i.e. I wonder if we need to provide an attribute to specify an image to display when paused and another new attribute for an image to display when playback has ended. I wonder if that's overkill through.

As regards having more control of the poster&#8217;s visibility,  what I&#8217;m saying is that one should have the ability to turn on/off a poster. Currently once the poster has been made invisible by the UA, there is no way to turn it back on. So if I wanted to turn it back on after the video has ended, I can&#8217;t and I think people should have that choice?

 

I hope that makes sense?

The poster frame should remain visible until the video is played.

 
I agree with Silvia, this should be required by the spec.


This makes sense, we should spec this so that the poster must be visible until its played, otherwise the poster attribute can't be relied upon by authors.










The poster should show again after the video has ended.
 
I'm ambivalent about this.  I could go either way.


Aesthetically, I feel we shouldn't show the poster once the video has finished. Authors could script this behaviour if they wanted it. The spec as it's written forbids showing the poster after a video frame has been shown.






The visibility of the poster should be scriptable and/or controllable using
an attribute. Meaning that one should be able to turn on/off the poster
(without changing the poster attrbute&#8217;s value)

 
I don't see why this is necessary.


I also don't see why this is necessary. The poster attribute is only useful if it's enabled, it's not useful if it isn't. Having an attribute to denote whether the poster attribute is enabled seems like duplication of state to me.





  You can just do
 
video.dataset.poster = video.poster;
video.removeAttribute(&quot;poster&quot;);
 
to remove it, and
 
video.poster = video.dataset.poster;
 
to restore, if you like.  (In browsers that implement dataset, which
is apparently only WebKit so far.  But you can easily store the
original value someplace else, although not quite as elegantly.)
 


The specification for poster [1] implies that we should handle dynamic changes to the poster attribute. I can imagine authors may want to cycle through a chain of poster images for a given video, and this can (theoretically) be easily implemented by changing the poster attribute in a timer.
