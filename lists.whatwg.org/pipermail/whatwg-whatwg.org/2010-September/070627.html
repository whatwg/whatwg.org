Yes.  If false positives were realistically possible by accident, that
would count strongly against sniffing.  If they're not, that at least
is not an issue.

Which use-cases?

Okay, but we're talking about standardizing sniffing in a spec.  As
long as browsers' behavior in processing a given resource is
well-defined and reliable, a proxy could work fine by just
implementing the same algorithm.  There's no reason that the proxy has
to only look at MIME types, is there?  It simplifies the proxy a bit,
but not much.  It will already have to do some content sniffing to
identify what content is dangerous, unless it's just going to block
everything of that file type (which I'm assuming isn't the case).

Put another way: the problem here is not that browsers sniff.  It's
that browsers don't behave interoperably or predictably.  Speccing a
precise sniffing algorithm that everyone's willing to follow allows
proxies to reliably know what browsers will do with it.  What will
cause problems is what you seem to be arguing for -- *not* speccing
sniffing, so that browsers that sniff do so in an ad hoc, undefined
manner that's difficult to predict.  For the use-case of filtering
exploits, it doesn't really matter what the behavior is, so long as
it's consistent.  Or am I missing something here?
