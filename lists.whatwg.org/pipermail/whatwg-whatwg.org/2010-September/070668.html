Yes.  Real-world text documents include all sorts of gunk.  Just rarely.

&gt;&gt;<i> As long as &quot;indicates an encoding&quot; doesn't include UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (thanks, Apache!), that should be reasonable, I think.

</I>
Yes, precisely.  Though the UTF-8 stuff was Linux distros, I think, not 
Apache itself (in that Apache just sent the thing passed to 
AddDefaultCharset and they changed the value of that from ISO-8859-1 to 
UTF-8 in their distro packages).  Here's the relevant comment from the 
Gecko source where we do our text-or-binary sniffing for toplevel contexts:

  Make sure to do a case-sensitive exact match comparison here.  Apache
  1.x just sends text/plain for &quot;unknown&quot;, while Apache 2.x sends
  text/plain with a ISO-8859-1 charset.  Debian's Apache version, just to
  be different, sends text/plain with iso-8859-1 charset.  For extra fun,
  FC7, RHEL4, and Ubuntu Feisty send charset=UTF-8.  Don't do general
  case-insensitive comparison, since we really want to apply this crap as
  rarely as we can.

&gt;<i> I was hoping that no encoding parameter at all would be sent :/
</I>
Heh.  I've long since given up all hope of reason on this stuff; I just 
try to keep it as sane and predictable and simple as possible.  :(
