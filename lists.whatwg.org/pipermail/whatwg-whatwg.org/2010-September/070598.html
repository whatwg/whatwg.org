I never did make that change, instead waiting for the outcome of this  
discussion. Note that since Opera uses the same code path for checking the  
argument to canPlayType and for the Content-Type header, the change would  
also have meant that videos served as application/octet-stream would stop  
working, in violation of the spec.

I'm not very happy with special-casing application/octet-stream only for  
canPlayType, especially as it only handles the exact string  
&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;, not e.g. &quot;application/octet-stream;&quot; which  
would instead be put through the same code path as Content-Type and return  
&quot;maybe&quot;.

At this point the least complex solution seems to be to ignore the  
Content-Type header and unless the teams behind Chrome, Safari and IE9  
have a sudden change of hearts it's the only realistic outcome. Perhaps we  
should also encourage authors to not send the Content-Type header at all,  
to remove any illusions of it having an effect.
