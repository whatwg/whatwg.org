OK.  All versions of Firefox threw at that point.

Well... I guess that depends on how you define &quot;correct rendering&quot;.  The 
case where I ran into was graphing a function; due to Webkit ignoring 
the calls that use NaN the graph is completely wrong (the actual 
function has a singularity at 0 which entirely disappears, with a smooth 
interpolation between two points pretty far away from zero shown instead).

&gt;<i> One old case that failed in the presence of exceptions was the old canvex demo at <A HREF="http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/83/play.xhtml">http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/83/play.xhtml</A> - this was one of the first cases i saw after trying to make webkit's implementation conform to the (older) spec by throwing exceptions on non-finite values we had many canvas using sites break so had to stop throwing.
</I>
OK.  I can believe that this was the case at the time, but it certainly 
wasn't due to Firefox not throwing.  I can see how given people's 
penchant to create browser-specific content changing the webkit behavior 
could cause issues with sites that were targeting only webkit and didn't 
bother testing in anything else.

&gt;<i> It seems to work these days but a quick scan of the minified source seemed to indicate that they now put try/catch around every use of canvas is now wrapped in try/catch
</I>
Right.  Which raises the question of whether this would be an issue 
nowadays.  With the exception of that one graphing demo (which was on a 
&quot;Chrome demos&quot; site, iirc so again is targeting webkit), we have had no 
reports of this being an issue in Gecko.
