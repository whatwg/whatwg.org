<PRE>&gt;<i>Could a call to video.load() reset this state?
</I>


Currently is doesn't affect the poster. But would that be intuitive? I'm
getting the video element to load it's source and so the poster will show?

 

Ideally poster should be an object (a property of the video element) that
has a source property and a visible property. Or to not break current
implementations. The video element could have a method called
showPoster(bool) or a bool property called postervisible.

As regards having more control of the poster's visibility,  what I'm saying
is that one should have the ability to turn on/off a poster. Currently once
the poster has been made invisible by the UA, there is no way to turn it
back on. So if I wanted to turn it back on after the video has ended, I
can't and I think people should have that choice?

 

I hope that makes sense?

The poster frame should remain visible until the video is played.

 
I agree with Silvia, this should be required by the spec.


This makes sense, we should spec this so that the poster must be visible
until its played, otherwise the poster attribute can't be relied upon by
authors.



 

The poster should show again after the video has ended.
 
I'm ambivalent about this.  I could go either way.


Aesthetically, I feel we shouldn't show the poster once the video has
finished. Authors could script this behaviour if they wanted it. The spec as
it's written forbids showing the poster after a video frame has been shown.




The visibility of the poster should be scriptable and/or controllable using
an attribute. Meaning that one should be able to turn on/off the poster
(without changing the poster attrbute's value)

 
I don't see why this is necessary.


I also don't see why this is necessary. The poster attribute is only useful
if it's enabled, it's not useful if it isn't. Having an attribute to denote
whether the poster attribute is enabled seems like duplication of state to
me.



  You can just do
 
video.dataset.poster = video.poster;
video.removeAttribute(&quot;poster&quot;);
 
to remove it, and
 
video.poster = video.dataset.poster;
 
to restore, if you like.  (In browsers that implement dataset, which
is apparently only WebKit so far.  But you can easily store the
original value someplace else, although not quite as elegantly.)
 


The specification for poster [1] implies that we should handle dynamic
changes to the poster attribute. I can imagine authors may want to cycle
through a chain of poster images for a given video, and this can
(theoretically) be easily implemented by changing the poster attribute in a
timer.
