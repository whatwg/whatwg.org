fwiw, i recently visited a friend who noted that none of their family
recall their gregorian dates. They use a biblical calendar scheme. I
have absoutely no sympathy for them. i've had free apps which handle
this problem for nearly two decades. If you ever enter these dates,
your date will be stored by your browser. and if your browser has
integration to your contacts/calendar, then it could retrieve a
gregorian date from the calendar which might display dates to you in
some other scheme.

this is *not* a reason to have html support the scheme. it is a reason
that browsers should support better integration with other
applications and formats.

we already have bobby tables killing systems. and there is a case of
the cell phone which contributed to a murder for lack of a simple dot
and an eye(i). we do not need people crashing database by sending
formats.

a few hours ago i rejected a caledar invite because it was written
with Finnish words instead of using gregorian numbers. note that the
meeting was probably confidential so i couldn't simply paste the
invite into google translate.

computers are wonderful things, they work really well with a single
standard. and really poorly with too many from which to choose (utf7
attacks, wap content - yes, hotels.com served it to my opera browser).

hotels.com at least, be sure you get the en us non mobile site.
reservations can't be made 100 years in advance, i suppose western
union could do it for Marty, but no one else does, and even they bet
on it. - <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II</A>

most travel sites i deal with like supporting two digit years.
any time you use magic (js) to jump the user's cursor around, things
tend to break. (especially with this browser which drops key presses
anyway).
