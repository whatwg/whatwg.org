Well, serving up data as text/plain for it to be readable is one.  I 
agree that for the specific case of &lt;video&gt; this is not a big deal.

Why are you assuming that?

There are proposals for standardizing several different types of 
sniffing, with the one used being context-dependent.  A proxy wouldn't 
have the context.

It can all be made to work by erring on the side of blocking more stuff, 
but then you get to the point where the proxy makes it impossible to use 
the browser altogether, and then it's not a viable solution to the 
problem at hand.

&gt;<i> Put another way: the problem here is not that browsers sniff.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> that browsers don't behave interoperably or predictably.  Speccing a
</I>&gt;<i> precise sniffing algorithm that everyone's willing to follow allows
</I>&gt;<i> proxies to reliably know what browsers will do with it.  What will
</I>&gt;<i> cause problems is what you seem to be arguing for -- *not* speccing
</I>&gt;<i> sniffing
</I>
Er... Where did I propose this?  I proposed speccing that there MUST NOT 
be any sniffing, with browsers that sniff therefore being nonconformant. 
  I didn't propose allowing ad-hoc sniffing.

&gt;<i> For the use-case of filtering
</I>&gt;<i> exploits, it doesn't really matter what the behavior is, so long as
</I>&gt;<i> it's consistent.
</I>
Only if &quot;consistent&quot; includes &quot;consistent across all contexts&quot;.... 
(which no one is proposing to either specify or implement).
