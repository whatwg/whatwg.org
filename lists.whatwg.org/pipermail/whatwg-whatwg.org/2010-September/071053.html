&gt;<i> tl;dr of my previous post: it's impossible to know how much memory is
</I>&gt;<i> available in the future.
</I>
&gt;<i> How much memory you're currently using is something that /could/
</I>&gt;<i> probably be provided in the near future. *However*, there might be a
</I>&gt;<i> concern that this could be abused by attackers trying to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> information about the host environment. Either way, you'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> wait for browsers to finish exposing this to users before it becomes
</I>&gt;<i> exposed to web applications.
</I>
How about maybe a percentage of Javascript memory used? We could check
if it goes into critical mass (95 %?) to reduce stored things.

Browsers could enlarge said Javascript memory or make it smaller at will.


&gt;<i> As for canvas sizes... The amount of available ram can easily have
</I>&gt;<i> nothing to do with video graphics surface restrictions. This is a
</I>&gt;<i> distinct requirement (thanks for listing it). I think it's probably
</I>&gt;<i> more reasonable for browsers to provide a hint about this than the
</I>&gt;<i> others. Again there are security concerns, and resource race
</I>&gt;<i> conditons. But if the number is clamped and can somehow float, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> it's workable. Keep in mind that there could be 5 windows side by side
</I>&gt;<i> each competing to waste e.g. GL contexts on an overly constrained GL
</I>&gt;<i> based system (the embeddings I'm looking at suck like this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That leaves the &quot;i want to dump data to cache&quot; case, which is covered
</I>&gt;<i> by &quot;use a timer (even Date()) and figure out if things have slowed too
</I>&gt;<i> much. For this case, you should in theory start by playing with
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage and application-cache.
</I>
This gives me an idea. How about if the browser exposed a hint for  
processor
usage. Like &quot;low, medium, high&quot; in context of the Javascript Website.
This means if the processor is at 80 % usage in the OS task manager, it
could still be on &quot;low&quot; for the Javascript application depending on how
much it currently uses. Which means if the Javascript application reaches
&quot;high&quot;, it would certainly become unresponsive.

Another example: The OS processor is at 98 %. the Javascript app uses only
1 % of it, but STILL goes &quot;medium&quot; or even &quot;high&quot; because it uses a lot of
the currently available resources.

At some point there should of course be a limit on how much of the  
processor
it CAN use if it idles.


&gt;<i> Automatically tuning is your user's friend. And it doesn't require any
</I>&gt;<i> new apis :)
