</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I don't see why providing a scriptable API to hide the poster image is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the existing API to clear and show the poster?
</I>&gt;<i>

element.removeAttribute(&quot;poster&quot;)?

As it stands today, the poster is not usable (probably because as you state
&gt;<i> it has not been designed to be independent). Every website that has
</I>&gt;<i> implemented their own Html 5 video player have had to hack their way to get
</I>&gt;<i> things to work the way they&#8217;d expect. I explained this part in my first
</I>&gt;<i> post. Basically ,what they do is assign the poster and not the source. Then
</I>&gt;<i> when the user clicks play, they assign the source. Then each time the user
</I>&gt;<i> skips ahead, they need to null out the poster attribute (otherwise in some
</I>&gt;<i> browsers the poster flashes during buffering periods) and then set the
</I>&gt;<i> currentTime to skip ahead. Now if you want to change the source of the video
</I>&gt;<i> in mid play to a better or lower quality version of the same video then you
</I>&gt;<i> have to go through a few more hoops (and the load() method is used at this
</I>&gt;<i> time &#8211; but you don&#8217;t want the poster to show either).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we have a consensus on the need to change the way the poster
</I>&gt;<i> behaves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.       The poster should remain visible till the video is played.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.       Once the video has been played, the poster should not show during
</I>&gt;<i> buffering  or skipping ahead or any other action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree with all that. Firefox already does what you want there.

 The only thing that remains then is if web developers would like control
&gt;<i> over the poster, such as to show the poster after the video has ended, then
</I>&gt;<i> there should be a way to do that. For this we need a method to show the
</I>&gt;<i> poster once again. Current there is no way to get the poster to show again
</I>&gt;<i> and the load() method is not the answer, nor is resetting. A simple method
</I>&gt;<i> that does not impact anything else will do the trick.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am trying to understand why load() is not an adequate answer.
