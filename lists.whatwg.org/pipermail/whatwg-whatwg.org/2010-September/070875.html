</I>Well, events aren't &quot;declarative&quot;, and you explicitly
asked for progress events ;)



  And so my suggestion...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use case I'm uploading a large file using an iframe. So yes, the
</I>&gt;<i> iframe will be submitted, but the rest of the page is intact. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still left without having the ability to know how long the upload is
</I>&gt;<i> going to take and how it is progressing. So while the form is
</I>&gt;<i> submitting, today we go through quite a bit of hackry to show our
</I>&gt;<i> users progress.
</I>
Uploading the form data or files using XMLHttpRequest isn't
a hack.


&gt;<i> Having the event
</I>Again, event isn't &quot;declarative&quot;. It is all about scripting, in which
case you could just use XMLHttpRequest.


  and information allows us to provide
&gt;<i> a consistent (across browsers) interface which is extremely important
</I>&gt;<i> (as you can imagine) and does not require the server side to support
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>The XHR way doesn't need any special server side handling.



&gt;<i> Currently, we monitor the bytes received on the server side
</I>&gt;<i> (and no web server gives you easy access to this information) and
</I>&gt;<i> make that available (per session) to the client UA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time, if I were to use Flash to upload the file, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> need server side support to show progress and almost every website
</I>&gt;<i> (that deals with large file uploads) today uses Flash to display
</I>&gt;<i> upload progress to their users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do think browser UI for large uploads is terrible and needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree!
</I>
Yeah, the UI is terrible, but that is about browser implementations and
not about any specification.

I'd love to see browsers provide their own information in a
&gt;<i> more noticeable/useful fashion, but I still think surfacing the event
</I>&gt;<i> and information allows web developers the option to display such
</I>&gt;<i> information in a consistent manner (across browsers) without having
</I>&gt;<i> to resort to handling the entire submission process using
</I>&gt;<i> XMLHttpRequest. Chrome in fact does show a percentage in the status
</I>&gt;<i> bar but how many people have noticed? And with todays browser
</I>&gt;<i> trending towards less &quot;chrome&quot; it would mean unless the user has
</I>&gt;<i> turned on the status bar this info will not be visible.
