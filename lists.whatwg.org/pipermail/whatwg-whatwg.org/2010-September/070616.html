</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At first glance, my eyes almost popped out of my sockets when I saw
</I>&gt;<i> this suggestion. &quot;Using the file extension?! He must be mad!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I remembered that our Flash player *has* to use file extension
</I>&gt;<i> since the MIME type isn't available in Flash. Turns out that file
</I>&gt;<i> extension is a pretty good indicator, but it doesn't work for custom
</I>&gt;<i> server configurations where videos don't have extensions, ala YouTube.
</I>&gt;<i> For that reason, we allow users to override whatever we detect with a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;type&quot; configuration parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, the question is, &quot;What are we trying to accomplish?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we're trying to make it easy for content creators to guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> that their content is available to all viewers regardless of their
</I>&gt;<i> browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If that's the case, I'd actually suggest that the browsers *strictly*
</I>&gt;<i> follow the MIME type, with the &lt;source&gt; type as a override, and
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating all sniffing (assuming that the file container format
</I>&gt;<i> contains the codec meta-data). If a publisher notices that their video
</I>&gt;<i> isn't working, they can either update their server's MIME type
</I>&gt;<i> mapping, or just hard code the type in the HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  Hard coding the type is only possible if the element uses a &lt;source&gt; element, @type isn't allowed on &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt;.

&gt;<i> Neither is that time consuming / difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>  It isn't hard to update a server if you control it, but it can be *very* difficult and time consuming if you don't (as is the case with most web developers, I assume).


&gt;<i> Moreover, as Adrian suggested, it's probably quite easy to get the big
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP servers (Apache, IIS, nginx, lighttpd) to add the new extensions
</I>&gt;<i> (if they haven't already), so this would gradually become less and
</I>&gt;<i> less of an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>  Really? Your company specializes in web video and flv files have been around for years, but your own server still isn't configured for it:

eric% curl -I &quot;<A HREF="http://content.longtailvideo.com/videos/flvplayer.flv">http://content.longtailvideo.com/videos/flvplayer.flv</A>&quot;
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
