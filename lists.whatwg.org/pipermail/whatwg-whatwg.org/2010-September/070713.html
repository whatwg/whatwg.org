Gecko behavior for lineTo and most other canvas methods I see has been 
to throw since late 2006, and shipped with the initial release of 
Firefox 3.0.  At the time, the change was also backported to the Firefox 
1.5 and Firefox 2 branches.

Well, except that leads to incorrect rendering, as I said.  Was this 
discussion public, perchance?
