</I>
Okay, okay, I'll try to avoid stating assumptions like that, at least
about people on the list.  :)  So never mind that point.  (Although I
was mostly thinking of IE, not Chrome and certainly not Safari.)  I
think sniffing is a good idea even if we could get everyone to agree
not to sniff.

&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; Okay, you're being too theoretical for me. &#160;Let's say we have

</I>
Either context-independent, or specified to occur only in certain key
contexts like &lt;video&gt;/top-level browsing context.  No browser
implements my suggested behavior today, but I think we all agree it's
confusing/harmful to only sniff for &lt;video&gt; and not top-level browsing
contexts too, because it breaks all sorts of expected behavior (open
in new tab, copy video URL, etc.).

&gt;<i> Is this a reasonable supposition? &#160;What are these byte sequences for the
</I>&gt;<i> container formats at hand? &#160;(Say WebM's restricted Matroska container,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever container format is supported for H.264 by IE and Chrome, and Ogg;
</I>&gt;<i> we'll ignore the generic Matroska weirdness for now.)
</I>
I don't know, which is why I'm considering a hypothetical.  If someone
who knows better could step up with this piece of info, that would be
helpful.

&gt;<i> Might be a good idea to ask the IE team, the Chrome team, and the Safari
</I>&gt;<i> team why they're not sniffing in toplevel browsing contexts... &#160;I believe
</I>&gt;<i> there's been at least one answer from a Chrome developer on that already,
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
That would also be helpful information.  Andrew Scherkus made it sound
like Chrome wouldn't necessarily object to sniffing on top-level
browsing contexts, just that it would have to be sandboxed (although
I'm not sure why).

&gt;<i> Sure, but it's early days in implementation. &#160;Note, also, that I believe
</I>&gt;<i> it's 3 browsers, not 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> . . .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of these changes take time (e.g. having to rejigger quicktime to allow
</I>&gt;<i> you to no sniff while using it). &#160;So is it that they have not changed, or
</I>&gt;<i> that they have no plans to change, ever?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> . . .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such changes have happened in the past (e.g. for stylesheets, and for
</I>&gt;<i> toplevel browsing contexts). &#160;Why is this case different?
</I>
Okay, so maybe I'm too pessimistic.  :)  Regardless of this point, I
still think sniffing consistently is the best solution, *if* it can be
done reliably -- i.e., given the assumptions I gave in my sketch of a
proposal (easily-checked fingerprints that make text matches
impossible and binary matches of negligible likelihood).  If those
assumptions hold, would you agree that consistently sniffing is a
better idea than honoring clearly incorrect MIME types, assuming we
could get implementers to agree one way or the other?  If not, why
not?  I don't see significant downsides, and the upside of actually
being able to have stuff work without configuring MIME types seems
big.
