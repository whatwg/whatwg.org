IE9, Safari and Chrome ignore Content-Type in a &lt;video&gt; context and rely  
on sniffing. If you want Content-Type to be respected, convince the  
developers of those 3 browsers to change. If not, it's quite inevitable  
that Opera and Firefox will eventually have to follow.

&gt;<i> For reasons already argued about here, you will never make the results

</I>
Unless all browsers agree to respect Content-Type, the next best thing is  
to agree on the same sniffing. Why would leaving it undefined be better?

&gt;<i> The typing mechanism of the web (and more) is Content-Type, period.
</I>
Only in theory. In practice, Content-Type is an unreliable indicator of  
the type of a resource. Sniffing is already part of the web architecture,  
with all its problems.

&gt;<i> (*: or, the traditional reason for sniffing, `text/plain`, due to Apache  
</I>&gt;<i> inappropriately sending this type for unknown files by default, bug  
</I>&gt;<i> 13986. That doesn't seem to apply here.)
</I>
It hasn't been explicitly stated, but I assume that the only cases where  
sniffing for video formats would be employed would be for missing  
Content-Type, text/plain and application/octet-stream.
