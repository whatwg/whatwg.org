</I>
I'm not an audio/video format expert; I have no idea.  Does it matter?

&gt;<i> If the author does deliberately craft the file, is there
</I>&gt;<i> any security risk in displaying it unexpectedly, given that media
</I>&gt;<i> isn't scriptable?
</I>
Yes; media codecs (including image decoders) are one of the most common 
sources or remote attacks on operating systems via web browsers.  So 
showing some image or video is always a risk.  If you have a known 
unpatched vulnerability and try to defend against it by blocking the 
relevant content, then sniffing can defeat the block, leading to exploits.

Note that this means that only people/organizations that are proactive 
about their security will have their vulnerability window made bigger by 
sniffing; everyone else is already screwed in the above situation no 
matter whether browsers sniff.

&gt;<i> As long as what the browser is doing is almost certain to be closer to
</I>&gt;<i> the author's/user's/webmaster's intent, that's not a problem.
</I>
Why is it not a problem if there are suddenly use cases that are 
impossible because the browser will ignore the author's intent?

&gt;<i> Sniffing is a problem if you risk false positives or security issues,
</I>
That's one case where it's a problem, yes.

&gt;<i> but I can't see how that's an issue in this specific case.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> have any issues ever been caused by this kind of sniffing problem?
</I>
As far as I know, yes (of the &quot;remotely take control of the computer&quot; kind).

&gt;<i> Are there clear problems that have arisen in other cases?
</I>
See above.

 &gt; The problem can't plausibly arise with media
&gt;<i> files -- if you can execute a vulnerability via getting the user to
</I>&gt;<i> view a media file, it's probably via arbitrary code execution.  In
</I>&gt;<i> that case you don't need to disguise yourself, just get the viewer to
</I>&gt;<i> go to your own website and do whatever you want, since there are no
</I>&gt;<i> same-domain restrictions.
</I>
See above about people who take steps to protect themselves when 
problems like this arise and would be screwed over by sniffing.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, actually, if there's a filtering proxy trying to screen out video or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image data that's trying to exploit known OS-level bugs, say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like such a proxy would be unreliable in any event, since you
</I>&gt;<i> could do all sorts of things to obfuscate it, not least of all just
</I>&gt;<i> using HTTPS.
</I>
There's no reason such a proxy couldn't block https (and it has to, to 
work correctly, as you point out).

&gt;<i> Do any such proxies exist?
</I>
In the past, yes.  I haven't checked in the last year or two.

</I>
See above about not sneaking dangerous file formats past filtering software.
