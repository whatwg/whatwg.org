It's already supported (pretty much) if you do the form submission in
JavaScript via XMLHttpRequest, in browsers that support all the shiny
new standards.  You can get the file from &lt;input type=file&gt; via a File
API, submit it via XHR, and get progress events from that.  I don't
think it makes much sense to provide events to script while a file is
being uploaded by the browser via a standard form submit.  At that
point, the user is already in the process of navigating away from the
page.

I do think browser UI for large uploads is terrible and needs to be
fixed.  For large uploads, they should display a prominent upload bar
(comparable in prominence to their display for downloads), and not let
the user navigate away without explicitly canceling the upload.  But
this is a question of UI, not HTML.
