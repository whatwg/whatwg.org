Hmm... voddler is not available in my country. :( Any other examples? I'm
really trying to understand the use case here.



&gt;<i> Can you give me a good reason/case for not having a simple method (with no

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I can see the use case for when the video is finished and &quot;rewinds&quot; to the
start, and I can see a means to address that without having more attributes.

But I cannot see the need for having it mid-video on pause. In fact, I would
regard that as pretty poor user interface design actually because you would
be seeing the representative poster rather than the current video frame,
giving you no indication whatsoever where in the video you currently are.
Often when people pause a video they do that to check out what is going on
in these frames, e.g. to read some text that is in the frame. Replacing that
context frame with a poster makes no sense to me and actually reduces
usability. It's particularly bad for people who may need longer to grasp
some visual content in the scene than your average user, so it also
negatively influences accessibility. I haven't seen a case yet that speaks
for having this feature, but I can already come up with two good reasons for
not having that feature.

Regards,
Silvia.
