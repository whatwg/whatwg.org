<PRE>&gt;<i>A side question: do any of these sites want a poster that has dynamic/interactive content in it?
</I>


They have video pre-roll ads but then that&#8217;s just another video. Honestly, I can&#8217;t speak for other websites (besides seeing what I see and know). At ExposureRoom we don&#8217;t have any distractions from the video. No ads in the video and one text ad to the right hand side of the page. No animated ads anywhere on any page on the site.

 

There is more money is pre-roll video ads then there is for animations and more money in animated ads than for static image ads. So video sites may just go down the route of video ads. I know there are large businesses that cater to all your needs for pre-roll ads.

Here are some contradictory cases that may serve as use cases to justify the need to have a spate method: 

1.       Some websites, don&#8217;t bother showing the poster after the video ends while providing the content producer to override.

2.       Some websites (and mobile devices) default to showing the poster after the video ends and allowing the content producer to override

3.       Some websites show the poster whenever the video is paused.

 

Given the above cases, having a method the specifically controls the visibility of the poster (alone) will allow all of the above cases to be implemented.

 

A side question: do any of these sites want a poster that has dynamic/interactive content in it?
