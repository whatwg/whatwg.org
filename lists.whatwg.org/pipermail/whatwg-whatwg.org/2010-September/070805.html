</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         event.initMouseEvent(type, canBubble, cancelable, view,

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> event.initEvent(type, bubbles, cancelable, relatedTarget); 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of a mouse event, this would be equivalent to 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         event.initMouseEvent(type, canBubble, cancelable, view, 
</I>&gt;<i>             detail, screenX, screenY, clientX, clientY, 
</I>&gt;<i>             ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey, metaKey, 
</I>&gt;<i>             button, relatedTarget); 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where the additional arguments have their actual current values.

I'm not entirely sure that this is possible. As far as I know (and I
could be very wrong) the events start with the OS and work their way
down the system to eventually reach the Javascript through a user agent,
so if the mouse has moved off of the user agent (browser) then it may
not be possible to access the current coordinates. The browser would
only be aware of the coordinates that it was last passed by the OS, i.e.
only those in it's own window space. A browser could offer up the last
known coordinates, but if the cursor is beyond the region of a browser
window for example, then the browser would be passing across the wrong
values. This might not matter for most cases, but then again, I can't
foresee much use for having the coordinates of a cursor that triggered
no event. The only time a user agent might be aware of the correct
coordinates and no event would be triggered would be where the cursor
was over part of the user agent that wasn't the web page, like the
menubar, etc.

Thanks,
Ash
