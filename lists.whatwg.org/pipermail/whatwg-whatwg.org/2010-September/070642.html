I may be going slightly off topic with this, but in relation to sniffing 
and the issue around that,
there actually is a long term solution that could be used.
Any program would only need to sniff the first 265 bytes of any file to 
know what format it is.
I created a rough draft of an idea I had that I called BINID:

***********************************************************

Default TLA extension = .bin
Default Mimetype = application/octet-stream

Binary Header/Octet-Stream Header/Binary ID Wrapper:

The header is almost identical to the PNG one.

The first eight bytes of a BIN file always contain the following values:

    (decimal)              137  66  73  78  13  10  26  10
    (hexadecimal)           89  42  49  4e  0d  0a  1a  0a
    (ASCII C notation)    \211   B   I   N  \r  \n \032 \n

This signature both identifies the file as a BIN file and provides for 
immediate detection
of common file-transfer problems. The first two bytes distinguish BIN 
files on systems that
expect the first two bytes to identify the file type uniquely. The first 
byte is chosen as
a non-ASCII value to reduce the probability that a text file may be 
miss-recognized as a BIN file;
also, it catches bad file transfers that clear bit 7. Bytes two through 
four name the format.
The CR-LF sequence catches bad file transfers that alter newline 
sequences. The control-Z
character stops file display under MS-DOS. The final line feed checks 
for the inverse of the
CR-LF translation problem.

After the 8 byte BINID header the following/next 1 byte indicate the 
length (0-255) of the text string that follows.
The text string is always zero terminated. (so it is actually length+1)
So please note that if the byte states 255 as length that it is actually
a textual length of 255 chars + zero terminator.
The string is UTF-8.

To clarify some more:
\211 B I N \r \n \032 \n \008 F i l e t y p e \000
BINID header (8bytes), stringlength (1 byte), filetype (8 bytes in this 
example), zeroterminator/null (1 byte).

The text string is the name of the actual format contents.
This was chosen instead of using 4byte/32bit binary file id,
or relying on file extensions etc. or equally silly methods.
At least this way one probably won't run out of ids etc.
And it's also humanly readable. (the text string)
So any program can just simply show the text string to the user
and state it's unsupported instead of screaming it's an unknown format.

After the zero termination, the actual data starts.
What this data is can be anything, the byte order could be 
Network/Motorola order or Intel order.
it could have it's own sub header indicating file size and checksum etc. 
or it could be raw data.
In fact it could also be another fileformat dumped right in, otherwise 
unchanged.

IMPORTANT! Since the binid is plain text, it's obvious that
&quot;MPEG-1 Layer-3 Audio (MP3)&quot; and &quot;mpeg-1 layer-3 audio (mp3)&quot; are the 
same humanly speaking,
however... To avoid ANY issues or confusions,
when creating and checking/verifying a id string,
ALWAYS treat it as a binary id. i.e basic binary compare.
In other words, typos are NOT acceptable.

The only reason it IS a text string is to avoid using up a limited 32bit 
id field.
To avoid motorola/intel byte order issues with id numbers.
To have something to inform (show) the user in those situations where 
the software
don't support the fileformat. This way it's so easy to inform the user
and they will be able to search on the net or ask the company about the 
file format.
So remember.  &quot;MPEG&quot; and &quot;mpeg&quot; are the exact same, but only ONE of them 
is acceptable.

It is also strongly advised against using version numbers in the id.
Instead try to keep such stuff to the content/data area itself (or the 
wrapped format).

Another interesting thing is that the .bin is not really needed.
You can call it .dat or whatever you want.
If it's a mp3 file you might wanna use this nifty binary header but call 
it .mp3 instead
which might be useful on a human and filesystem sorting level.
Although a modern OS or software should read the
textual binid field and show that instead.

The Binary header is basically a filetype/id header,
stating that this is a binary file. (first 8 bytes header)
and then the filetype/content data id in the form of a nullterminated 
string.
(string length indicated by a single byte right before the string itself)

So if the filetype is &quot;Cool Test File&quot; and is obviously a non existing 
filetype/format.
The filetype name length is 14 bytes.
The string is 0 terminated. so the string is actually 15 bytes in this case.
And thus the entire file format header is 25 bytes in this example.
(BINID header, byte indicating ID length, the UTF-8 filetype name, null 
terminator.)

A mp3 file which itself don't really have a easily identifiable header 
could be just like this example.
Except as filetype it would say &quot;MPEG-1 Layer-3 Audio (MP3)&quot;
and the text length byte would be the value 26 naturally.
And after the 0 termination byte, you would have a typical mp3 file.
So the full BINID header would be 8+1+26+1 for a total of 36 bytes 
before the MP3 begins.

Features/Why You should use it/cool points:
The cool thing with the binary header, is that it truly is fully 
platform independent.
The header is darn short, 8 bytes and then a byte for the binid text 
string size,
so the issue with Motorola and Intel 16bit and 32bit byte orders etc are 
avoided.
The text string binid allow as you saw in the mp3 example above,
a very accurate and descriptive binid. The binid is easily displayed to 
the user
in the case the filetype is unsupported. No more issues hunting down 
obscure formats.
With upto 255 char long binid string, we wont be running out of 
&quot;binid&quot;'s anytime soon (statement that will haunt me?!).
It is named rather neutrally. it's simply BIN actually as you saw earlier.
So your customers won't wonder why &quot;your&quot; fileformat is named after some 
other company etc.
The file extension is almost redundant. But it should at least be .bin
or the actual filetype extension (i.e for a MP3 it would be .mp3) to 
remain familiar to users/compatible.
This fileformat is FREE to use, no licensing needed at all (zlib 
license), there never will be, no patent issues or anything like that.
This format is FROZEN/LOCKED. Meaning it will never change. Ever. It's 
just a top layer binid.

Why:
I was tired of having to MAKE new fileformats myself all the time.
Modifying current ones was not possible as that would break file standards.
Just about all file extensions are used up or overused making things 
confusing sometimes.
(i.e thousands of apps using same extensions for different things))
Unknown filetypes can be a true pain to identify. (&quot;what the heck is a 
.ecf file?&quot; etc...)
looking inside a file using a hex editor doesn't always make you any wiser.
Usually there is either no fileheader/fileid or it's just 4 or 8 bytes 
stating ECF1 or something.
Again a pain to find out what it really is...
The BIN fileid header is inspired by PNG's header, is so easy to 
implement and support.
I'll be using it for ALL my future binary file formats/filetypes,
which includes a file compression/archiver, file encrypter, media 
player, and much more.
Because it's so simple, it's also super flexible. You can easily use 
other container formats inside this one.
An OS could easily support this, even use it for executables and much more.
Actually. this is barely passable for a container format as it's 
basically a tiny static fileid header.
The binary data/file can easily be added/attached to the end of the 
header, with no need to edit the header in any way.
(i.e no crc checksum or size... all that is left to the actual 
filetype/formats themselfs)

just some examples:

&quot;Core Dump (Intel Byte Order)&quot;
&quot;MPEG-1 Layer-3 (MP3)&quot;
&quot;Windows Media Video (WMV)&quot;
&quot;JPEG Image&quot;
ETC.

Yeah! The &quot;description&quot; itself becomes the actual BINID.
Hopefully web browsers will catch on quickly,
as this would allow a fast and easy way to id files that don't have a 
proper mime type.
So in the future a mime type &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; won't be as 
mysterious any longer.

Another advantage I forgot to mention, is that since it's basically a 
file ID &quot;slap on&quot; header,
it is so easy to add it on the fly. I.e a webserver could even add it to 
the start of a file/stream
that is sent to the browsers in case the file don't originally have a 
BIN header...

***********************************************************

I really should re-write it all as it's kind of messy, an early draft as 
I said,
and was first scribbled down over half a decade ago, but the BINID 
standard is solid enough,
and I'm coding in support for it (and using it) in some upcoming 
projects as well as all future ones.

Some form of central registry would be needed though where new strings 
could be registered, looked up/searched/listed etc.
Software would not need to contact such a registry in any way, as I 
mentioned above the BINID itself tells you what it is,
so if you software does not support the filetype you can just show it to 
the user or even send them to Google or Bing or Yahoo to query the format,
or a official registry lookup if such is available for direct queries 
like that.
For now, &quot;I'm&quot; that registry, but ideally it should be some independent 
non-profit organization of some sort that should maintain it.
There is no online database to browse yet either, but one is planned and 
will be available on EmSai.net but I'm also pondering the idea of 
hosting elsewhere.
