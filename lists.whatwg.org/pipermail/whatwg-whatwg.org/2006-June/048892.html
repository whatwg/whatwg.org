</I>
What i meant was to use &lt;root&gt;3&lt;of&gt;125&lt;/root&gt; as a shorthand notation for something like &lt;root&gt;&lt;order&gt;3&lt;/order&gt;&lt;of&gt;125&lt;/of&gt;&lt;/root&gt;, in which case only the actual element names differ from the current proposal.

&gt;&gt;<i>3) Assure compatibility with a reasonable subset of TeX
</I>
&gt;<i>absence of a model for prescripts is one of most important flaws in TeX,
</I>&gt;<i>therefore do not wait that a TeX input can be magically transformed into HTML 5.
</I>
Obviously, it will not be possible to transform any TeX code into HTML 5.

Something like ${}^aB$ could be transformed into an HTML 5 prescript given the correct rules, but then something like ${}^{342}_4X$ would of course look different in TeX (probably incorrect) and HTML 5.

&gt;&gt;<i>4) Make font selection simple and natural
</I>
&gt;<i>There is many options. In HTML roman font is default and one just markes
</I>&gt;<i>variables as when one uses &lt;i&gt; for italic font. In Elsevier DTD for math,
</I>&gt;<i>italic was the default and roman was marked via tag.
</I>
Very well, but then a choice must be made.

&gt;<i>I do not think that automatic mixing of roman and italic would be a good
</I>&gt;<i>idea at the browser side if one search a rapid cheap implementation fully
</I>&gt;<i>compatible with current standards.
</I>
That is probably quite right.

&gt;<i>However, this would be not a problem for authors, because one could
</I>&gt;<i>implement a small js in a week that authors could use in their computers
</I>&gt;<i>asisting them to authoring math.
</I>
Such a script would certainly not fit everyone's needs and desires. It could be potentially useful to many, but the language should be such that hand-authoring be practical -- otherwise, the perfect integration with HTML will be lost.

&gt;&gt;<i>How are non-italic variables supposed to be handled? Using attributes,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>like &lt;var class=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;, &lt;var class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;, &lt;var
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>class=&quot;blackletter&quot;&gt;, &lt;var class=&quot;roman&quot;&gt;, etc. may be part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>solution, even though it would be quite verbose.
</I>
&gt;<i>HTML is more verbose than TeX but is less erratic.
</I>
That is a fair point.

&gt;<i>I think that people can perfectly use
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;var class=&quot;vector&quot;&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>instead
</I>&gt;<i>\mathbf{F}
</I>&gt;<i>if you dislike the class attribute, then try something like
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;var&gt;&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
</I>
A few issues still remain to be solved, though:

Boldface does not necessarily mean vector, and vectors are not always printed in bold type. Presumably, you mean that classes like `vector' need not be defined in the specification, that the choice is up to the author, and that a custom CSS style-sheet can be used to define the font. (This would require CSS font-families for Fraktur and double-struck/blackboard bold.)

This approach would entail introducing semantic or quasi-semantic mark-up to encode an important part of a formula's visual appearance. Obviously, LaTeX commands like \mathcal and \mathbb indicate no semantics, so the only sensible solution would be to transform this into something like &lt;var class=&quot;cal&quot;&gt; and &lt;var class=&quot;bb&quot;&gt;. If this is going to happen, the classes should probably be defined in the specification.

The re-use of &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; makes sense in a way, but these two tags do not suffice to access all the different fonts. (Unicode report [1] lists 14 alphabets: roman, italic, script, Fraktur, sans-serif upright, sans-serif slanted; bold versions of all these; double-struck and monospace.)
    [1] <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/</A>
It is not clear that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) would be a good choice for bold italic variable names, as it would lead to encoding e.g. &lt;i&gt;a &lt;/b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (could be a vector b scaled by a factor a), whereas something more like &lt;i&gt;a&lt;i&gt; &lt;bi&gt;b&lt;/bi&gt; would be wanted. Another possibility would be to use something like &lt;var i&gt;a&lt;/var&gt; &lt;var b i&gt;b&lt;/var&gt;.

Each approach has its problems. Anyway, the specification should probably not try to avoid the issue of font selection.
