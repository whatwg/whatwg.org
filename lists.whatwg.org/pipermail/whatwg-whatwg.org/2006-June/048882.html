&gt;<i> LaTeX is *not* the preferred format for submissions in Physical Review

 From their guidelines for authors [1]:

&quot;Acceptable formats for the discount or waiver are currently REVTeX (preferred), 
LaTeX, Harvmac, Plain TeX, or MSWord&quot;

 From the REVTeX page:
&quot;The following design principles were incorporated into REVTeX 4:

     * Make REVTeX fully compatible with LaTeX2e.&quot;

So I presume you are misinformed or I am looking in the wrong place. (Note for 
the interested: harvmac seems to be another TeX dialect, so all the acceptable 
hand-authored formats are TeX-based)

&gt;<i> That TeX-LaTeX is not
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient for the web is also recogined even by TeX gurus as David
</I>&gt;<i> Carlisle [1].
</I>
Note that I have never advocated putting TeX directly on the web. I'm merely 
stating that simple conversion from LaTeX will be an important feature of any 
successful format.

&gt;<i> Do you know that LaTeX3 is moving towards SGML/HTML model of publications
</I>&gt;<i> in some aspects?
</I>
Excellent. Maybe if people move to LaTeX 3 for their offline work, it will be 
easier to get maths online. (Side note: HTML is not SGML and has not been since 
at least the Netscape 3 days). I certainly don't have any issue if LaTeX can 
meet HTML half way, allowing people to take small steps toward mathematics on 
the web rather than the &quot;one giant leap&quot; that you propose.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some weeks ago I received a draft of manuscript prepared by a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mathematician and will probably be published in MSOR journal in brief.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> He is not using TeX or LateX because limitations and write:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Mathematicians have been served well by TeX and LaTeX for their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mathematical typesetting. Too well, perhaps. At least, if an dedicated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> TeXnician of the last

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world of TeX.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why should I listen to this person?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> End of debate. Why would I pay attention you?
</I>
As far as I can tell, you don't. But, irrespective of that, it's an honest 
question. Just citing anonymous sources doesn't make for a credible argument. 
Why is this person's opinion so worthwhile that you quoted him at me? What are 
these ways? It's not a helpful contribution to the discussion.
