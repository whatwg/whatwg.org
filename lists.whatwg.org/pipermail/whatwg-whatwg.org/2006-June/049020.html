I mean, once you cheaply implement the generic construct

&lt;content-tag&gt;
&lt;tag1&gt;aaaa&lt;/tag1&gt;
&lt;tag2&gt;bbbb&lt;/tag2&gt;
&lt;/content-tag&gt;

for fractions in HTML5 as appears that all of us here achieve consensus
(including one from Mozilla Team) the implementation of the *same*
construct for sup-sub and under-over is trivial since only real changes
are on the stylesheet rules (e.g. no line for tag1 etc.), and could be
done if developers and authors agree. I would find it good.

I assume that authors agree. Therefore, now is matter for developers, they
have the last word.

and even with so one tiny implementation, rendering could be improved
easily. For instance using a % vertical align rule firefox 1.0 is able to
render fractions also with denominators of arbitrary size including nested
fractions as that in the MathML test suite.

Then you are not reading this mailing list during last weeks since
rendering problems remain even using special fonts in Mozilla.

No. Many people is displaying math without MathML and find it *nice*. Ugly
is a subjective word. Moreover, wait a few days until I can update
canonical science today and participate in the game. If CSS approach looks
so ugly you would be able to differentiate formulas constructed via CSS
and via MathML, no?

</I>&gt;<i> Developers? Gecko is already well past zero with MathML.
</I>
A Mozilla guy has expressed interest in this approach. Developers from
MSIE and Opera may prefer (I suspect) &#147;another couple of CSS rules rather
than begin from zero with a unfriendly spec (MathML)&#148;.

&gt;&gt;<i> specially in next Tim Bray semantic web,

</I>
Yes I did, even if Tim Bray is also evagelizing about RDF and all that stuff.
