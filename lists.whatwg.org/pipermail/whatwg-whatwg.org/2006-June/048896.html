It would read

Therefore &quot;official&quot; reply from w3c of Microsoft is not interested in math
because small number of users is a myth

because was not official in the sense of public manifesto but said in
several media and mailing list by some people, including authors from the
w3c.


I presented here links to MathML test suites are passed by George CSS
technique but are not passed by browser with native MathML support
(Firefox 1.0).

Would i provide snapshoots of that my native MathML browser is able to
render and that he would render?

I also have heard that CSS cannot provide rendering quality of MathML but
never see a serious study on that (just personal beliefs). I find curious
that even MathML authors recognize the need to substitute p-MathML
capabilities by CSS (this already was done in 2nd version of MathML) look
one of MathML guys said. However, here some people claim that CSS is not
great enough.

I would be glad to do an experiment on this, i would provide two rendering
copies of mathematical fragments and people would say that is being
generated with MathML and that via George CSS techniques.

Of course, via some CSS extensions all would be still better.
