Math.random() in the way it is defined (without parameters) simply *cannot 
work
without side effects*.  By design. If ECMA Spec. says otherwise it is an 
error in the spec.
This is the whole point.  Dixi. Dot. Tochka.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solving the termination problem is not the point here. Whether a script

</I>&gt;<i> is another property. This thread is about the former. Scripts that don't 
</I>&gt;<i> terminate can be bad for security, too, but they should be dealt with by 
</I>&gt;<i> imposing an execution time limit, and this is not relevant here.
</I>
Reformulate it as:

&quot;Given a description of a program and its initial input,
determine whether the program, when executed on this input,
ever changes the world.  The alternative is that it runs without
changing the world&quot;

Consequence of &quot;halting problem&quot; is a Rice's theorem:
it states that only trivial properties of programs are algorithmically 
decidable.
&quot;No side effects&quot; is not a trivial property.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Whether Math.random() should be considered safe for side effects free
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scripts or not is an arguable question. There is no danger in allowing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Math.random() in CSS expression() from the security standpoint. But at 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> same time allowing Math.random() means that it's possible that the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> script
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> returns different values each time invoked, which makes the life of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> layout engine harder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even worse: if you have some third party code between Math.random()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invocations in your code then you may get the same number each time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To guarantee the same result each time is another requirement, and it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not necessary to fulfil it. In the end, right now there are no guarantees 
</I>&gt;<i> about the scripts, and wouldn't it be better if it could be guaranteed 
</I>&gt;<i> that a CSS expresssion() doesn't steal cookies at least?
</I>
Real example:  RegExp.source in IE is a static property. I think I don't 
need to
explain how to steal cookies if I know that  regexp was used for analyzing 
them
at some point.

So answer is &quot;no&quot; on this:
&quot;if it could be guaranteed that a CSS expresssion() doesn't steal cookies at 
least&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only feasible solution when you can guarantee something is to run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts in sandbox but this involves creation of brand new scripting VM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (memory space, set of globals, etc.) each time you need to evaluate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formula.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is the whole point of script security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can guarantee that a script doesn't steal cookies if it's forced to be 
</I>&gt;<i> side effects free according to my definition. There's no other thing that 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to guarantee by this security measure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is the purpose of the expression() there, btw? :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of expression(), as implemented by IE, is to allow authors to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide procedural implementation of the layout logic that the browser's 
</I>&gt;<i> layout engine lacks. A simple example would be painting odd rows of a 
</I>&gt;<i> table in one color and the even rows in another. Or highlighting cells 
</I>&gt;<i> which contain negative values. Of course, those things that can be 
</I>&gt;<i> expressed declaratively using CSS should be expressed as such, but there 
</I>&gt;<i> will always be use cases beyound the current CSS. I think that declaring 
</I>&gt;<i> alternating row colors with expression() is better than assigning them 
</I>&gt;<i> alternating classes because these classes would be just &quot;hooks&quot; for CSS, 
</I>&gt;<i> having no semantic value. And it plays better with dynamic tables which 
</I>&gt;<i> allow rows to be inserted and removed.
</I>
&quot;cases beyound the current CSS&quot; is a motivation to create better CSS but not 
to invent design
struts. IMHO.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that CSS expression() is a good thing, and I would really love it 
</I>&gt;<i> to be standardized. But as it's implemented in IE today, it's insecure. My 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal would allow to make it safe enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OT:
I've proposed two years ago flex units in CSS (aka %%).:

Two years of use prooved - they are extremely useful.
