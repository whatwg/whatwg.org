Ok, so let's comment. First I'd say I like the path you've taken. I  
like the fact that you make it easy to author formulas directly in HTML.

One thing I dislike however is the distinction you makes between the  
&lt;formula&gt; and the &lt;dformula&gt; elements, which I'd think is confusing.  
Sometimes, formulas are alone on their line but still in the middle  
of a sentence. That formula should have &quot;display: block&quot; with CSS but  
still be considered as an inline element form the HTML point of view  
(so it can be put in a paragraph). At other times, formulas are  
inserted outside paragraphs, as an HTML block. I think it would be  
better to have only one &lt;formula&gt; element which would be a structured  
inline-level element[1].

I would also use &lt;f&gt; instead of &lt;formula&gt; (as Juan used in one of his  
example), because it's shorter and fits well with many other wildly  
used container elements: &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;,  
&lt;dt&gt;, and &lt;dd&gt;.

And I'm somewhat skeptical of the usage you plan for the formula  
group element. Is there a case where placing formulas one after the  
other would be inappropriate?

Fractions: seems all fine to me. Maybe we could use &lt;frac&gt; instead of  
&lt;fraction&gt; (just like we have &lt;div&gt;, &lt;ins&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, &lt;em&gt;), but it's  
not all that important.

Nothing to say about radicals: it's well put.

Under scripts and under braces, over scripts and over braces: Is it  
useful to have distinct &lt;ubase&gt; and &lt;obase&gt;? And the whole concept  
reminds of the Ruby Annotation module of XHTML 1.1 [2] and Ruby in  
CSS 3 [3]. Maybe some parts of that model could be reused. Maybe we  
could even add Ruby (or a derivative of it) to HTML 5 and use it in  
formulas and elsewhere.
