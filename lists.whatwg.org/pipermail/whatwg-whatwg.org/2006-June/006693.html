Yes, but the size is not intended to vary as a function of what follow the operator, is it?

Column vectors and perhaps even binomial coefficients can be regarded as a special kind of matrices; still, it is not necessarily a bad idea to provide specific mark-up for these.

My main concern is that we should not make arbitrary limitations. Sometimes, different vector-like entities are actually distinguished by their delimiters, as are e.g. a matrix, a determinant and a matrix norm.

&gt;<i>Some of ISO-12083 constructs that can not be encoded in MathML either.
</I>
Some of which probably should be added to MathML, but that is another issue.

&gt;&gt;<i>font-family:[cursive] seems like a natural fallback mechanism for script. 
</I>
&gt;<i>Ok. But are Fraktur and caligraphic fonts actually marked as such?
</I>&gt;<i>How browser will identify them?
</I>
As far as I know, no standard mechanism exists to indicate font classification. It is up to the browser to find (or let the user choose) appropriate fonts to use for general font-families like serif and cursive.

&gt;&gt;<i>I tend to believe that a few `unsupported' constructions should be included

</I>
&gt;<i>I would prefer not to include them explicitly. For example ISO-12083 allows any
</I>&gt;<i>character as delimiter but of course not any charcater makes sense and not any
</I>&gt;<i>characters is stretched by ISO 12083 implementations.
</I>
That is a good point. Without any restrictions, the only possible complete implementation would probably be one that deforms the characters used as delimiters in order that they fit into a rectangular shape of a pre-defined ratio. And if we limit the choice, the problem is to avoid `unnecessary' limitations.

The current proposal does not seem to include the following elements of ISO-12083:
    - &lt;overline&gt; and &lt;undrline&gt; [sic] (could be useful - feasible in CSS?)
    - &lt;fence&gt; with arbitrary delimiters (possibly not a good idea)
    - &lt;box&gt; (unnecessary?)
    - labelled arrows &lt;subform&gt; (what is this?)
    - spacing (intended to be handled without explicit mark-up)
    - character transformation _elements_ (fonts intended to be handled via Unicode or CSS)

A few other constructs have been omitted or modified, but without loss of expressive power, e.g. &lt;post&gt; is probably better encoded as &lt;fence&gt; with one empty delimiter as this allows the correct size to be found.

Is anything else missing? How well does presentational MathML cover ISO-12083?
