&gt;<i> One thing I dislike however is the distinction you makes between the

</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes, formulas are alone on their line but still in the middle  
</I>&gt;<i> of a sentence. That formula should have &quot;display: block&quot; with CSS but  
</I>&gt;<i> still be considered as an inline element form the HTML point of view  
</I>&gt;<i> (so it can be put in a paragraph). At other times, formulas are  
</I>&gt;<i> inserted outside paragraphs, as an HTML block. I think it would be  
</I>&gt;<i> better to have only one &lt;formula&gt; element which would be a structured  
</I>&gt;<i> inline-level element[1].
</I>It is comon practice in LaTeX, ISO 12083 and AAP Math DTD to distinguish
inline and block level formulae. Technically it is not a problem to use single element,
but it is less convenient for authoring. Your suggestion is accepatble, but I would prefer
to keep current solution. What others think about  issue?

&gt;<i> I would also use &lt;f&gt; instead of &lt;formula&gt; (as Juan used in one of his  
</I>&gt;<i> example), because it's shorter and fits well with many other wildly  
</I>&gt;<i> used container elements: &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;,  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dt&gt;, and &lt;dd&gt;.
</I>Makes sense. In proposal we used ISO 12083 naming conventions, but it is open issue and
if majority prefer shorter element names that &quot;f&quot; anf &quot;df&quot; for formulae can be used 
(and were used for example in AAP Math and Elsevier Math DTDs).

&gt;<i> And I'm somewhat skeptical of the usage you plan for the formula  
</I>&gt;<i> group element. 
</I>Currently it is rarely used, but still may be useful when why needs to mark
system of equations, with individual equations being marked using &quot;dformula&quot; container
&gt;<i> Is there a case where placing formulas one after the  
</I>&gt;<i> other would be inappropriate?
</I>No.

&gt;<i> Fractions: seems all fine to me. Maybe we could use &lt;frac&gt; instead of  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;fraction&gt; (just like we have &lt;div&gt;, &lt;ins&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, &lt;em&gt;), but it's  
</I>&gt;<i> not all that important.
</I>Maybe. If majority prefer &quot;frac&quot; let it be so.

&gt;<i> Under scripts and under braces, over scripts and over braces: Is it  
</I>&gt;<i> useful to have distinct &lt;ubase&gt; and &lt;obase&gt;? 
</I>Basically it is useless. One notation may be used for both.
&gt;<i> And the whole concept  
</I>&gt;<i> reminds of the Ruby Annotation module of XHTML 1.1 [2] and Ruby in  
</I>&gt;<i> CSS 3 [3]. 
</I>Apart of the fact that Ruby can not be nested (Ruby inside Ruby is not allowed)
and can not be rendered using CSS2.1 (appropriate CSS3 module is required).

&gt;<i> Maybe some parts of that model could be reused. Maybe we  
</I>&gt;<i> could even add Ruby (or a derivative of it) to HTML 5 and use it in  
</I>&gt;<i> formulas and elsewhere.
</I>No due to nesting limitations and CSS related issues mentioned above.
