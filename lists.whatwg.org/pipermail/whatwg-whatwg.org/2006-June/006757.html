Probably it is better to improve presentational layer, but what we have today 
took about ten years, waiting ten years more until CSS will be improved 
to address math needs and implemented in browsers is too much.

&gt;<i> And that's why I was asking for better support, not design
</I>
Yes support for combining diacritical marks would be nice.


&gt;<i> 2. This isn't going to work correctly when the subscripts and  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; superscripts are complex (e.g. fractions). In your proposal,  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they'll fail to stack and will go one after another. What should

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're right, that's a pretty valid criticism that I haven't thought  
</I>&gt;<i> about. But if I bring back my third point suggesting new values for  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vertical-align&quot; based on the preceding character's or element's  
</I>&gt;<i> height, we could arrange the meaning of such values as to make  
</I>&gt;<i> vertical overlap impossible.
</I>
Adding CSS extensions makes sense, but I fear it could take infinite time,
therefore it is better to keep markup within XML/CSS2.1 framework so we could
start using it today and then gradually improve situations on CSS side.
