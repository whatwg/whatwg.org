</I>
I agree. However, in quirks mode this is a requirement. So if we make the 
parsing quirks-compatible (as in, if we remove DOCTYPE-switching for 
parsing), we have no choice.


&gt;<i> &gt; The following is considered one script block (!):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      &lt;script&gt;&lt;!-- document.write('&lt;/script&gt;'); --&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This one is common, I think, and applies to IE6, Safari and Opera even 
</I>&gt;<i> in Standards Mode. Script parsing seems to work like this in Mozilla in 
</I>&gt;<i> Quirks Mode:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If the parser hits the string &quot;&lt;!--&quot; then set a flag to ignore &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> tags.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If the parser then hits the string &quot;--&gt;&quot; then reset the flag.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The flag can only be set once.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. If the parser hits EOF, then reset the flag (if it is set) and reparse the
</I>&gt;<i> script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Opera seems to do the same as Mozilla.
</I>
Anything that depends on EOF is a bad idea for security reasons, so I 
would be reluctant to do that...

&gt;<i> We would have to drop reparsing though.
</I>
...which you seem to agree with. :-)


&gt;<i> I've tried to figure out exactly what IE does, but I have failed. It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to do reparsing sometimes, and others not, and --&gt; after the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt; tag makes a difference, and also whether there are characters 
</I>&gt;<i> after the --&gt; (before EOF). The flag can also be set more than once.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Safari seems to do pretty much what IE does.
</I>
Can't spec what I can't describe! :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/br&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; do magical things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess those magical things are that &lt;/br&gt; is treated as &lt;br&gt;, and that &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> is treated as &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;? If so, then that seems more or less harmless.
</I>
Yeah.


&gt;<i> &gt; p can contain table
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this might be a good thing. I would also like p to be able to contain
</I>&gt;<i> other struct-inline elements, but perhaps that isn't really possible.
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> &gt; Safari and IE have special parsing rules for &lt;% ... %&gt; (even in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standards mode, though clearly this should be quirks-only).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This wouldn't be a bogus comment, as bogus comments end with &gt; (while 
</I>&gt;<i> these end with %&gt;), but I think it would be possible to add this if we 
</I>&gt;<i> want to be more compatible with IE.
</I>
Oh we could add anything to be compatible with IE... the questions are do 
we want to be, and do we need to be.

Like you, I don't know. :-) I want to do some research on this in due 
course, but I haven't been able to do it yet.
