Relatively speaking, SVG is not popular at all.

</I>
MathML was implemented in Gecko years before SVG.

SVG is seeing more implementation work than MathML simply because vector 
graphics has a greater target audience.


&gt;<i> In fact, I do not know a single criticism to MathML emphasizing the

</I>&gt;<i> technical details independent of host language.
</I>
I've received feedback from members of the MathML community to the effect 
of &quot;I wish I could use MathML, but I don't want to use XHTML&quot; (i.e., 
MathML doesn't work in HTML).


&gt;<i> More the rejection from w3c MathML guys that do not want to see a 
</I>&gt;<i> mixture of textual strings with MathML own elements.
</I>
The proposal is not to have textual strings mixed with MathML. It is to 
have simply real MathML, with defined parsing rules for getting the 
MathML out of text/html documents, since text/html isn't XML.


&gt;<i> I imagine that you mean Firefox browser with native MathML. Well I would 
</I>&gt;<i> not call that &#147;extensive and high-quality support for MathML.&#148;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would say, &#147;partial incompletete support of less than one half the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Content MathML is not supported, only presentation MathML; of 
</I>&gt;<i> presentation MathML not all tags are supported; of all tags supported 
</I>&gt;<i> not all are working.
</I>
Ok, partial incompletete support of less than one half the official 
specification. It's good enough to do Math on the Web. (Heck, I was using 
MathML in my university work five years ago.) It's far better, IMHO, than 
you could ever achieve using CSS alone.


&gt;<i> You can begin from the most simple teste of the MathML official test suite
</I>&gt;<i> and can see that MathML suport is weak in browser (I use Firefox 1.0) and
</I>&gt;<i> even most simplest test are either not correctly rendered or not at all
</I>&gt;<i> (compare with sample GIFS).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
With the exception of the notation=&quot;&quot; attribute, these all rendered better 
for me in Firefox 1.5 than they did in the GIFs. I don't see why they 
wouldn't work in Firefox 1.0.


&gt;<i> [CSS could do this...]
</I>
If CSS can do this today, then you don't need any extensions to HTML. I 
would highly recommend persuing this in the microformats.org space, using 
the microformats development principles, and publishing a stylesheet that 
then renders the given microformat as high-quality mathematics.

In my opinion, CSS alone is not even remotely close to enough to render 
mathematics well. I would love to be proved wrong, however.
