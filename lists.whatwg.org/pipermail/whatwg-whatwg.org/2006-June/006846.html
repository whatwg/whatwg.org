I've thought a bit more, and *assuming semantically linked, 
automatically numbered split lists should be allowed* (which so far only 
one other person has even touched on!), I think the best solution would 
be something like the following:

&lt;p&gt;Chores for today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol listname=&quot;chores&quot;&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Clean living room&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Clean bathroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When cleaning bathroom, make sure to get all the grout between the 
shower tiles. Also, the sink needs to be scrubbed, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol listname=&quot;chores&quot;&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Sweep kitchen&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Wash dishes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Numbering would start at 1, and continue in source order (superseded, of 
course, by any start= or value= attributes).

This gives the author the power to number however they want, while being 
much less complex spec- and implementation-wise. A few cases where a 
list is not only split, but the sections are rearranged on the page, 
require the author to fall back on start=, but since it doesn't actually 
remove any functionality, I think that's an acceptable tradeoff.

As for how this would interact with CSS Counters... It appears counters 
in CSS 3 are insufficient even to handle the already-in-spec start= and 
value= attributes. That should probably be taken up with the CSS WG.
