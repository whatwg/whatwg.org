</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, absolutely .. the upcoming microlearning / nanolearning units

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a really particular use case which is hardly representative of

I wouldn't reduce the people from all schools and universities worldwide 
to only 0.1%. But obviously I have to accept the view -- or better the 
fact -- that today's web is much more commercial than scientific or 
educational.

&gt;<i> Maths is certainly less of a core feature for most authors than vector 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics and WHATWG aren't trying to re-implement SVG despite the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> that it too has no obvious IE6 compatibility story, poor CSS 
</I>&gt;<i> integration and various other problems.
</I>
I wish, that WHATWG would have a similar motivation to offer lightweight 
math capabilities parallel to MathML, as they were motivated to support 
vector graphics via the &lt;canvas&gt; element parallel to SVG.

&gt;<i> Nowhere in the WHATWG document does it say that they're going to try 
</I>&gt;<i> and  fix everything. 
</I>
Maybe ..

&gt;<i> You have to choose your battles and, personally, I agree with the idea 
</I>&gt;<i> that, if the proponents of CSS-based maths want to work in the 
</I>&gt;<i> structure of the WHATWG, they should demonstrate the feasibility of 
</I>&gt;<i> their approach using a microformat. Given the constraints under which 
</I>&gt;<i> they have chosen to operate it should be possible to do this without 
</I>&gt;<i> any  difficulties. The microformat based approach has several 
</I>&gt;<i> advantages too, e.g. instant implementation in existing HTML4 UAs (a 
</I>&gt;<i> new markup language would require changes to the parser). This should 
</I>&gt;<i> allow the language to evolve as it encounters real-world needs so, if 
</I>&gt;<i> and when it is formally standardized, it will be a better product than 
</I>&gt;<i> typically results from an standardization-before-implementation approach.
</I>
Assuming the microformat solution will work -- and that it will work is 
already proven by George's implementation -- why should there be a 
reason then in one, two, three years to substitute the well working 
microformats with a new set of math related elements?
