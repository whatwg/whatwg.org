I'm not sure it does...

 &gt; * Should |continue| be an IDREF that can only continue a previous list
 &gt; in the same page, or should it be a URI that can continue lists from
 &gt; other pages?

IDREF. The other possibility is a nightmare.

 &gt; * Can it be defined and implemented in a way that avoids circular
 &gt; references.  e.g.
 &gt;   &lt;ol id=&quot;part1&quot; continue=&quot;part2&quot;/&gt;
 &gt;   &lt;ol id=&quot;part2&quot; continue=&quot;part1&quot;/&gt;

The obvious choice is to use source order i.e. the ID must be defined before the 
continuation in the source, otherwise the attribute is ignored. I don't know how 
hard this would be to implement though.

 &gt; * What does it mean if &lt;ol contine=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; references a &lt;ul id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;?
 &gt; Should it only be able to link lists of the same type?  (i.e. ol with
 &gt; another ol and ul with another ul)

Pragmatically, there is little need for this to work at-all with &lt;ul&gt;.

 &gt; * What does it mean if it references any other element that isn't a &lt;ul&gt;
 &gt; or &lt;ol&gt;?

The continue attribute should be ignored.

 &gt; * What should happen if it references a non-existent element?

The continue attribute should be ignored.

 &gt; * What does it mean if two lists continue from the same previous list?
 &gt; e.g.
 &gt;   &lt;ol id=&quot;part1&quot; continue=&quot;part2&quot;/&gt;
 &gt;   &lt;ol id=&quot;part2&quot; continue=&quot;part1&quot;/&gt;
 &gt;   &lt;ol id=&quot;part3&quot; continue=&quot;part1&quot;/&gt;

That's fine. They both continue from the last value of the list they reference. 
(I can imagine cases where this would be right e.g. a list of instructions for a 
recipe with two variations at the end).

 &gt; * How are references duplicate IDs handled in this situation? (That
 &gt; could probably be the same way &lt;label for=&quot;&quot;&gt; handles it)
 &gt;
 &gt; * Which takes precedence out of &lt;ol continue=&quot;part1&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt; and &lt;li
 &gt; value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;?

continue should take priority over start.

 &gt; * Backwards compatibility is also an issue, though it could possibly be
 &gt; handled with some JavaScript that dynamically calculates and sets the
 &gt; start attribute.

There's not really a backwards compatibility problem here -anybody who cares can 
easily implement this in js.

 &gt; * Would implementations have difficulty with re-numbering list items in
 &gt; linked lists, when a new &lt;li&gt; is dynamically inserted into a previous list?

I would hope not since that's one of the big attractions of this model.

 &gt; * How does it interact with CSS counters.

Good question; don't know. CSS counters seem to have the undesirable property of 
taking content and putting it in the presentation layer.
