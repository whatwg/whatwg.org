Subject: [whatwg] Closing the WHATWG mailing lists
Message-ID: <CAOOOkFcWW97r8yg=SsWg7GgCmp4suVX9o85y8BvNRqMjuc5PXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This list has not been very active in recent years and maintaining the
mailing list setup as our hosting infrastructure change has become a
bit of a burden. Because of this, I'm proposing that this and the
other (even less active) lists are closed in favor of GitHub issues.
If you have concerns about this, please reply here or on this tracking
issue: https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/153

Details follow.

whatwg at whatwg.org as well as the "help" and "implementors" lists will
be configured to auto-reply with an explanation, pointing to
https://whatwg.org/mailing-list which is being updated in
https://github.com/whatwg/whatwg.org/pull/269.

lists.whatwg.org will also be redirected to
https://whatwg.org/mailing-list with an effort made to help find the
original link on web.archive.org.

Philip
