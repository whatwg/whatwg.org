&gt;<i>Sure, but if on the long term, or even medium term, they don't continue to

It's okay for authors who leave deploying content to publisher to stop with
looking at html appearance from browser to users. Xhtml's fewer publishers
maybe bonded abit over-tightly with it if their quantity is lesser
considering how helpful transforms are. Repetitive content over-counted is
more likelier for html than transformable xml serializations. The publisher
may favour plug-ins for flash, jvm, Silverlight and whichever else. However,
small publishers who are impacted by semantic significance of content
grasped by search engine, oft deliver same data using link tag with
rel=&quot;alternate&quot; attribute than difficult to index proprietary plug-in based
formats. The alternate representation might be atom, rdf, ... using grddl
xslt or some such html sibling spec, so xhtml may not be well-supported but
vanilla support is another matter. For my personal interest, I'm looking
forward to seamless iframes, though styled iframe does hide the frame
appearance for javascript that breaks on main xhtml page, and place it in
another page that's plain html. My point is, if the spec can be precise w.
r. t. DOM to avoid usability breakage in xhtml, then the spec hopefully will
be precise,  leaving aside when xhtml should be considered dead to
user-supporters at present.
