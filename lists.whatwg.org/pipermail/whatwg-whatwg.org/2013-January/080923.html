Not just browser vendors. Authors rarely if ever use XML for HTML either.

</I>
Sure, but if on the long term, or even medium term, they don't continue to 
support XHTML, this is no longer a problem.


Anyway, I'm not suggesting that they diverge beyond the syntax (which is 
already a lost cause). All I've concretely proposed is syntax for binding 
Web components in text/html; I haven't described how this should be 
represented in the DOM, for instance. If we define &lt;foo/bar&gt; as being a 
text/html syntactic shorthand for &lt;foo xml:component=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;, or &lt;foo 
xmlcomponent=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;, in much the same way as we say that &lt;svg&gt; is a 
shorthand for &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</A>&quot;&gt;, then the DOM 
remains the same for both syntaxes, and (as far as I can tell) we're fine.


&gt;<i> The idea to stick a slash into the local name of an element in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> bind Web Components is much worse.
</I>
I don't propose to change the element's local name. &lt;select/map&gt; has 
tagName &quot;select&quot; in my proposal.


&gt;<i> Please, let's not make that mistake.
</I>
What do you propose to resolve this problem then?

Some of the constraints are:

 - The binding has to be done at element creation time
 - The binding has to be immutable during element lifetime
 - The syntax must not make authors think the binding is mutable
   (hence why the &lt;select is=&quot;map&quot;&gt; proposal was abandoned)
 - The syntax must be as terse as possible
 - The syntax has to convey the element's public semantics (a 
   specified HTML tag name) in the document markup, for legacy UAs
   and future non-supporting UAs like spiders.
