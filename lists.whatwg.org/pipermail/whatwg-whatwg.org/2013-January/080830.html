</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion seems to have died down here but I'd like to bring up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; another issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; In WebGL land we have creation attributes on the drawingbuffer made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; for a canvas. Example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;     gl = canvas.getContext(&quot;webgl&quot;, { preserveDrawingBuffer: false
</I>&gt;<i> });
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; We're working out the details on how to set those options for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; case where we have 1 context and multiple canvases.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The particular option above would apparently be a huge perf win for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; canvas 2d for mobile. Which suggests that whatever API is decided on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it would be nice if it worked for both APIs the same.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What does it do?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Effectively it makes the canvas double buffered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now by 2d canvases are effectively single buffered. At the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate time a copy of the canvas is made and passed to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compositor. This copy is slow, especially on mobile.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Apple requested that for WebGL the default be for double buffering. When
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; double buffered, when the canvas is composited (when the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JavaScript event exits) the canvas's buffer is given to the compositor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the canvas is given a new buffer (or an old one). That new buffer is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cleared, meaning the contents is gone. It's up to the app to draw stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into again. If nothing is drawn the compositor will continue to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffer it acquired earlier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you mean page flipping, not double buffering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supporting page flipping in 2D canvas would be fine too, but I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> why it would need a change to the API... you would just make &quot;commit()&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> flip which page was active for the context API and clear the newly active
</I>&gt;<i> page in one operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How would you choose flip vs copy with just commit?

Just to be clear we're on the same page. I want to be able to do this (not
related to workers)

   // create a 2d context that flips buffers instead of copies them
   var ctx = canvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;, { preserveDrawingBuffer: false });

But, related to workers, if CanvasProxy is truly a proxy for the canvas
then I could do this

   // create a 2d context that flips buffers instead of copies them
   var ctx = canvasProxy.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;, { preserveDrawingBuffer: false });

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I've been thinking more about this and I'm wondering, for the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being, why have canvas.setContext and why expose the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Canvas2DRenderingContext constructor?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well the constructor is needed so that there's a way to do an entirely

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed but that's a separate problem

Problem #1) Allow a worker to render to a canvas
Problem #2) Allow a worker to render offscreen (without communicating with
the main page)

I'm suggesting we only solve problem #1 for now. To do that, all we need is
CanvasProxy to truly be &quot;a proxy for the canvas&quot;.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> setContext() is only needed so that you can use one context with multiple
</I>&gt;<i> canvases, which is primarily intended to address the WebGL case of having
</I>&gt;<i> one context used to render to multiple views with different settings (the
</I>&gt;<i> settings being themselves set on the canvas or canvas proxy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Right, but since it doesn't doesn't seem to work for WebGL's needs why spec
it now when we can solve problem #1 today and worry about the other
problems later?


&gt;<i> &gt; That means we can solve the 1 context multiple canvases issue later
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making this a minimal api change?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought the &quot;1 context multiple canvases issue&quot; was a higher priority
</I>&gt;<i> than the &quot;canvas on workers&quot; issue. Is this wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't know if it's higher priority. It seemed to inform the worker
related design so it was important to look at.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there some reason that won't work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well I'd rather not design something that doesn't address a known issue
</I>&gt;<i> and then find we have painted ourselves into a corner with respect to that
</I>&gt;<i> other issue. Hence trying to solve all the issues at once, or at least
</I>&gt;<i> solve them in a way that is compatible with future solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed. I'm just trying to make forward progress. The whole setContext vs
DrawingBuffer etc stuff seems possibly orthogonal to the issue of rendering
to a canvas from a worker. I'm wondering if we can separate the 2 issues by
just making CanvasProxy be &quot;a proxy for the canvas&quot; with the same API as
Canvas. Since Canvas already is what it is, any solution for single context
multiple canvases has to work with Canvas. So adding a new object,
CanvasProxy, which is really just a representation for Canvas with the same
API doesn't seem like it adds any new issues.
