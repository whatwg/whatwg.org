Pretty much everything has an origin in practice: it's associated with 
some Window, hence can be treated as having the same origin as that Window.

&gt;<i> Origin checks are only done in some very

</I>&gt;<i> against the &quot;this&quot;.
</I>
I'm not quite sure we're talking about the same thing here.  Can you 
give an example of what you're thinking?

What _I'm_ thinking is that there needs to be a security check when 
someone does 
Document.prototype.getElementsByTagName.call(subframe.contentDocument). 
  This is not the same security check as the one performed by 
subframe.contentDocument.getElementsByTagName (note lack of call; it 
never gets that far in the cross-origin case).  This is independent of 
whether we're doing security checks on all property access or on some of 
them.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is it that we want to avoid the overhead of origin checking if we know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that calling the operation does not leak information?  Or it it that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only a limited set of objects is exposed cross origin anyway, so we only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to check those?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both.
</I>
Implementing different security models on the IDL level is a footgun of 
enormous size.  We should simply have IDL methods throw if called with 
not-same-origin &quot;this&quot; or arguments, except for a whitelist.  In my 
opinion.  Anything else is fragile and leads to security whack-a-mole.

Not that we can have the argument about which interfaces are subject to 
this security check if you want to only limit it to some objects; or 
example you could argue that this is only needed on Window, EventTarget, 
Document, Node, and a few others.  That's a separate argument from 
whether the security checks for those interfaces should be opt-in or 
opt-out.
