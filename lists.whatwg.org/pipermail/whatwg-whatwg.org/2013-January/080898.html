<PRE>I guess I was just way too long-winded.

Buried in there were some good ideas, and I'm no longer strictly 
advocating just a sentence tag.  I read more about how things are 
supposed to work, and I focused on what is needed in general terms, and 
then as many different possible solutions and their pros and cons.

I still think a sentence tag is a good idea, but I would now really 
favor an approach that allows CSS to interpret a pair of spaces 
following terminal punctuation directly as a sentence break, and then 
provide a mechanism to format that directly.  If I had to narrow things 
down to just one choice rather than a spectrum of available approaches 
it would be that one.

It's practical for content developers, straightforward to implement, can 
be easily applied to previously generated content, and does not &quot;ugly&quot; 
up the HTML (in fact the HTML wouldn't even change at all, only a tiny 
bit of CSS would be added).  It's not ideal for semantic sentence 
detection, but is at least a significant improvement there.
