1/ Every time, anyone is presenting some technology, there are always 
questions that technology cannot solve, that does not mean, it's deal 
breaker, tech. is bad whatever.
2/ Did you ask web developers in general? They won't use it anyway, 
what's the point on regular webpage, when majority of browsers has no UI 
for those controls yet? It may be &quot;cool&quot; for them, but they will 
fallback to e.g. jQuery. On the other hand, I focus on developing 
applications using web browser as runtime (I do not use &quot;web 
application&quot; for a certain reason). I do not use jQuery, or any other 
lib. why would I? I do not need those apps to run in every browser.
3/ Way for styling native controls are pseudo-classes, the fact, that we 
do not have those yet is hardly reason for abandoning it. We would have 
no progress at all if we had dropped every technology that is not 
perfect for everyone/everytime. The fact, that there is no way for 
styling is not a reason for abandoning/refusin, but a reson to create 
such pseudo-classes and implementing them. The same way all specs. are 
updated.
