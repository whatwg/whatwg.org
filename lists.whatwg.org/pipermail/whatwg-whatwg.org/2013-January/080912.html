</I>
Is this what you're looking for:
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#imagebitmap">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#imagebitmap</A>


&gt;<i> ctx.unload(image): release the image from memory
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Releasing all reference to ImageBitmap should release it from memory. Are
you looking for a scheme that does not involve garbage collection?

Some of you concerns with memory management could be addressed with
WeakMaps.
Basically, you can put all your images in a WeakMap and during the draw
cycle, you pull them out and use them. If they're no longer there, it meant
that the garbage collector has kicked in to free up memory and you need to
reload (which will unfortunately cause a jank). I'm unsure how smart the
garbage collector is because you probably want the items in the WeakMaps to
be deleted last.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) we can drawImage() every image on startup to force lazy-loading browsers
</I>&gt;<i> to load everything that will be used, but there's still no way to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> which images should be released at the end of a level.  This could be left
</I>&gt;<i> for the browser to determine (perhaps releasing by least-recently-used),
</I>&gt;<i> but perhaps this should be required in the specification?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) leave current behavior as it is and suggest WebGL for this type of
</I>&gt;<i> application
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My preference is option 1, but I don't know if this works for all use cases
</I>&gt;<i> and will work nicely with implementations.  Any thoughts?
