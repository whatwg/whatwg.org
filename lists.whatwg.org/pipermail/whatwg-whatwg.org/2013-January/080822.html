Yes.  I think the spec's security model is not viable long-term, for 
what it's worth, and think we should be designing a security model that 
is instead...  But that's a separate discussion.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is that actually needed?  There are properties you can obtain on objects

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well right now &quot;this&quot; doesn't necessarily have an origin.
</I>
Yes, but that's a fixable problem.

&gt;<i> Also, consider Location. If you have a Location object and then navigate its browsing
</I>&gt;<i> context and then call something on it, you need to check that the calling
</I>&gt;<i> script doesn't match the origin of the new active document, not the origin
</I>&gt;<i> of the Location object's Window's Document.
</I>
I'm not touching Location with a 10-foot pole.  That's all Bobby.  ;) 
Seriously, though, fitting Location into any sort of security setup is 
somewhat hard.

&gt;<i> Doing a check on _every_ call seems rather expensive for implementations
</I>&gt;<i> that don't use Gecko's security model compared to only doing a check on
</I>&gt;<i> those interfaces that matter.
</I>
Clearly I think Gecko's security model is the right one.  ;)

Seriously, though, I'm very much unconvinced by the spec's security 
model.  But you already knew that.

&gt;<i> A Location object has multiple prototypes (one for each origin that
</I>&gt;<i> accesses it).
</I>
That's a pretty new development, no?  In any case, I agree that 
specifically for Location (and perhaps Window) there needs to be weirdness.

&gt;<i> For Storage, the access check has to be the actual origin of the Document,
</I>&gt;<i> not the effective script origin as it does for Window and Document.
</I>
That's a separate check from whether you can even touch the object, no? 
  Certainly that's how it works in Gecko: first there is a generic check 
for whether you can touch the object at all, then for Storage a second 
check.

Note that this situation is similar to data origins for images and 
whatnot: those are also checked against origins, not effective script 
origins.  I don't see the problem here.

&gt;<i> Assuming the script's effective script origin is not the same as the
</I>&gt;<i> crossOriginDoc's effective script origin, it doesn't matter _what_
</I>&gt;<i> myGetter points to. It should always throw, either TypeError (or some
</I>&gt;<i> such) if myGetter points to something that's not on Document somehow, or
</I>&gt;<i> SecurityError, if myGetter points to something that _is_ on Document.
</I>
Well, or TypeError in both cases, yes.  But OK, we agree on this, good.  :)
