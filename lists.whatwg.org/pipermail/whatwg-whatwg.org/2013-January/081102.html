You really cannot find any usecase?
I use Chrome's week and month (and other) regularly...
month data: events within a month, articles published in given month, 
users registered in given month, money spent in selected month...
week span: I do not want my users to count what is the monday 3 weeks 
from now or have to select 2 days when all they want to say is exactly 1 
week
the same goes for other types other combinations.

sure user can select a day within week or within month...
1/ that is confusing, if user chooses november 2013 I want user to see 
november 2013, not 8th november 2013
2/ app would have to determin the boudaries, extract month or compute 
which week is it (e.g. if I have week statistics computed I have data 
for 31W2013 as a one identifier)
