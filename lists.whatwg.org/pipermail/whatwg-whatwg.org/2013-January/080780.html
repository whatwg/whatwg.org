</I>
Implementations of the spec (i.e. browsers).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you elaborate on what updates are needed? I couldn't see any that

</I>
It is? I don't think that's one of the use cases I've seen before. It's an 
interesting use case, though, true.


&gt;<i> This means that a hit regions can contain shapes that were drawn with 
</I>&gt;<i> different winding rules. The current path syntax does not allow you to 
</I>&gt;<i> store this information so you can't set up a hit region that was drawn 
</I>&gt;<i> with an [even-odd fill].
</I>
The Path objects just store paths, not filled shapes, so you can't really 
store non-zero-based shapes any more than even-odd-based shaped, if you're 
going to mix them.

If this (the region accumulation thing) is a use case we should support, 
then we need a way to add paths together in a way that converts all the 
paths to a specific fill rule type (ideally to be agnostic of the rule).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As Dirk mentioned, instead of making it part of the graphics state, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's more likely better to make it part of the fill or clip operator 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; like SVG, PDF and PostScript.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That seems like it would be inconsistent with the rest of the canvas 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Winding is specific per draw and unlikely to persist across several draw 
</I>&gt;<i> commands. This makes it different than color or the stroke style.
</I>
I'd have thought that would make it exactly like the stroke style.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The easiest way to implement this, would be to leave the core 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interface of canvas alone and just extend the path object with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; winding rules and a method to 'simplify' a path so it can be drawn 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with any winding rule.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This doesn't seem like it would be easier... in particular, fillRule 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is now implemented in two browsers, so the implementation cost for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them would be zero, and they don't yet implement Path at all, so the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation cost for Path would be quite high, even without 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;simplify&quot;. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's easier because of all the other work that's necessary to make this 
</I>&gt;<i> feature work correctly. So, yes, it is easier now because they don't 
</I>&gt;<i> rely on the spec to implement stroking and they don't have an 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation for paths.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, the spec is supposed to be followed (right?) and at some point, 
</I>&gt;<i> paths should be implemented. Going the easy way now will give a headache 
</I>&gt;<i> later.
</I>
I'm happy to defer to the browsers vendors on this -- browser vendosr, 
what would be simpler for you to implement?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; However, just look at how stroke is implemented in the Canvas 2d 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; spec or how you can create paths by stroking or stroked text. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; They're all affected by the winding rules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How so?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, take a figure eight that is stroked. If you draw it out, 
</I>&gt;<i> you will see that you cross 2 lines to get to the middle which means 
</I>&gt;<i> that there will be a gap when doing an [even-odd fill].
</I>
Could you elaborate on this? How would you propose this should be changed?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (The description on how to do strokes in the spec is very wrong, but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that can be addressed later)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you elaborate on this? If there's a mistake obviously I'd like to

If you could just file bugs for each mistake, that would be great.
