The temporal order isn't that useful. Consider:

   &lt;a/&gt; &lt;b/&gt; &lt;c/&gt;
   a.show(b);
   b.show(c);
   a.appendChild(c);

I think we're forced to rely on the tree order here too. It's unfortunate, 
but I really can't see a better solution.

It should. I've tried to make this explicit, but it was supposed to be 
already required by the use of the word &quot;while&quot; and other such phraseology 
in the requirements.


&gt;<i> Relatedly, it's not clear what happens if anchor is display: none or is 
</I>&gt;<i> not in the document when show() is called, but later has a rendered box 
</I>&gt;<i> and is in the document. And the reverse: if it is in the document when 
</I>&gt;<i> show() is called and later is removed.
</I>
The requirements apply continually while they match, so while one is 
'display:none' (or not in the doc, or whatever) the 'position' property on 
the anchored element will compute normally, but once the conditions are 
met, it will compute to 'absolute-anchored', and then the requirements on 
'absolute-anchored' apply.

</I>
How should I change the spec to not be badly designed here?
