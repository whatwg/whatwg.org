That's why I originally proposed it as a pragma comment (which I'm pretty 
sure would be just as safe, because anything that stops someone from 
escaping a string injection in any way will stop both identifiers and 
comments, and it seems highly unlike that someone would go out of their 
way to let you escape a string literal and be allowed to inject a comment 
but not be allowed to inject a division or method call or whatnot).


&gt;<i> Worse, other seemingly trivial syntactic transformation also break the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> foo();
</I>&gt;<i> breakParsing.call();
</I>&gt;<i> bar();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the JavaScript parse won't recognize the magic &quot;breakParsing();&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> production, and my script executes slowly.
</I>
So let's not use something that looks like a method call -- I agree that 
isn't ergonomically or aesthetically pleasing.

</I>
Advantages of putting this in JS over multipart:

 - it's backwards-compatible
 - it's easier to parse a static barrier than a multipart/*'s wacky 
   syntax.
 - it doesn't impact any of the current fetching logic, since it's 
   still just one resource instead of introducing a layer in between 
   &lt;script&gt;'s logic and the JS logic.
 - it automatically works anywhere you can use JS, not just where HTTP is 
   involved.
 - it can be shimmed more easily (if you trust the JS not to have 
   arbitrary injection and be written with the shim in mind, especially).
 - it doesn't run into weird problems like what if a part has the wrong 
   MIME type.
 - it's way easier to deploy (authors hate having to set MIME types).
 - it doesn't run into the problem that all UAs have historically ignored 
   the MIME type of script.


&gt;<i> HTTP already has an efficient mechanism for delivering several 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript programs in sequence: multipart.
</I>
&quot;Efficient&quot; isn't the word I would have used.


&gt;<i> Given that &lt;img&gt; and &lt;iframe&gt; already support multipart, it seems much 
</I>&gt;<i> simpler just to make &lt;script&gt; support multipart as well.
</I>
Given how much pain multipart was to handle in &lt;img&gt; and &lt;iframe&gt;, 
avoiding it like the plague seems like the more appropriate lesson. :-)
