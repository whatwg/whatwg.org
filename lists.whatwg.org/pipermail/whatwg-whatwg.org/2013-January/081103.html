</I>Hi,

I think there are a lot of use cases for week and month input types. I 
know a lot of organizations using week numbers and i'm pretty interested 
to use this markup for my entreprise web apps even if it's currently not 
really implemented.

I will go more far. I'd like to have an &lt;input type=&quot;day&quot; /&gt;. I often 
have the need to create forms where the user choose an interval of 
&quot;days&quot;. By example, from 1st March to 30 November. Currently i use 
&lt;input type=&quot;date&quot; /&gt; and i ignore the year.

The use cases i encountered for that is maintenance control 
programmation that differs in term of number of occurences and control 
types during the year. By exampe , in winter, there are no wash because 
of the low temperatures. On hollyday, there are no children on the 
schools and less work for the agents. Etc...

I mean there are a lot of different events/task that differs that way 
(car maintenance, train ticket costs) and it would be very nice to have 
it working out of the box :).

Have a nice day !
