I don't think a million authors do such things. Instead, a few people 
may develop libraries for the purpose.

</I>
Since the use cases are rare, is it better to force browser vendors to 
develop code to implement it, in their own ways, than to let various 
software developers set up libraries for it? Since the browser 
implementations would, with practical certainty, lack adequate 
localizability (according to page language) and customizability, the 
HTML construct would not be used much.

Authors, or their employers and clients, don't want just &quot;a date and 
time picker&quot; for example. They want a picker that suits their overall 
design. I don't think this will change anytime soon. Pages now use a 
wide variety of date pickers. While &lt;input type=date&gt; might be useful 
for testing and quick prototyping, and might be used by 
functionality-oriented authors who don't care much about look and feel, 
&lt;input type=datetime&gt; would rarely be used even for such purposes, so it 
would be an undue burden on browsers
