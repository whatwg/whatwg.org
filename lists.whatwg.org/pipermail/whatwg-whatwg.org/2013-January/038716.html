</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The thread seems to have died down due to insufficient applications

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually the reason this thread hasn't gone anywhere is that there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to only be implementer interest from Chrome.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See:

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for explaining!

</I>&gt;<i> I can file a bug against Firefox, and argue for it. I think I would have 
</I>&gt;<i> an easier time making an argument if I knew how the API should look

</I>&gt;<i> likely to agree with?
</I>
Whatever browsers are willing to implement, basically.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1) This would make it possible to write JavaScript libraries that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; seamlessly scan the current page for &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; and add 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; integration with Dropbox / Google Drive / Sky Drive etc. I claim that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; changing the &lt;input&gt; value is the easiest and most robust method of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; achieving this without requiring changes to the main application 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; code. Asides from providing an easy path for developers to integrate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; online storage services into their apps, this change would make it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; easy to write bookmarklets / browser extensions that add this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; functionality to any Web application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems like this use case would be better handled by having the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sites offer an API to the browser, similar to Web Intents, for picking 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a file. That way you wouldn't need to update each site -- every site 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would support all the drive systems you use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but that approach would require deeper application changes. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> that adding a couple of &lt;script&gt; tags next to an existing &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; is easier to implement.
</I>
On the one hand, we require every application that can read a file to 
modify their code to support the &quot;drive&quot; providers, and we require the 
drive providers to provide code to support this, and we need UA changes, 
and we make it hard to competitors of drive-like products to compete 
(since anyone popular enough to be included by the sites that support this 
will have a network effect advantage).

On the other hand, we require only &quot;drive&quot; providers and user agents to 
write code, and every site that reads files supports every provider that 
implements the API, and there's no barrier to entry for competitors.

I think the second is _significantly_ better all around.

But there are other use cases (such as the ones you listed) for which it 
makes sense to be able to add files to &lt;input type=file&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; There are places where FileList definitely needs to be readonly, so I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't think it makes sense to make it globally writable. but there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be a MutableFileList or something. That feedback should be sent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the list mentioned at the top of the File API spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FileList doesn't have to be mutable if there is a FileList constructor 
</I>&gt;<i> that accepts File instances, or if the files attribute of &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; accepts an array of File instances and converts it into a 
</I>&gt;<i> FileList.
</I>
Indeed, both of those solutions would work too. There could also be a 
method on HTMLInputElement to push files into .files, or to clear .files, 
or some such.
