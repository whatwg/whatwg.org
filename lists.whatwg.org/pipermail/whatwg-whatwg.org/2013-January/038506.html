</I>
I've added progress events (loadstart, progress, and loadend) to &lt;img&gt; 
processing.

</I>
I've restricted the events in this way. ('loadstart' always fires; 
'progress' only fires if it's CORS-same-origin, and 'load', 'error', and 
'loadend' fire as simple rather than progress events if it's not 
CORS-same-origin).

If you want the events, just use CORS.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a recap, if you don't want to wade through the bug comments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Hans - You're saying that the [image] loadend event is useless?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Ian - Yes.  It only saves typing a few characters, img.onloadend =
</I>&gt;<i> function () { }; vs:  img.onload = img.onerror = function () { };
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Hans - It's useful if you want your listener to run after all of the
</I>&gt;<i> load listeners have run, and code that you haven't written adds its own
</I>&gt;<i> load listeners.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Ian - That seems like a rather obscure edge case, and you can work
</I>&gt;<i> around it using setTimeout() (in the load/error event handler) anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Before carrying on, I should point out that the proposal to add 
</I>&gt;<i> loadstart, progress, and loadend events to Image was modeled on XHR and 
</I>&gt;<i> based on the ProgressEvent spec <A HREF="http://">http://</A> www.w3.org/TR/progress-events/. 
</I>
Note that progress events are now specced in <A HREF="http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.">http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.</A>

 
&gt;<i> It may be that supporting the complete set of ProgressEvents for images 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't add enough utility to be warranted.  We proposed supporting all 
</I>&gt;<i> of the ProgressEvents (even loadend) for the sake of consistency.  And 
</I>&gt;<i> we're aware of the CORS issues.
</I>
I did add them all for consistency (well, almost all, I didn't add 
'stalled' and 'timeout'), but loadend is still basically useless. :-)

I don't think it's useful in other uses of Progress Events either.


&gt;<i> As an aside, it's odd that if images are unsupported or disabled, no 
</I>&gt;<i> event is fired at all (&quot;update the image data&quot;, step 4).  That means 
</I>&gt;<i> that if you do this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> var url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
</I>&gt;<i> img.src = url;
</I>&gt;<i> img.onload = img.onerror = function(e) { URL.revokeObjectURL(url); }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the blob will leak a reference if images are disabled.  This seems like

It'd be pretty sad to use up all that bandwidth for no reason...
