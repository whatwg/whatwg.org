Most things don't have an origin. Origin checks are only done in some very 
specific places where you try to get an object's properties; what we're 
saying here is that for those properties, you also need to do the check 
when you run the code behind those properties (e.g. call a method), 
against the &quot;this&quot;.

(Note: This is not what Gecko does. Some Mozilla people have been 
petitioning me to change the model in the spec to be more like Gecko's 
model.)


&gt;<i> Is it that we want to avoid the overhead of origin checking if we know 
</I>&gt;<i> that calling the operation does not leak information?  Or it it that 
</I>&gt;<i> only a limited set of objects is exposed cross origin anyway, so we only 
</I>&gt;<i> need to check those?
</I>
Both.


&gt;<i> For the actual wording of the check, we could either have a &quot;security 
</I>&gt;<i> check&quot; that is performed at the right time in #es-operations etc. and 
</I>&gt;<i> which HTML defines to do the origin checking, or we can make Web IDL 
</I>&gt;<i> aware of origins itself, and then HTML would define what origin 
</I>&gt;<i> different objects come from.
</I>
In the case of Location, it's not about the origin of the object, it's 
about the origin of the active Document of the Window. See the &quot;Security&quot; 
sections in the HTML spec for examples of what we have now (there's one 
for Window, one for Document, and one for Location -- I think that's it).
