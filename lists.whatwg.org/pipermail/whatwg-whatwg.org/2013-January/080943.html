</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
*All* behavior of stepUp/stepDown is easy enough for authors to work around
to cover cases where they don't agree with the spec.

But if they have to, I don't see why they wouldn't simply not use
stepUp/stepDown and implement whatever functionality that they want.

The functionality that these functions provide is very little. So if they
don't solve the authors use case exactly I think its easier for them in
almost all cases to simply write their own implementation. Especially if
you take into account the time and effort involved in looking up how the
function works.

So if we are going to have these functions at all, I think it should be
possible to simply make the implementation of a button as simple as:

&lt;button onclick=&quot;elem.stepUp()&quot;&gt;...
&lt;button onclick=&quot;elem.stepDown()&quot;&gt;...

And that this should in all cases produce good UI in as many cases as
possible, and should never throw any exceptions.

If we can't fulfill those use cases and requirement, then I think we might
as well remove these functions.
