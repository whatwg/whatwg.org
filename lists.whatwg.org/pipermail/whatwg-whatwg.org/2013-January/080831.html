An argument to the context constructor, probably.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    // create a 2d context that flips buffers instead of copies them
</I>&gt;<i>    var ctx = canvas.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;, { preserveDrawingBuffer: false });
</I>
I would do it like this:

   var ctx = new CanvasRenderingContext2D(100, 100, { mode: 'pageflip' });
   canvas.setContext(ctx);

   ctx.fillRect(10,10,10,10);
   ctx.commit(); // implies clearRect(0,0,100,100);

   // later
   ctx.fillRect(11,11,10,10);
   ctx.commit(); // implies clearRect(0,0,100,100);



&gt;<i> But, related to workers, if CanvasProxy is truly a proxy for the canvas

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    // create a 2d context that flips buffers instead of copies them
</I>&gt;<i>    var ctx = canvasProxy.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;, { preserveDrawingBuffer: false });
</I>
CanvasProxy doesn't have getContext(), because the direct mode doesn't 
make sense cross-process. You would do:

   var ctx = new CanvasRenderingContext2D(100, 100, { mode: 'pageflip' });
   canvasProxy.setContext(ctx);

   // draw...


&gt;<i> Agreed but that's a separate problem
</I>
These are all related problems that contribute to the design of the same 
API.


&gt;<i> Problem #1) Allow a worker to render to a canvas
</I>&gt;<i> Problem #2) Allow a worker to render offscreen (without communicating with
</I>&gt;<i> the main page)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm suggesting we only solve problem #1 for now. To do that, all we need 
</I>&gt;<i> is CanvasProxy to truly be &quot;a proxy for the canvas&quot;.
</I>
I'm solving #2 now too. (Actually it's already solved in the spec.) I'm 
happy to only discuss #1 if you want, but #2 influences the design of the 
API for #1 so the conversation will be weird if we ignore #2.


&gt;<i> &gt; setContext() is only needed so that you can use one context with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple canvases, which is primarily intended to address the WebGL 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case of having one context used to render to multiple views with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different settings (the settings being themselves set on the canvas or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; canvas proxy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but since it doesn't doesn't seem to work for WebGL's needs why 
</I>&gt;<i> spec it now when we can solve problem #1 today and worry about the other 
</I>&gt;<i> problems later?
</I>
It seems to work fine as far as I can tell, as shown by the examples in my 
recent e-mail.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is there some reason that won't work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well I'd rather not design something that doesn't address a known 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue and then find we have painted ourselves into a corner with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; respect to that other issue. Hence trying to solve all the issues at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once, or at least solve them in a way that is compatible with future 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. I'm just trying to make forward progress.
</I>
At this point I'm not aware of any problems with the current proposal 
(what's in the HTML spec plus adding setSettings() in WebGL, making the 
WebGLRenderingContext constructable, and providing an in-worker 
alternative destination for WebGL for when you don't want to draw to a 
canvas, as discussed in my earlier e-mail today).


&gt;<i> I'm wondering if we can separate the 2 issues by just making CanvasProxy 
</I>&gt;<i> be &quot;a proxy for the canvas&quot; with the same API as Canvas.
</I>
That doesn't work for 2D. The original API (getContext) relies on implicit 
commits, and we can't do implicit commits sanely in a worker. That's the 
main reason for having a different mechanism (setContext).

Anyway, I don't really understand what's wrong with the proposal that 
addresses all the problems that have been raised at once. I don't see a 
need to do this bit by bit when we've already got a full solution.
