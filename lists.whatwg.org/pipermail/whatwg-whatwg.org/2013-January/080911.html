Strongly agree with Henri that XML tools provide a lot of leverage on
the web today, and you don't want to give that up.

I once wrote a primitive web crawler in shell using NetBSD's 'ftp'
utility for fetching web pages, Nhat Minh L&#234;'s one-of-a-kind 'xmlgrep'
utility to extract hrefs, and 'tidy' to convert from HTML or dodgy
XHTML to well-formed XHTML.  It wasn't a very sophisticated or
full-featured crawler, but it was tiny, fast, transparent, easy to
extend, and it would have been impossible to whip up in a couple of
hours if I didn't have in my pocket an &quot;XML multitool&quot; that I could
apply easily to web pages.

It seems to me that app-specific annotations, such as you can add to
XHTML with XML namespaces, are valuable both on the server and on the
browser, where they are visible and usable by application JavaScript.
