</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for popup menus (menus that appear when you click on or activate a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; control, et cetera).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We should not give authors the power to override the UAs context menu.

</I>
Agreed. I have added the following to the spec:

# User agents may provide means for bypassing the context menu processing 
# model, ensuring that the user can always access the UA's default context 
# menus. For example, the user agent could handle right-clicks that have 
# the Shift key depressed in such a way that it does not fire the 
# contextmenu event and instead always shows the default context menu.


&gt;<i> I know what you mean. I remember using a company website where you 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't paste into a text field for a search because the webmaster had 
</I>&gt;<i> apparently decided that the clipboard was the work of the devil.
</I>
Weird.


&gt;<i> &gt; Thankfully, descent browsers now prevent authors blocking/overriding 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the context menu, let's not make it easier for them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who's to say the UA couldn't just append the menu to the context menu?
</I>&gt;<i> Or append the browser context menu as a submenu? Or provide a context 
</I>&gt;<i> button as part of the control?
</I>
Good idea. Added:

# The user agent may also provide access to its default context menu, if 
# any, with the context menu shown. For example, it could merge the menu 
# items from the two menus together, or provide the page's context menu as 
# a submenu of the default menu.


&gt;<i> Or allow access to the context menu when an additional key is pressed 
</I>&gt;<i> (such as alt + [right-click])?
</I>
See above.


&gt;<i> The UA vendors aren't stupid. Let's provide a semantic and let them 
</I>&gt;<i> figure the behavior out for themselves.
</I>
In general it takes a few versions with users complaining before the UAs 
get the right balance, but sure. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not objecting to having elements specifically for menus, as long 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as their names are semantic (unlike &lt;popup&gt; which also suggests its 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presentation), I object to the method you have proposed for accessing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the menu.  The method should not be defined like that, but should be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; left to UA and the presentation (CSS) and sometimes behavour 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (JavaScript) layers to determine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then simply change &quot;popup&quot; to &quot;menu&quot;. Simple enough. I'm not married to 
</I>&gt;<i> the word &quot;popup&quot;; I'm simply trying to distinguish it from a context 
</I>&gt;<i> menu.
</I>
Currently I have used the words &quot;popup&quot; and &quot;toolbar&quot; (on the type=&quot;&quot; 
attribute of the &lt;menu&gt; element, because they were the only words I could 
find that were easy to type and understand.

I'm open to better ideas, though.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The deal breaker for me, though, is that you can't tell what the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hyperlink does just by looking at it. For instance, what does the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; following do?...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;#guess&quot;&gt;Does this point to a menu?&lt;/a&gt;
</I>
I agree. I've removed this feature from the spec. It was stupid.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    Now, figure out what this does:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; | &lt;button popup=&quot;obvious&quot;&gt;This displays a popup menu.&lt;/button&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That will only display a popup for visual UAs, which is why I object 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the name popup for the attribute and element.  In UAs that don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support popups, the text is meaningless.  It provides no information 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about its purpose or what information can be accessed by activating 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you honestly trying to tell me that you don't think popup menus can 
</I>&gt;<i> be done in text mode?!? How is it we can do menus in text mode but not 
</I>&gt;<i> popups? Remember that by &quot;popup&quot;, I mean a method of accessing a menu by 
</I>&gt;<i> activating or clicking on a control. If you don't like the name &quot;popup&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> then fine, but I don't see while the underlying principle of activating 
</I>&gt;<i> a menu with a button or other control is impossible in text mode UAs.
</I>
Yeah, I don't really understand here. Popup menus in text mode have been 
possible for decades...
