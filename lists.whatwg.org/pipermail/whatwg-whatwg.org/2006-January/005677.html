It would be very interesting to hear opinions of Mozilla security group on  
this particular proposal about &lt;sandbox&gt;, and maybe some changes would  
turn it from difficult to simple. As I'm not an implementer of a browser,  
I don't know what is simple to implement and what is not.

&gt;<i> If you want to write up &lt;sandbox&gt; in a spec, that's up to you. But a
</I>&gt;<i> quick skim-read of your list of seven points leads me to think that the
</I>&gt;<i> devil is in the detail. For example, how do you programmatically isolate

</I>&gt;<i> the inside has set a setter function on that value, how do you make sure
</I>&gt;<i> the setter runs with the right privileges?
</I>
All code which is physically written inside the sandbox is restricted.  
This includes setter functions. It doesn't matter how did the function get  
called -- as a result of an event, or because it's called from the  
outside, or because it's a setter.

&gt;<i> These are all issues Firefox has faced when trying to sandbox content
</I>&gt;<i> inside chrome, and it required a large change to the way the two
</I>&gt;<i> interacted (XPCNativeWrappers, if you want to Google for it). I guess
</I>&gt;<i> it's possible that this mechanism could be reused to sandbox content
</I>&gt;<i> from other content...
</I>
Yes, I'll learn about XPCNativeWrappers and maybe correct my proposal so  
that it's closer to what is actually implemented.

&gt;<i> Also, how do you prevent inner &quot;safe&quot; script from e.g. overlaying
</I>&gt;<i> content on top of any arbitrary part of the page using absolutet
</I>&gt;<i> positioning? You have to try and allocate particular bits of the page to
</I>&gt;<i> particular sandboxes. That's a nightmare.
</I>
Thanks for pointing this issue out, I'll think about how to address it, if  
it needs to be addressed at all. Maybe a set of restrictions should be  
specified as attributes of the &lt;sandbox&gt; element, similar to your  
restrictions like &quot;create&quot;.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They clearly state that they would like to allow scripts, but they don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know how to do it safely. I think it's not just a problem of this  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular site.
</I>
&gt;<i> I know people _want_ to do it, just as people wanted pretty coloured
</I>&gt;<i> scrollbars and so IE added a proprietary extension to CSS to allow it.
</I>&gt;<i> What I don't see is a compelling reason _why_ - something above the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Ooh! Coloured scrollbars!&quot; level.
</I>
Scripts today is not just like coloured scrollbars. Maybe scripts aren't  
particularly useful within blog entries, but there is a place where they  
can be useful: in user-defined journal styles. AJAX can be used to create  
a highly interactive style (rich user experience). Currently, JS in  
user-defined journal styles is forbidden, too, because of the cookies.
