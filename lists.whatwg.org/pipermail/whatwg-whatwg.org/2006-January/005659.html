Not if there's a script on the page playing with the disabled attributes. 
Suddenly they have more stylesheets than they were expecting.

It could change the favicon, e.g.


&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   If frames are supported/enabled then
</I>&gt;<i>     The script is not executed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
This requires UAs to have a concept of &quot;is this script being inserted into 
a &lt;noframes&gt; context&quot;. This isn't necessarily a problem, but it's a change 
from what happens now.


&gt;<i> &lt;base&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   This one may be a problem, but very few pages use base anyway, let
</I>&gt;<i>   alone within a noframes or noscript element.  It could probably just
</I>&gt;<i>   be completely ignored.
</I>
&lt;base&gt; is used more than &lt;embed&gt;, more than &lt;h4&gt;, more than &lt;pre&gt;, more, 
in fact, than &lt;frameset&gt; and &lt;noframes&gt;. I don't think it's safe to say 
that &quot;very few pages use base&quot;.

It's possible that it is rare to see &lt;base&gt; inside &lt;noframes&gt;, though I'd 
feel better after having checked for that. However, in the case of 
&lt;noscript&gt;, I'm sure I've actually seen cases like:

   &lt;noscript&gt;
     &lt;base href=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/noscript&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     document.write('&lt;base href=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;');
   &lt;/script&gt;

...or similar. I've definitely seen things like:

   &lt;noscript&gt;
     &lt;div class=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/noscript&gt;
   &lt;script&gt;
     document.write('&lt;div class=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;');
   &lt;/script&gt;

...to change what is open and what is not on the fly.

&gt;<i> &lt;title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   If there is already a page title, this should be ignored.  If there
</I>&gt;<i>   isn't, use this and the page will gain a title, which is hardly much
</I>&gt;<i>   of a backwards compatibility concern.
</I>
But if you ignore it, then your DOM is going to be different if you have 
frames or if you don't. Which is what I thought you were trying to avoid. 
(This argument applies to several other cases where you suggested ignoring 
a tag.)


&gt;<i> Form Controls (input, select, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>   These do not become associated with any form element outside of the
</I>&gt;<i>   noframes and are thus, not submitted.
</I>
How do you prevent the association? Consider form=&quot;&quot; pointing at a &lt;form&gt; 
in a &lt;noscript&gt; section.


&gt;<i> There is one case I can think of that may cause problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;noframes&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;p id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/noframes&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;p id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   var foo = document.getElementById(&quot;foo&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>   ...
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it were parsed as markup instead of CDATA, calling getElementById() 
</I>&gt;<i> would return the one within the noframes element, but I can't imagine 
</I>&gt;<i> this case being very common at all and if it only breaks 1 in a million 
</I>&gt;<i> pages who really cares!?
</I>
If it only breaks one in a million pages and that page is CNN.com?

There are billions of pages out there. One in a million is several 
tens or hundrends of thousands of pages.


Another problem (which I just noticed on CNN.com) is that if we say that 
&lt;noframes&gt; creates nodes, browsers will be creating nodes for &lt;img&gt; 
elements that previously they were not creating, which will cause a 
different set of images to be fetched from the server.

Also, if there are links in &lt;noscript&gt; blocks, they will now start being 
added to the document.links array. This might affect scripts that know 
what is in that list.


Also, your suggestion was that &lt;noscript&gt;/&lt;noframes&gt; close all inlines 
that were opened inside them. That would break cases like:

   &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a ...&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
    ...
   &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

...in non-script UAs (assuming that the UAs should have the same DOM 
whether scripts are enabled or not).


&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you meant about problems with image maps, unless you 
</I>&gt;<i> were talking about a case like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;noscript&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;map name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/noscript&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;map name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;...&lt;/map&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;img ... usemap=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is somewhat like the getElementById example above in that the 
</I>&gt;<i> reference to the map element is now ambiguous, but again, I don't think 
</I>&gt;<i> this is a major backwards compatibility concern.
</I>
What is the problem you are trying to solve? You are dismissing many 
backwards compatibility concerns as being minor; the cumulative risk of 
all these minor concerns actually being major has to be outweighed by the 
advantages of your approach. What are they?


&lt;noscript&gt; and &lt;noframes&gt; (and other such elements) should be considered 
more as #ifdefs than as elements, IMHO.
