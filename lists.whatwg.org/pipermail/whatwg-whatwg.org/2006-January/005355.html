</I>&gt;<i> I haven't had time to investigate it fully (like inspecting the real DOM in the

</I>
Yeah, IE creates empty element nodes for element tag names it doesn't 
recognise. This leads to amusing things like tags called &quot;/foo&quot;.


&gt;<i> It shows like a processing instruction though, not a comment. Firefox 
</I>&gt;<i> simply drops all processing instructions (or bogus comments) and you can 
</I>&gt;<i> not retrieve them in any way. Opera stores them in some quirky way. When 
</I>&gt;<i> looking at the innerHTML of the page I get things like: |&lt;? 
</I>&gt;<i> target=&quot;test&quot; content=&quot;&quot;/&gt;?&gt;| for a processing instruction which looked 
</I>&gt;<i> like: |&lt;? test&gt;|. We'll fix that sometime when it gets more important 
</I>&gt;<i> and when it is clear what we're supposed to do.
</I>
The current proposal is to treat them like a simple comment. We could 
treat them like a PI but that would require even more error states, since 
we'd then have to distinguish &lt;/ foo &gt; and &lt;? foo &gt; (spaces intentional).

Note that treating them as comments still leaves room for changes later as 
we can just say that &lt;? ... &gt; is treated specially if we want to -- 
changing the comment node to a PI node, e.g. -- without breaking older 
pages.

Anne was referring to the current proposal in the spec:

&gt;<i> To me, it seems reasonable to drop invalid constructs like &lt;? test&gt;.
</I>
I agree. I think treating them as comments is better though.

It's not a conformant construct, though.

Indeed. See the current proposal for one possibility.

The current proposal is just a straw man, by the way. It, as everything 
else in the draft, is very open to change.
