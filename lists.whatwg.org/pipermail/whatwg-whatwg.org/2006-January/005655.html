Why can't it just be defined that noframes and noscript content gets 
parsed exactly as regular markup and define that form controls within 
noscript don't get submitted with forms and that scripts within noframes 
or noscript elements must not be executed?  This problem currently 
exists for XHTML and it would need to be defined that way anyway because 
UAs can't cheat with a different parsing mode in XML.

For XHTML in Firefox, scripts within noframes aren't executed, even 
though they are included correctly within the DOM.  Unfortunately, in 
Opera and Safari they are executed.  But for all of those browsers, 
however, within noscript elements, scripts get executed and controls get 
submitted.

Although, since it's XHTML, there aren't that many backwards 
compatibility constraints (if any) caused by people depending on the 
behaviour.  In fact, most authors would expect the same behaviour as in 
HTML (considering that's how most use it) so changing the browser 
behaviour shouldn't be a problem at all.
