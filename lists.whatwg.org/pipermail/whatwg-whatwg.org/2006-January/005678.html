Hi Gerv,
first of all: it's great to get some fresh ideas here. You've seen 
the earlier thread and it didn't get enough brainstorming going.. 

My colleage Sigbj&#248;rn had some thoughs, forwarding with his 
permission:

&gt;<i> ------- Forwarded message -------
</I>&gt;<i> From: &quot;Sigbj&#248;rn Vik&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Evil-knights] Fwd: [whatwg] Content Restrictions

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I support the idea, but not the granularity of it. The author is trying to

</I>&gt;<i> would be able to call some other function in a parent frame which is

</I>&gt;<i> choices.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> (To make it possible to override things for a given page without having to

</I>
I generally agree with those comments (except the META tag 
statement). There can be quite some security in simplicity :-)

You replied to Alexey Feldgendler:

&gt;<i> What problem are you trying to solve with this proposal? I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> it's the same one that I am. You are trying to solve the problem of
</I>&gt;<i> letting LiveJournal authors include certain types of &quot;safe&quot; script on
</I>&gt;<i> their page, when currently they aren't allowed to include any.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to solve the problem of protecting users from XSS attacks
</I>
But actually the details of your approach are powerful enough to have 
other use cases, so you're covering similar ground to what Alexey and 
I were discussing.

The main complexity in doing anything in this area is probably the 
flexibility of JavaScript. I don't think any UA really keeps track of 
the origin of each script - they are all associated with the domain 
of the page they are running in, and that's how same-origin security 
policies are applied. However, trying to make that more granular is a 
major headche. That's why I really like your approach of (as far as I 
can see) defining policies that are applied to all scripts in the 
document. Of course it limits what sort of scripting the webmaster 
can deploy along with the possibly insecure scripts, but it is a very 
interesting angle.
