I'm a 100% with Ian here, LINK is dead.

&gt;<i> It could offer &quot;shortcuts&quot; (key combo's) to standard LINKs like

next/previous - most pages on the internet don't have a meaningful
next/previous state, and those that do are generally only navigated
via forms.  And the few places you do seem them, people don't have a
problem navigating it and only want to do so after consuming the page
(e.g. a multipage article)

help - how many sites does this apply to?

so search - marginally relevant and home are the only ones that are
really used regularly - your Etc. is a pretty big etc. as there really
aren't any more.

&gt;<i> (As to us &quot;failing&quot;: 5 years ago only lynx and iCab offered LINK support.
</I>
And IE of course, okay through an extension, but still, that's the
same as with other current UA's you're counting.

LINK's have certainly failed, there is simply not enough consistency
in webpages to meaningfully derive labels that have meanings which
cross these types - take a few popular pages, say a mapping service, a
wikipedia article, a book on a bookshop page, an auction page, a
personal photo page, and create the LINKs here that would provide the
consistency to make it useful to users.

Jim.
