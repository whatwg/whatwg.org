</I>&gt;<i> well-formedness to HTML, even though it's not formally defined for it),
</I>&gt;<i> but it's certainly not valid according to any official DTD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sorry.  I don't notice that this is invaild.  I am new here.  What
makes inline-level element not feasible to contain block-level
elements??  I am confused.

&gt;<i> &gt; If breaking things is unavoidable, I prefer breaking things which are written incorrectly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No-one is intending to break anything that is written correctly.
</I>
I should change my line to &quot;break things that are not well-formed
instead of those well-formed&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My idea is very extreme but simple and effecient:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Parse the page regardless of what between &quot;&lt;/&quot; &amp; &quot;&gt;&quot;.  See what's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written inside the close-tag merely a visual clue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example: &lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;Y&lt;/div&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; + span
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   + div
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     + #text: X
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   + #text: Y
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm kind of confused by what you're trying to do there.  You seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly closing the div immediately before the span.  But then the Y
</I>&gt;<i>   doesn't seem to be a child of the span at all in the markup, it looks
</I>&gt;<i> like it should be a child of the div, yet in your DOM, it's not a child
</I>&gt;<i> of the div, but is of the span.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The DOM look equivalent to this markup:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;X&lt;/div&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It is my fault for not explaining it more clearly.  Here I treat a
close tag like, what is written inside the close-tag doesn't matter to
the parser.  So your observation is correct.  I don't read and guess
what should I do when &lt;/span&gt; is given instead of &lt;/div&gt;.  I treat any
&lt;/xyz&gt; after &lt;div&gt; to be &lt;/div&gt;.  If somebody write a webpage not
well-formed, then the error will be displayed in such a distubing way
that no one can ignore it.  If the error is by mistake (which I
presume to be the only reason of a page not well-formed), web
developer(s) can catch the source of problem more easily - the error
will be observable *from* the starting point of the error *to* the
ending point of the error.  If this is too insane to everyone, as I
have said before, this idea is &quot;very extreme&quot;.  I do not suggest that
this will be the best choice.

&gt;<i> which is insane.  It would make a little more sense if it were like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    + span
</I>&gt;<i>      + div
</I>&gt;<i>        + #text: X
</I>&gt;<i>    + #text: Y
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, it would be equivlant to this markup:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;X&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Y
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is actually quite sane and is what OpenSP does with invalid HTML,.
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of which elements are used (presumably according to some SGML
</I>&gt;<i> rules), but it would not be compatible with the current state of the web
</I>&gt;<i> at all, and so is not a real option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To correctly written webpages, this should pose no problems.  To
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incorrect webpages, they deserve it since the point they ask the UA to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use &quot;standard mode&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In theory, that sounds nice, but you have to remember:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;to a rough approximation, all the content on the Web is errorneous,
</I>&gt;<i>     invalid, or non-conformant.&quot; -- Hixie
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, to say &quot;they deserve it&quot; to 100% of the web (roughly speaking) isn't
</I>&gt;<i> really an option, unfortunately.  It's ok to say it to the most
</I>&gt;<i> pathological of cases that depend on one particular browser's insane and
</I>&gt;<i> undefined error recovery techniques, yet already breaks in everything
</I>&gt;<i> else, but not to the whole web.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>First, my idea would not, and should not, break the whole web.  If it
is really deployed, it would only break webpage that are not
well-formed in this particular way.
Second, this discussion begins to be for error-handling in HTML5.  I
believe the motto &quot;Make the wrong looks wrong&quot;.  Since the
introduction of CSS and its ability to do &quot;div span { blahblahblah;
}&quot;, we can't go back to IE's insectual appoach.  If the error-handling
mechanism make people feel mixing open-close-tags &quot;okay&quot; and then the
mechanism doesn't work up to their expectation occasionally, they will
blame the browser and never notice their fault.  Unless we can find a
perfect mechanism which will never &quot;break&quot; their expectation, the
problem will go on.  And I suppose the mechanism we are discussing
here should be used only in HTML5 onward, something the whole web not
using these day.
Of course, if someone can suggest a mechanism which does not &quot;break&quot;
things, I will love it.
