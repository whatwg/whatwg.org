Well sure, I struggle through such sites myself. The problem would not be 
aleviated by having a single point for site navigation, because the 
problem is just that the sites have poor structure. It doesn't matter how 
you _present_ the structure, if the structure itself is broken.

</I>
Well go and convince them and when you have some implementations we can 
add it to the spec. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; I tried to get &lt;link&gt; reliably and widely implemented for around five 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; years. I failed. I don't see why we would be more successful with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; display:meta.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand your point about time, but I think you're forgetting a

</I>
(Actually, this is a common mistunderstanding. It isn't standards support 
that is valued. It is interoperability. Standards support is merely one 
way to help foster interoperability.)


&gt;<i> In other words, the current situation is different from that of 5 years 
</I>&gt;<i> ago.
</I>
I didn't say I tried to get &lt;link&gt; implement five years ago. I said I 
tried to get it implemented _for_ five years. About four of those five 
years were more recently than five years ago.


&gt;<i> Something like display:meta wouldn't have stood a chance back then, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it might today.
</I>
I'm not convinced. Please prove me wrong. :-)


&gt;<i> As to us &quot;failing&quot;: 5 years ago only lynx and iCab offered LINK support. 
</I>&gt;<i> Today Opera and Mozilla do so too, even WinIE can, through a third-party 
</I>&gt;<i> tool, and last but not least some automated Web publishing systems 
</I>&gt;<i> generate LINKs. If I'd had to choose between labelling that as &quot;failure&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;success&quot;, I'd have to pick &quot;succes&quot;. The only thing we failed at is 
</I>&gt;<i> getting WinIE to support it natively - and I don't see how we could not 
</I>&gt;<i> have failed at that.
</I>
Neither of the two biggest browsers (IE and Firefox) ship with support for 
&lt;link&gt; navigation as standard. Neither expects to do so in their next 
version. Thus some 98% or so of users don't have access to &lt;link&gt; 
navigation UI. Similarly, 98% or so of pages don't have any links for such 
UI to hook into in the first place, so even the few users who could use 
such a UI, rarely see it. CMS-based blogs and autogenerated documentation 
are the typical exception, but they aren't a big part of the Web (the 
blogosphere's collective ego notwithstanding).

I couldn't call this a success without diluting the meaning of the word.
