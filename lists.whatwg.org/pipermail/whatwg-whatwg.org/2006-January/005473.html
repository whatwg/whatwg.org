<PRE>On Tue, 17 Jan 2006 14:59:10 -0800, James Graham &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">jg307 at cam.ac.uk</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Or are you also in favor of &lt;float-left&gt; &lt;float-right&gt; and so on?
</I>
Are you seriously asking me this, or are you just making a point?

&gt;<i> As a more general point, the notion of tying a element to a particular  
</I>&gt;<i> default presentation is weird because an author, a UA or a user can  
</I>&gt;<i> override that default. This is why it's preferable to have meaningless  
</I>&gt;<i> elements have the simplest possible style rules.
</I>
I'm beginning to loose track of what you are saying. Please don't explain,  
though, because I'm also beginning to loose interest. Seriously. I'd  
rather end this discussion.

&gt;&gt;<i>  Well, font would have been used within good semantic markup,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume you mean &quot;would _not_ have been used...&quot;, otherwise I'm missing  
</I>&gt;<i> your point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without CSS, whereas what I am proposing is to use it with CSS. So,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the old way, using &lt;FONT&gt; means extra markup, most likely with no  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra semantics. With my suggested way, there would be the same amount  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of elements as well made documents, and less markup than what is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practised now by experts.
</I>
I meant &quot;would have&quot;, because the point is that if we didn't have CSS,  
then &lt;FONT&gt; would have been used. Thus, I said, &quot;font would have been used  
within good semantic markup, without CSS&quot;. Before CSS, people used &lt;FONT&gt;.  
Thus, there could have been good markup, but it would have been messed up  
with &lt;FONT&gt; and friends. I would not use &lt;FONT&gt; because we now have CSS. I  
said, &quot;whereas what I am proposing is to use it with CSS&quot;. If I recall  
correctly, I meant &quot;use the element that we are discussing with CSS&quot;, not  
the &lt;FONT&gt; element, and thus the page would be well structured.

&gt;<i> Less markup? How? Because you could write &lt;big&gt; rather than &lt;div&gt; and a  
</I>&gt;<i> style deceleration?
</I>
No, so you could write &lt;CENTER&gt; instead of &lt;DIV CLASS=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; plus the  
modifications in your style sheet. That's hardly any savings, but it is  
cleaner code.

Also, I never said that. &lt;BIG&gt; &amp; &lt;DIV&gt; are completely different, and thus,  
I wouldn't consider replacing them or mixing them, unless the text content  
was unique.

The fact that you brought that up, even though that was the exact opposite  
 from what I had in mind, shows me that this discussion needs to end. It's  
creating the worst possible effects.

&gt;<i> So you propose saving a few bytes (maybe) at the expense of encouraging  
</I>&gt;<i> authors to use markup that is device-specific (i.e. only applies to  
</I>&gt;<i> graphical browsers), making it more likely that they will create  
</I>&gt;<i> inaccessible sites &quot;because the spec says you can use &lt;big&gt; to make text  
</I>&gt;<i> big&quot; (when what they reallky want is e.g. &lt;h1&gt;).
</I>
If they wanted a &lt;H1&gt; to represent a title, then they should have said so,  
and demonstrated it. I suppose that the WHAT-WG might have said so, but I  
thought that it was in the brainstorming stage. I admit that it is widely  
practised, but so the usage of &lt;BR&gt; and other problems.

&gt;<i> using CSS for positioning rather than tables (say) creates one, large,  
</I>&gt;<i> cacheable, style file and a selection of smaller pages of markup which  
</I>&gt;<i> generally loads faster, at least after the first page.
</I>
I totally agree.

&gt;<i> And I would rather see non-expects encouraged to learn which semantic  
</I>&gt;<i> markup is useful (and, importantly, how users benefit) than create a  
</I>&gt;<i> bloated spec full of presentational elements for every occasion.
</I>
I wouldn't want a bunch of presentational elements for every occasion.  
That's kind of my point.

&gt;<i> I certainly disagree with Ian that /all/ non-semantic markup should be  
</I>&gt;<i> ditched
</I>
Okay.

Which Ian? I thought that I saw 2 &quot;Ian&quot;s.

&gt;<i> If you use &lt;center&gt; or &lt;big&gt; to markup headings, text that is often both  
</I>&gt;<i> large and centered, it prevents me from creating a useful navigational  
</I>&gt;<i> outline of your page.
</I>
I don't think that I once encouraged the use of &lt;BIG&gt; to markup headings.  
I'm opposed to it. I'm also opposed to using &lt;CENTER&gt; to markup headings.  
I'm very surprised that you said this. Maybe this is getting to personal.  
People obviously aren't listening.

I must say that as I proofread this, I actually find it fascinating that  
you thought that that is what I was claiming. Maybe I mistyped or  
something, but I suspect it's a different case. I think that the  
discussion became somewhat heated to point that 2 ideas became merged due  
to how our memory works.

To everybody, please end this discussion with 1 last comment for the sake  
of a conclusion. I promise to try not to respond.

If there is anybody that agrees with any of my proposals, other than  
&lt;MENU&gt;, then please let me know off-list. I'd be interested in getting to  
know you.

Sincerely, and with thanks,
Eugene T.S. Wong
