I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't fire onsubmit at all, only that 
perhaps it would be more backwards-compatible if onsubmit took place 
after the UA validation. However your point is a good one: the site 
may want to do something in the submit handler that makes the form 
valid (such as giving a hidden required field a value).

I'm not sure if making that impossible would be a big limitation. I 
assume the scripts could use other events like onchange events of 
other form elements.

&gt;<i> The problem here is actually a problem of backwards compatibility
</I>
Exactly, that's what I'm worried about.

&gt;<i> current user agents do not stop submission when maxlength is too long.

</I>
HTML 4.01 says nothing about UA form validation so I don't think what 
it says is relevant.

&gt;<i> You should implement the behaviour only for documents identified as a Web
</I>&gt;<i> Forms 2.0 user agent.
</I>
I think we've been there, discussed that and voted against using any 
xmlns or DOCTYPE tweaks to distinguish a document as a WF2 one.

The only thing I want to discuss in this thread, is: should firing 
the onsubmit event and UA validation happen in reversed order to 
ensure backwards compatibility with scripts that believe a form has 
been submitted when it hasn't due to a validation error?

Note: I have not  read this section of the spec recently, comments 
are based on an implementation.
