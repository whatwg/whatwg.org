</I>
   First of all, &lt;center&gt; has an obviously presentational name that has
been used in previous pages specifically for centering text. This alone
encourages non-semantic use. Secondly, if it's nothing more than a
&lt;section&gt; or &lt;div&gt; with a specific presentation, there's little point in
having it because the semantics are already covered. Remember that the
user agent defines the default presentation for an element, not HTML. If
I want &lt;center&gt; to left justify text by default in my browser, I can do
that. To require otherwise tampers with the very semantic underpinnings
of HTML.

   I'm sure you're going to point out that &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are
presentational, but take a look at the HTML 4.01 spec...

(<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/graphics.html#edef-B">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/graphics.html#edef-B</A>)
|<i> Rendering of font style elements depends on the user agent. The
</I>|<i> following is an informative description only.
</I>
   Right now a user agent can present &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; however it wants, even
though they clearly imply a presentation.

   Not also that we could just as easily bring back the |align|
attribute and use it for exactly the purpose you suggest. In fact, it
would be better because you could use it on multiple elements. (In fact,
HTML 4.01 defines &lt;center&gt; as being a short hand for &lt;div
align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;.) But then, why not just do this?...

|<i> &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> I suppose &lt;big&gt; is a bit like &lt;h1&gt; but surely we could just reintroduce  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;font&gt; and be done with it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, font would have been used within good semantic markup, without CSS,  
</I>&gt;<i> whereas what I am proposing is to use it with CSS. So, with the old way,  
</I>&gt;<i> using &lt;FONT&gt; means extra markup, most likely with no extra semantics. With  
</I>&gt;<i> my suggested way, there would be the same amount of elements as well made  
</I>&gt;<i> documents, and less markup than what is [practiced] now by experts.
</I>
   No, it sounds to me like people would just find old tutorials on
&lt;center&gt; that are outdated markup and copy the code. Then we'd have to
deal with people using a bunch of deprecated markup all over again. That
doesn't reduce the amount of markup.

&gt;&gt;<i> I mean, they load slower, usually use &lt;font&gt; tags instead of headings,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which reduces the readability and accessibility of the page and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generally have a negative impact.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, generally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, just for the record, standards compliant pages don't  
</I>&gt;<i> automatically load faster.
</I>
   While a poorly written standards compliant page can be quite bloated,
a well written one will almost always load faster relative to the amount
of semantic information it contains.

&gt;&gt;<i> Whilst it is not implausible that a few select presentational elements  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may improve the overall correct use of meaningful elements on the web,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> history suggests that providing a raft of graphical presentational  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements at the markup-language level encourages the use of poor-quality  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> markup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you on this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I'd much rather that the non-experts misuse the non-semantic  
</I>&gt;<i> markup, than the semantic markup. An entire society can't even speak 1  
</I>&gt;<i> language consistently, let alone mark it up semantically.
</I>
   Clearly, &lt;center&gt; does not encourage use of semantic markup in cases
where semantic markup is more appropriate, though. For instance, I
believe you gave an example where you were using &lt;center&gt; and a series
of &lt;h1&gt; elements in a situation where &lt;h1&gt; and a series of &lt;h2&gt; elements
would have been more appropriate. People would simply start using
&lt;center&gt; for headers, paragraphs and other things, especially on user
agents where the presentation is identical or nearly identical.
