As I have stated before [1], 'spacer' is arguably the element with the  
most semantic information (namely that this element is used for layout  
hacks only and can be ignored for every other purposes), losing  
information when replaced with &lt;img src=&quot;./spacer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; because the  
UA now doesn't *know* that the image is useless, but can assume so based  
on factors like URL, image dimensions, content, and above all the  
specified empty 'alt' attribute. Going from 'img' to 'object' loses more  
information, to be exact the very 'alt' attribute to separate the useful  
 from the useless.

Obviously I don't want the 'spacer' element back, 'spacer' is obsolete  
with CSS if not before. But the loss of information is real. If a UA wants  
to do a best attempt for an 'object' in a context where the object itself  
can't be rendered the UA will know next to nothing about the object. Yes,  
'object' has fallback (which 'img' too could have had if it hadn't been  
defined to be EMPTY) so there is little dispute what to render, but it  
doesn't know what it has missed. Depending on the object and the fallback  
the fact that the preferred content wasn't rendered can be anything from  
inconsequential to critical.

The danger with making an aspect of a markup language mandatory, like the  
mandatory 'alt' attribute for 'img' and the mandatory 'title' element in  
'head' is that the editor/author will need to use filler content that may  
reduce the quality of the attribute/element in question. With 'alt' this  
has the consequence 'alt=&quot;&quot;' means either that this image has no alternate  
representation (and presumably semantic content) or that it has been  
automatically been filled in to make the document validate. It is fairly  
acceptable, but it would have been better that no 'alt' attribute at all  
had been used in the latter case.


Another datum that is lost from 'img' to 'object' is that the embedded  
object is supposed to be an image, and not e.g. an embedded HTML document,  
an applet or a video. In theory the content type could have given that  
information (text/*, image/*, audio/*...), but the 'type' attribute is  
optional, and in any case the non-informative application type is very  
common.

In this aspect (and not that many other) I like SMIL. In addition to 'ref'  
(the general 'object') it has 'animation', 'audio', 'img' (like HTML),  
'text', 'textstream', and 'video'.
