True, that can also be a cause. But imagine for a moment a situation where at
least the majority of browsers in use would have a nice NAV display:meta
implementation, making it *visible* to people how they can organize the data
they publish. Wouldn't that work as a guide, helping those who are not that
well-organized realize how to publish their content in a more organised
manner? They might well think &quot;Ah, I can do like that other site: make a
contact and a help page and tag 'm with display:meta to put them in that
navigation thingy. I can even make &quot;sections&quot; that way to different parts of
my site. k3wl.&quot;

That's how it works with most things: some technique becomes available in a
nice and obvious form and suddenly people start using it.

My impression was that representatives of most browsers subscribe to this
list. So I'm assuming they've already heard me. Maybe they're silently
laughing at the nonsense I'm talking. Maybe they're already enthusiastically
implementing it. I've no idea.

Anyway, I don't think we want to go back to the days where a browser defines
its own new standards which other browsers are then forced to copy, faults
included because by then too many authors/users are relying on that specific
implementation. Makes more sense to me to all of us try to agree on something
we think could work, and only then start work on (experimental)
implementations and a spec.

Agreed. Well put.

Working on it ;)
