This is a general problem with event handlers -- any document using script
will have different behaviour if you remove all the event handlers.

For example, if you take the following HTML4 fragment:

   &lt;form&gt; &lt;button&gt; Test &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt;

...the behaviour will be radically different if, when the fragment was
serialise, the &lt;form&gt; element had an event listener that cancelled any
&quot;submit&quot; events.

</I>
I fail to see how an issue tracker would improve matters in this respect.

If I really do omit to respond to a comment, I assure you it was either a
mistake, or because the comment did not appear to be relevant (for
example, the point above about reserialisation isn't relevant since, as
described above, it is an issue with event listeners as a whole, not with
the onreceived=&quot;&quot; attribute).

If you think I skipped a comment by mistake, I urge you to reraise the
issue (as you did here, and as one would have to do with an issue
tracker).

Cheers,
