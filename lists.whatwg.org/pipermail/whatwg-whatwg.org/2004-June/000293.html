You can add event listeners -- you just have to make sure the attribute is
present as well. This is required because otherwise in order to implement
this, every time you submitted a form you would have to wait til you had
completely parsed the new document before tearing down the old one, which
is of course unacceptable. This way, the author has to give a clear sign
(adding an attribute) that this is acceptable for him.
