Sorry, I understood the intention was to take a pretty much complete
spec to the standards org such that nothing but minor changes were
necessary for it to be approved - that's my usage of RubberStamped.  I
hope that's the intention, it all seems a much too long process
otherwise.

&gt;<i> WHATWG's proposed specifications are co-opting the meaning of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;text/html&quot; MIME type just as they are co-opting the meaning of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;</A> namespace.  There really is no difference.
</I>
I don't actually agree with this interpretation of the text/html
registration (I believe it applies to any HTML, e.g. ISO-HTML) so the
WHATWG's HTML would also be valid, if I'm wrong (and I probably am)
then I would oppose it yes, and would suggest
application/prs.hixie.html (and a +xml one for the XML version) for
development and testing yes.

&gt;<i> By &quot;awful&quot; I presume you mean &quot;standards compliant&quot;.
</I>
Yep, but it's an awful standard.

&gt;<i> The parsing change is
</I>&gt;<i> the one change I explicitly mentioned was different between XHTML and HTML
</I>&gt;<i> processing. It's amusing to note that this is the part of my e-mail that
</I>&gt;<i> you decided to ignore in your reply, especially in light of your
</I>&gt;<i> accusations that I was ignoring your feedback.
</I>
No, I've not accused you of ignoring anything, just missing it...  I
generally don't bother commenting on stuff I fully agree with or are
obvious, but I didn't consider the failing to render something a
parsing issue.  In any case I don't have a process here, I'm only here
to try and improve my life with a good spec, I can ignore all I want
should I choose to, I've not tied my hands.

&gt;<i> &gt; they fixed this along with their mime-type sniffing spec violations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any bug numbers for the &quot;mime-type sniffing spec violations&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> or, failing that, any URIs demonstrating them?
</I>
Some of it is documented in:
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/mimetypes.html">http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/mimetypes.html</A>

(where it sniffs text/plain) the previous firefox release also
announced with relish that now files would be sniffed for media
mime-types even if the mime-type is text/plain.   No idea of the
bugzilla references, bugzilla is a web-app I've never managed to get
the hang of.

Jim.
