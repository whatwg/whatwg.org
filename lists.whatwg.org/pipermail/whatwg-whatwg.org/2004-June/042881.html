Oh, does graceful degradation matter whilst we're developing it, it's
perfectly possible to get IE6 to render a document sent as that as if
it had been sent as text/html - I would hope the other browsers have
similar extension mechanisms for enabling new mime-types to be
identified with some tweaking.   After all no-one's going to be
shipping release code during this development phase.

&gt;<i> Oh you are complaining that when a document sent using one of the three

</I>
No, the media types one, which I can't easily find but was on
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/</A> at the previous release, it
wasn't just the above feature.
Ah, here we are:
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=7GUgc.115%24_o3.1200%40bgtnsc05-news.ops.worldnet.att.net">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=7GUgc.115%24_o3.1200%40bgtnsc05-news.ops.worldnet.att.net</A>

&quot; Firefox 0.8 and Moz 1.7b both have this fixed.  The browser sniffs the 
file and offers to download it and open it in yourt default media player.&quot;

The text/plain document in question contains no invalid characters

Jim.
