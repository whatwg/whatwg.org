</I>
My impression is that WHAT addresses both: the Web Forms 2.0 spec 
improves the capabilities of those form-based 'web applications' that 
are implemented in terms of web pages, like Amazon and eBay, in a 
backward-compatible manner, and the Web Applications (and Web Controls?) 
specs are intended to allow applications to look more like 'regular' 
applications, presumably including things like toolbars, menu bars, and 
so on (disclaimer: I've not looked at the WebApps spec properly).

So, Web Forms 2.0, is, well, just what it says on the tin. Plus, it 
should be backward-compatible with IE6. *Some* parts of it might require 
a JavaScript 'emulation' layer for non-supporting UAs, but the majority 
of it should 'just work', albeit with a less-rich interface in 
non-supporting UAs.

Web Applications is the equivalent of XAML, XUL, and so on, though based 
around an HTML framework, and leveraging the Web Forms 2.0 spec for some 
of the content. Think of this as 'Amazon with custom chrome', possibly.

Regards,
Malcolm
