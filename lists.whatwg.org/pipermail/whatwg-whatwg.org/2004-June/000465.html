Well Ian has said that W3 members can't say they're going to submit
something to the W3, but since everyone keeps claiming that they're
all individuals (they're not W3 members) then they would be free to
say that they would hope they could submit it to the W3 if they can
get a member to sponsor it.  Alternatively they could rule out the W3
and say which other ones.  I don't think it should be too hard to
provide a roadmap.
