Ian's still a W3C member (as an invited expert to the CSS WG, if nothing 
else), so even if he's not representing the W3C at the moment, it's not 
unreasonable for him to continue to be bound by their rules. 

But yes, saying 'We intend to submit this to a standard organisation' should 
be something that can be included in the charter. That's the only thing, 
really, that they're missing.

Malcolm
