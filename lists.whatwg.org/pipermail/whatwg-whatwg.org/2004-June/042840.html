I suggested on the WG, not on the mailing list, the same as with the
accessibility expertise.

&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but it doesn't - so I guess you're conceding there isn't one -

Not really, as the WHATWG obviously subscribes to the view (lots of my
objections would be gone if you weren't stepping on XHTML toes) you
can publish your own HTML version without complaint from me, I think
it's a very good thing.

&gt;<i> &gt; why not just an HTML vocabulary though (then you don't need to pollute

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because to UAs that implement both, there is no difference between HTML4

</I>
I don't agree with that!  Mozilla certainly does lots of awful things
with application/xhtml+xml content that it doesn't do with HTML
content.  In any case it's not an answer, indeed it's more of an
argument for doing just one, since there's no different and UA's
implement both.

Jim.
