I don't understand the relevance (nor why you seem to keep mentioning
gmail as if it's some competent web-application, the code is
reasonably competent script, but it's not a good web-application, and
the large security holes in Google suggests that the organisation as a
whole, don't know much client-side at all, they are not to be used as
a recommendation.

You could of course create gmail so it degrades to work in lynx yes.

Rubbish, you've obviously never seen the users of web-tv units.

</I>
I've done that, lots of time (for example the fieldset suggestion for
select-editable)  there's no point just adding more comments until
you've addressed the others.

&gt;<i> I assure you use cases were the basis of every feature in the spec.
</I>
Maybe bringing that discussion into public would help. As at the
moment, I really don't see the use cases for a lot of it.

&gt;<i>The use case for the datetime control
</I>&gt;<i> is any system that needs to have an exact time, e.g. a calendar
</I>&gt;<i> application,
</I>
Could you point me at such an application existing on the web at the moment?
