The behaviour with script is whatever the script does, and without script
is a form submission. Hardly &quot;nothing&quot;.


&gt;<i> which is bad, but it's better than the WF2 suggestion which would give

</I>
Eh? Where did the poultry come from. You only need to set the attribute,
not give it a value. Just set:

   onreceived=&quot;&quot;

...and your event listener will be used if present, and the form
submission will continue as per normal (although with a slower,
non-incremental, page load).

I don't really understand what you are complaining about.


&gt;&gt;<i> I fail to see how an issue tracker would improve matters in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh right, I do, since everything would have a &quot;this is issue # X and we
</I>&gt;<i> can easily see that it was addressed, and how it was addressed.&quot;
</I>
You can do that now. Look at the archives in Thread view.


&gt;&gt;<i> the point above about reserialisation isn't relevant since, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> described above, it is an issue with event listeners as a whole, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the onreceived=&quot;&quot; attribute).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, since we're forced in your WF2 to put an attribute in, which doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> make sense unless the script exists but does exist then, normally with
</I>&gt;<i> Event listeners if the script doesn't exist neither do any of the
</I>&gt;<i> dependant attributes, with this method we have the dependant attributes,
</I>&gt;<i> but no script to handle it.
</I>
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're trying to say here. Could you give
an example?


&gt;&gt;<i> If you think I skipped a comment by mistake, I urge you to reraise the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue (as you did here, and as one would have to do with an issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tracker).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I'll generally know when you don't respond to mine, I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> when you don't respond to other peoples issues, and they may be highly
</I>&gt;<i> relevant, but I can't know, if we have an issue tracker we can see
</I>&gt;<i> that the open issues exist.
</I>
Every WF2-related e-mail above:

   <A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-June/date.html#210">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-June/date.html#210</A>

...is, as far as I am concerned, a closed issue. (There are Web Apps
e-mails above there that are still open, but those are mainly listing
requirements, not issues.)

So if someone sent a WF2 e-mail and it is above that line, and I haven't
replied to it, and it is still relevant, then I missed it. I couldn't find
any such e-mail just now, but let me know if you find one.

The e-mails after that line are those that I am still replying to.
