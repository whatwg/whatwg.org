 &gt;&gt; You could make the argument against box, but hbox and vbox are two
 &gt;&gt; of the best supported XUL tags in existence.
 &gt;
 &gt; And &lt;font&gt; is one of the most supported HTML tags, but that doesn't
 &gt; make it a good tag either.

    If you look at the second half of that paragraph (which you did not
quote), you will see that I stated we should probably drop those 
elements from &quot;Keymaster&quot; anyway. This is due to the fact that 
&quot;Keymaster&quot; was designed to augment XHTML, not duplicate its functionality.

 &gt; I'm just saying that the markup XUL uses may not be the best, and
 &gt; that anything that is put into the WHAT specs would be designed on
 &gt; its own merits, with a look for compatibility with HTML. For example
 &gt; the &lt;menu&gt; element already means something in HTML so couldn't be
 &gt; used.

    The &lt;menu&gt; element is depreciated in HTML 4.01, and it doesn't exist 
at all in XHTML, which is what &quot;Keymaster&quot; was intended to be used with.
Furthermore, the child element for the HTML &lt;menu&gt; is &lt;li&gt;, while the 
child element for the XUL &lt;menu&gt; is &lt;menupopup&gt;, so in a well written 
web page the child elements are mutually exclusive. Just put in a check 
to see if there are any &lt;li&gt; tags for the sake of backward 
compatibility, and when the check turns back true, treat &lt;menu&gt; as a 
&lt;ul&gt; element and ignore all menu-related child elements inside it.

    Then again, if we actually integrate &quot;Keymaster&quot; into HTML, we can 
simply rename the tags to whatever's convenient.

 &gt; The term &quot;XUL motor&quot; doesn't mean anything, maybe you mean &quot;XUL
 &gt; rendering engine&quot; or &quot;XUL host&quot;.

    Well, &quot;XUL Motor&quot; is a term used by Gerald Bauer, so I should have 
known better. ;)

 &gt; In either case, the WHATWG work is not aimed at XUL
 &gt; rendering engines but at HTML and XML+CSS rendering engines
 &gt; (primarily IE, Mozilla, and Opera).

    Fair enough. I'll move the XUL Basic suggestion to a W3C list and we 
can continue to discuss &quot;Keymaster&quot; as a possible enhancement to HTML on 
this mailing list.
