+1

Incidentally, what's the way you 'almost &quot;solve&quot;' it with CSS?

&gt;<i> 3) As per HTTP protocol, a compliant UA should NOT send any data to 
</I>&gt;<i> server when user activates history action. So, I have to keep all 
</I>&gt;<i> session related data on the form so that UA can keep track which data 
</I>&gt;<i> belongs to which dialog. If my application stored any live session 
</I>&gt;<i> data (instead of just user settings and other more or less static 
</I>&gt;<i> things) on server end a single press of the back button would cause 
</I>&gt;<i> the server and client to go out of sync and the whole logic would 
</I>&gt;<i> collapse. Currently all links are problem because if I have 30 links 
</I>&gt;<i> on a generated page, I have to repeat session data 30 times (once for 
</I>&gt;<i> each link so that no data is lost once a link is activated). I cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> use cookies because I want to support running multiple user accounts 
</I>&gt;<i> in multiple UA instances (user1 in window1 and user2 in window2). 
</I>&gt;<i> Cookies cannot fork either, see below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) and 5) The issue here is really a forking problem.
</I>
Although I completely agree with you about the problem (and that 
cookies are not a solution), you already point out the obvious thing to 
do:

&gt;<i> [1] As I think it further, I think _document_id_ is worthless because 
</I>&gt;<i> even the server could generate an unique identifier for every page 
</I>&gt;<i> (like getCurrentTime() for example).
</I>
In my web applications, I actually go much further: not only does the 
server generate a unique id for each page view, it also generates a 
unique id for each link, form, and input element.  This makes a whole 
bunch of headaches related to form processing simply go away.
