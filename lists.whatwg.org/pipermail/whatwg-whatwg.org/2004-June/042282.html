I understand your point, but this sounds like a document keeping track 
of bugs in IE, which I feel is inappropriate for a web design 
specification. This specification would not propose any new features, 
but only give a list of ones that already exist.

No, I meant a list of extra &quot;features&quot; for web-designers (like 
document.all, etc.). A list of how they're not compliant is probably not 
listed but may be documented elsewhere (I remember reading such a 
document awhile back).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My point is that it would be far more useful to do something like a 
proprietary add-ons specification considering that it would propose new 
features. I'm not saying that the WHAT WG should turn these specs into 
advertisements (especially not for MS extensions, which are generally 
unhelpful). It seems like a waste of time and effort to display 
specifications that don't propose any kind of evolution in web design. 
I'm not saying that this kind of documentation would be bad, it would 
actually be very useful (knowing myself from being a web designer), but 
I don't think a specification is the place to have this.

&gt;<i>    I can understand, though, if there isn't a lot of support for my 
</I>&gt;<i> idea. It's a lot of work with very little glory. Meanwhile, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> working hard on my next specification suggestion...
</I>

I'm not saying it's a bad set of documentation, I just think it's 
inappropriate in a specification. This sounds like the kind of 
documentation that would go on a website about webdesign. I would 
personally would love this kind of documentation! I've always had 
problems finding out where the bugs exist in IE and trying to find out 
what line of code specifically annoys IE.
