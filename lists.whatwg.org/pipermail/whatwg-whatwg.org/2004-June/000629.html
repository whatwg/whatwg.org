This will only happen if you mis-use them, since it is quite possible to
set up conditional comments so that they appear to just be SGML comments
to other UAs.


&gt;<i> Also please remember you cannot talk about condtional comment

What on Earth has ECMA-262 got to do with anything here?


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I also don't really see why the fact it violates the spec here is a bad

I doubt it. Real world Web sites depend on those extensions.

I am baffled why, if you think it's fine for everyone to include logical
extensions, why you are &quot;disgusted with Opera, Apples and Mozilla
involvement in this deliberate subversion of internet standards&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; No, they're not. They all get returned as strings, not at all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following the principles outlined in the section you cited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since they're not validating UA's there's no doctype reading going on,

</I>
Not a forwards-compatible choice if that attribute was defined as a
boolean or a number, though, is it.
