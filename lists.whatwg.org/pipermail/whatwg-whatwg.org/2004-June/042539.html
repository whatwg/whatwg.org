I'm not actually confident it is non-conformant (ECMAScript has lots
of get outs allowing all sorts of extensions.)  but it's on the
interpretation of \b - Mozilla is more generous than the standard on
what concerns a character, it's better IMO, and I wouldn't bother
filing a bug as I'm sure it'll resolve as wont fix.

I believe it's at least SHOULD, as we noted there's high risk of bad
implementations, or buggy implementations, and this would at least let
people carry on and achieve their end.  Bugs in UA's shouldn't stop
pages working.

&gt;<i> but it's a *lot* easier to fix a broken UA than it is to

</I>
Right, but I don't care about other sites (in fact it may be to my
advantage that they're broken) I do care about my scripts, and it's
much easier to fix those than it is to fix a broken UA, and get it
deployed.  What's Opera's update process on Symbian, how is easy it to
patch that, and motivated does the user need to be? - fixing browsers
may be easy, distributing them is not.

Cheers,

Jim.
