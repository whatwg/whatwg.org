</I>
I think I've understood the reason of our divergences. If I interpret
you rightly, the problem is that a intranet user is visiting a insecure
site inside the intranet and a web app pops up and he is fooled to use
this app. The scenario I have in mind is another one: you need to do
your job using several well known web apps in your intranet. You know
that the CRM apps is at <A HREF="http://mydoamin.com/crm.">http://mydoamin.com/crm.</A> That's it: navigation
vs. app delivery.

I don't see web apps just as an improved www, but as well as a
replacement in several circumstances.

And again, there is no hostile enviroment that affect in special way web
apps outside browser.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; *) The cost of add this feature in the SPEC is not so big: It is Web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; forms outside html. Substract CSS and add the window and layout tags,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; and that's all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't see why you have to substract CSS, but sure, actually doing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; chromeless Web page is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I mean is, since web forms are not inside a html doc (in my wildest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dreams at least) there's not &lt;table&gt; or &lt;p&gt; or CSS to help you in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; componets layout. So the layout is determined by &lt;hlayout&gt;, &lt;vlayout&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and friends.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Presentational markup is very bad for accessibility. Whatever language you
</I>&gt;<i> use, you would want it to be semantic. And luckily we have this semantic
</I>&gt;<i> language right here and already supported in several browsers... HTML. :-)
</I>

Ok. But if web apps outside the browser are to be implemented, it would
be necessary a way to attach info to the window (again, menu bar,
control bar, status bar, close button...)



&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The biggest problem is simply: How can you tell that the content you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have is trusted enough that it should be run without any of the browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; chrome?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a problem that goes beyond any SPEC. The browser chrome won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help you to determine what the app is doing behind scenes, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No but it will tell you whether the application is from www.paypal.com or
</I>&gt;<i> hostile.intranet.example.com, even if the actual content looks identical
</I>&gt;<i> in both.
</I>
Security by browser chrome doesn't seem the way to go.


&gt;<i> &gt; Security concerns are orthogonal to the web app being executed inside or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outside the browser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Security, yes, but we're talking about spoofing, and trust, and that is
</I>&gt;<i> not at all unrelated. It is in fact the major issue.
</I>
Yes, but again, this apply both tho web apps inside and outside the
browser. A complete answer, if possible, stand on several technologies
and is applicable in both cases.

I'm trying to keep open a path to WAOB. I think this feature can play an
important role in the future of this project.
