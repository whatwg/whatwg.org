</I>&gt;<i> Input precision attribute

</I>
&quot;Whole hours only&quot; is an integer. Just use that. :-)


&gt;<i> (for that matter, isn't 'expdate' just a date with lower precision?)
</I>
It's a lot easier to have a type for such a common control than to have to
have to give two attributes including a precesion.


&gt;<i> 'range' type
</I>&gt;<i> ============
</I>&gt;<i> Well, what about... er... 'analog'... 'slider'... *thinks hard* no,
</I>&gt;<i> that's about all I can come up with.
</I>
Yeah, if anyone can come up with a better name than &quot;range&quot; I'm all ears.


&gt;<i> The pattern attribute
</I>&gt;<i> =====================
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is obviously that title serves a clear purpose right now and
</I>&gt;<i> is fairly unrestrictive; I think using title for this would make people
</I>&gt;<i> (unconsciously) 'abuse' it, because they do perhaps not realize there
</I>&gt;<i> are special 'restrictions' tied to its use here. I don't think title
</I>&gt;<i> fits using it in an error message very well (unless all major UA's will
</I>&gt;<i> actually display it in the error message -you say 'may', after all-, but
</I>&gt;<i> then there's also such a thing as context which could differ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, it *is* really the proper attribute to provide extra information
</I>&gt;<i> in typically a tooltip. IMHO, title is ok. It will probably be abused,
</I>&gt;<i> but the most popular UA's actually using it in their error messages (as
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to some not using it) should help, and writing good title
</I>&gt;<i> attribute texts need a manual anyway.
</I>
I'm not sure if you're saying that I should change the spec or not! :-)

I liked the idea of using title=&quot;&quot; rather than a new attribute, because
then it would benefit legacy users too -- on browsers with no support for
pattern=&quot;&quot;, you still get the tooltip saying what the pattern should be.


&gt;<i> I also think that maybe you should leave adding the 'The expected format
</I>&gt;<i> is:' string to the page author (inside the title element). This would
</I>&gt;<i> remove all context problems among browsers using different phrasing for
</I>&gt;<i> that, and don't forget there is also a language factor to keep in mind.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Het verwachte formaat: A digit followed by three uppercase letters.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> when using the Dutch translation of my favorite browser does look a bit
</I>&gt;<i> weird. Also, take a look at this string... In high school (or maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> was basic school) I learned that after a : colon you shouldn't start
</I>&gt;<i> with a capital.
</I>
Fair point. Fixed.


&gt;<i> Maybe get it out of the error message entirely, and use something
</I>&gt;<i> automated which translates the regular expression to plain English? ;p
</I>
Uh huh. :-P


&gt;<i> required attribute applies to all controls except radio buttons
</I>&gt;<i> ===============================================================
</I>&gt;<i> What about radio buttons in sets where none of the buttons are marked as
</I>&gt;<i> checked? I really think this should apply to those as well.
</I>
The problem is, which control do you put it on?


&gt;<i> autofocus... true???
</I>&gt;<i> ====================
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's weird that you are specifically recommending to use &lt;input
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus=&quot;true&quot;&gt;, while you there is no such remark at &lt;input required&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> (or &lt;input required=&quot;required&quot;&gt; for xhtml). For that matter, &lt;input
</I>&gt;<i> autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;&gt; is also not very consistent. These are all booleans.
</I>&gt;<i> I think they should therefore also 'work' the same. I can understand
</I>&gt;<i> this not the case for autocomplete because of legacy support, but the
</I>&gt;<i> other two...
</I>
Well, checked=&quot;checked&quot; is for back compat, and autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; is for
back compat.

People complained about having to write required=&quot;required&quot; in XHTML,
which is why I made it autofocus=&quot;true&quot; instead of autofocus=&quot;autofocus&quot;.

Which do people prefer?

I've changed to to autofocus=&quot;autofocus&quot; for now, although autofocus=&quot;&quot;
(or &quot;true&quot;) would also work with the current definition.


&gt;<i> By the way, it says &quot;The following must not cause the autofocus
</I>&gt;<i> attribute to be set: &lt;input autofocus&gt;&quot;... Why not? That is exactly how
</I>&gt;<i> other booleans such as checked and required work in HTML, and (unless
</I>&gt;<i> I'm totally wrong about this) they appear to the HTML processor as if it
</I>&gt;<i> were XML with 'attribute=&quot;attribute&quot;', right? That's why XHTML needs you
</I>&gt;<i> to write attributes without value like that.
</I>
It was not allowed because actually

   &lt;foo bar&gt;

...is shorthand for

   &lt;foo something=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;

...not

   &lt;foo bar=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;

...despite what you might guess. So according to the previous definition,

   &lt;input true&gt;

...would have been equivalent to

   &lt;input autocomplete=&quot;true&quot;&gt;

Now, however, that the value is the same as the attribute name, the value
can be omitted.


&gt;<i> The help attribute
</I>&gt;<i> ==================
</I>&gt;<i> I clearly see a use for this in combination with CSS3 attribute
</I>&gt;<i> selectors, :hover, :after and generated content (kay twould be a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> a complex selector, but heh :) those are the fun ones).
</I>
I don't really see that it would be that useful even in those cases. You
want a whole URI for would effectively just be a big clumsy tooltip?


&gt;<i> Also, I see no reference whatsoever to a supposed 'hint' attribute on
</I>&gt;<i> form controls in HTML 4.01. Maybe I am blind, but it probably just isn't
</I>&gt;<i> there, so the note doesn't really make sense.
</I>
You misread it. The XForms &quot;hint&quot; attribute is &quot;title&quot; in HTML.


&gt;<i> Finally, &quot;to show that it would be trivial to add to HTML as well&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't really express a very good reason to add the attribute. If that
</I>&gt;<i> were the only reason, to show off, then it might as well not be there.
</I>
Exactly. I'm still thinking it should be removed.


Thanks for the comments!
