    My apologies if I'm working on this out of order. My intent was to 
start discussions of Web Apps 1.0 concepts before WF2 was finished so 
that WHAT WG members would have solid ideas to review by the time the 
WF2 spec was completed. If you wish, I can delay such conversations 
until a later date if it's too much of a distraction. Perhaps a good 
solution would be to create separate mailing lists for each spec...
