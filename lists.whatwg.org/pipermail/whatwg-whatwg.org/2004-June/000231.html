   No editorial comments (yet).


4.2 Change events and input events
----------------------------------

# In [DOM3EVENTS] and [HTML4], the change event is fired on a form control
# element when the control loses the input focus and its value has been
# modified since gaining focus.

   In [DOM3EVENTS] and [HTML4], the change event is fired on a form control
   element when the control loses the input focus &gt;if&lt; its value has been
   modified since gaining focus.

# This specification changes these semantics to more accurately reflect the
# behaviour expected by Web authors. Specifically, for select elements, the
# change event shall be fired when the selection is made, even if the control
# does not lose focus.

   This specification changes these semantics as they apply to select elements
   to more accurately reflect the behaviour expected by Web authors: for select
   elements, the change event shall be fired when the selection is made, even
   if the control does not lose focus.

# ... is otherwise identical to the change event. (For example, it bubbles,
# is not cancelable, and has no context information.)

   ... is otherwise identical to the change event. (&gt;I.e.&lt;, it bubbles, is
   not cancelable, and has no context information.)


4.3 Events to enable simpler dependency tracking
------------------------------------------------

# The default action of a change event on most elements is to fire a formchange
# event at each element in the form's elements,

   The default action of a change event on most elements is to fire a formchange
   event at each element in the form's elements &gt;list&lt;,

4.4 Form validation
-------------------

# With the introduction of the various type checking mechanisms

   With the introduction of the various type&gt;-&lt;checking mechanisms

# When a form is submitted, each successful control in that form, in document
# order, shall added to a temporary list.

   When a form is submitted, each successful control in that form &gt;is added&lt;,
   in document order, &lt;&gt; to a temporary list.

# Then, each control in this list shall be checked for validity, and an invalid
# event shall be fired on the control for each control that fails to comply
# with its constraints (i.e. each control whose validity attribute is non-zero
# at the start of this process) and is still a member of the form when the
# event is to be fired.

   Then, each control in this list &gt;is&lt; checked for validity and an invalid
   event &lt;&gt; fired on &lt;&gt; each control that fails to comply with its constraints
   (i.e. each control whose validity attribute is non-zero at the start of this
   process) and is still a member of the form when the event is to be fired.

# The default action is UA-specific, but is expected to consist of focusing the
# element (possibly firing focus events if appropriate), alerting the user that
# the entered value is unacceptable in the user's native language along with
# explanatory text saying why the value is currently invalid.
#
# If the reason the control is invalid is an author defined custom error then
# the message that the author provided using the setCustomValidity() method
# should be used.

   The default action is UA-specific, but is expected to consist of focusing the
   element (possibly firing focus events if appropriate)&gt; and&lt; alerting the user
   that the entered value is unacceptable in the user's native language along
   with explanatory text saying why the value is currently invalid. If the &lt;&gt;
   control is invalid &gt;due to&lt; an author&gt;-&lt;defined custom error&gt;,&lt; then the
   &gt;error&lt; message &gt;given with&lt; the setCustomValidity() method should be used.

# UAs would typically only do this for the first form control found to be
# invalid

   UAs would typically only &gt;alert the user&lt; for the first form control found to
   be invalid

# The event shall, however, still be dispatched to all successful but invalid
# controls.

   The event&lt;&gt;, however,&gt; shall&lt; still be dispatched to all successful but
   invalid controls.
