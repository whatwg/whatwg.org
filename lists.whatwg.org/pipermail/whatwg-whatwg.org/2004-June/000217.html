How would that work?

You go to gmail.com. The application has already started. You don't want
to pop up further dialogs.

Then again, I suppose gmail doesn't want to run out of the browser, so it
wouldn't need to.

The alternative would be to take the &lt;html application&gt; idea one step
further -- when you go to a URI whose markup starts with an &lt;html&gt; element
with an &quot;application&quot; attribute, you display, inline in the browser, a
short message saying that the site from such-and-such a domain wants to
run as a separate window, and should you allow it to or not.


&gt;<i> | It should also always be possible for the user to control his windows

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and no.  Many traditional apps don't afford these rights to the
</I>&gt;<i> user.
</I>
Actually, as a user, I use a system wherein I have full control over these
things. But...


&gt;<i> I see more of a need to easily kill or end an application session, that
</I>&gt;<i> would clean-up everything from an offensive app, than requiring every
</I>&gt;<i> window of an app to be able to show menus and be resizable.
</I>
The difference between Web apps and local apps is that you somewhat trust
local apps, but don't even remotely trust Web apps.


&gt;<i> The question comes down to this: should web apps have control over
</I>&gt;<i> system menu controls?  Traditional software apps are afforded this
</I>&gt;<i> control, so why not &quot;approved&quot; web apps, provided there's an
</I>&gt;<i> unoverridable, obvious way to &quot;escape&quot; from the web app?
</I>
I suppose I could see cases where letting the application appear to run as
a standalone application could make sense. The question is, how should it
appear when that application _isn't_ run as a standalone application?


&gt;<i> Or at a minimum, why not one menu bar dropdown that has a title that is
</I>&gt;<i> the name of the web app, and its own level of options that are
</I>&gt;<i> added/removed through a standard API?  The same principle seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> analogous for context menus.  The Adobe SVG viewer has a context menu
</I>&gt;<i> API:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.protocol7.com/svg-wiki/default.asp?CustomizingContextMenu">http://www.protocol7.com/svg-wiki/default.asp?CustomizingContextMenu</A> and
</I>&gt;<i> I proposed something similar for mozilla a long time ago in place of the
</I>&gt;<i> oncontextmenu event: <A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87536">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87536</A>
</I>
Oh context menus and drop down menus will definitely be supported, just
look at the number of sites that use them. The question is exactly how
should they look, basically.
