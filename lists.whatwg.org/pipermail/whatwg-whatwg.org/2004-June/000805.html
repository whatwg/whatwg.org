It isn't really clear to me that it has been used that extensively, and I
am not really aware of any testing, but ok.

I'm not sure what you mean. How would you convert a field with type IDREFS
into a form control? Or a field with type NOTATION?


&gt;<i> The third advantage is that if we can have type definition, then let say
</I>&gt;<i> we have a datatype with a long and complicated pattern used in 10
</I>&gt;<i> different places, we don't ned have that pattern in 10 different places.
</I>
If we can have a type definition, then we are including a lot more than
just XML Schema Part 2.


&gt;<i> Actually what is needed is that every datatype in XML schema can be
</I>&gt;<i> represented by a type in WF2, and not the other around. The goal is that
</I>&gt;<i> every XML element can be presented as a web form element. The goal is
</I>&gt;<i> not every web form element can be represented by an XML element.
</I>
Every XML element _can_ be represented as a type in WF2: every attribute
in XML is basically type=&quot;text&quot;.

But assuming you mean that every simple type in XML Schema should be
representable in a form, this is already possible, with the exception of
&quot;duration&quot; which is currently on the WF3 requirements list and gMonthDay,
whose definition doesn't make sense to me due to leap years:

   dateTime - &lt;input type=&quot;datetime&quot;&gt; or &quot;local-datetime&quot;
   time - &lt;input type=&quot;time&quot;&gt; [1]
   date - &lt;input type=&quot;date&quot;&gt; [1]
   gYearMonth - &lt;input type=&quot;month&quot;&gt;
   gYear - &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt; [1]
   gDay - &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt; [1]
   gMonth - &lt;select&gt; [1]
   boolean - &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;
   base64Binary - &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; [2]
   hexBinary - &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; [2]
   float - &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; step=&quot;any&quot;&gt; [3]
   decimal - &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt;
   integer, long, etc - &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; min=&quot;...&quot; max=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
   double - &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; step=&quot;any&quot;&gt; [3]
   anyURI - &lt;input type=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;
   QName - &lt;input type=&quot;uri&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
   NOTATION - &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
   string - &lt;textarea&gt;
   normalizedString - &lt;input&gt;
   token, etc - &lt;input pattern=&quot;...&quot;&gt;

[1] except for times with timezone specifiers
[2] either that or &lt;textarea&gt;, I guess
[3] except for NaN and INF.

Some of these can probably be made more accurate but the idea stands,
namely that it is possible to map almost all the XML Schema types to Web
Forms 2 right now.


&gt;&gt;<i> 3. The types in XML Schema are less readable than those in Web Forms 2.0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and HTML4. For example, where HTML4 has the type &quot;text&quot;, XML Schema has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the type &quot;normalizedString&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again I have no problem with having some legacy names, there are very
</I>&gt;<i> few anyway.
</I>
It's not only legacy names. IMHO &quot;month&quot; is a lot nicer than &quot;gYearMonth&quot;,
&quot;uri&quot; is nicer than &quot;anyURI&quot;, and &quot;number&quot; is nicer than the 16 different
kinds of number types in XML Schema.


&gt;<i> Speaking of facets, WF2 only has inclusive min and max values, while XML
</I>&gt;<i> schema has maxInclusive, minExclusive as well as maxExclusive and
</I>&gt;<i> minExclusive. So there are conditions that can be declared in XML schema
</I>&gt;<i> but not in WF2. That is another reason why we should base WF2 on XML
</I>&gt;<i> schema datatype. It is a standard that was discussed for a long time and
</I>&gt;<i> it is less likely that they would miss something.
</I>
IMHO XML Schema missed usability.

The lack of exclusive minimums and maximums was intentional. Adding
support for it at the markup level gains you very little and complicates
the language. Same with things like &quot;minlength&quot;, which are easily handled
by the pattern=&quot;&quot; attribute and don't need their own.

XML Schema also allows facets on many more types than makes sense, for
example allowing a minimum and maximum length to be specified on numbers
at the same time as minimum and maximum values.


Basically while XML Schema Part 2 might be a good type library for
describing the types of attributes in XML languages, I do not believe it
makes for a particularly good type library for Web applications and Web
forms. Trying to make Web Forms 2 into somesort of hybrid HTML/XMLSchema
superset would, IMHO, only make the resulting language ugly and harder for
authors to use.

Also, it is worth bearing in mind that most HTML authors have never heard
of XML Schema, let alone have any sort of familiarity with it. I doubt
this is going to change in the near future.
