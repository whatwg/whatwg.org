    Well, the whole point would be to have a spec that mirrors the W3C 
recommendations, et cetera. For example, say you're working on some CSS 
and you want to use a properties from a W3C spec, but you don't know if 
it's supported. You could just go to the CSS section of Web-IE6, and it 
would specify whether the properties is implemented in IE and whether it 
behaves according to the W3C specification.

</I>
    I would be surprised if Microsoft had a compiled list of how their 
browser is NOT compliant. If Microsoft has this information at all, it's 
scattered about throughout MSDN.

 &gt; However, it's probably not
&gt;<i> the best thing to do considering most proprietary IE add-ons can usually

</I>
    Even if the proprietary add-ons did something that couldn't be done 
in W3C/WHAT WG specs, would you honestly want to advertise extensions 
that you have no intention of putting into a WHAT WG spec?

    I can understand, though, if there isn't a lot of support for my 
idea. It's a lot of work with very little glory. Meanwhile, I'm working 
hard on my next specification suggestion...
