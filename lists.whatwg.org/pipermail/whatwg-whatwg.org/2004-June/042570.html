Why is the clear sign of having a listener for the event not
sufficient?  What is the basic difference.

it seems rather ridiculous to go:

chicken.setAttributeNS(null,'onrecieved','wibble')
chicken.addEventListenerNS(somethingNS,'received',etc

especially as then upon re-serialisation of the document the
onrecieved attribute is likely in the wrong state.

I'd encourage you to reconsider this.

Jim.
