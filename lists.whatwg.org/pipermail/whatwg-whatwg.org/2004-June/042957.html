Or, more simply, they could just use an existing (non WF2) UA.

The point of client-side validation isn't to ensure data integrity. As 
you correctly note, one can only ensure data integrity after the data 
reaches an environment that you control i.e. the server. Trusting data 
from the client is never a good idea and, apart from storing bad data, 
can lead to all sorts of security problems like SQL injection, buffer 
overruns and so on.

The point of client side validation is to improve the user experience. 
Trips to the server aren't free and having a delay of several seconds 
between pressing submit and finding out that you forgot to fill in a 
field or misguessed the required format is annoying. Client side 
validation also reduces server load (fewer submittals are required, less 
data fails the validity checks so processor load is reduced) and allows 
user agents to present a UI that helps the user enter data of the 
correct form.

Maybe we need some language in the spec to remind people that relying on 
client side validation to ensure valid data is wrong?
