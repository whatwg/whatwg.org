But how often would you put user-submitted data in _template_ elements?

You could do that by using a linear range then interpreting it as a power.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (which you called &quot;nice and generic, but ... much more complicated&quot;),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but extended to (for example) &quot;h,15M&quot; - which would specify a

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> complexity of this (I know I would be) to have just one general
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> purpose datetime element which can deal with all the weird
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> requirements which comes up in actual use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is the current text (using step) acceptable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Acceptable? Yes. (Hell, I'm overjoyed just having _something_ for this

</I>&gt;<i> Though this is mostly a result of not liking so many elements for what I

</I>
The problem is that with your solution, UAs have to be able to work out
how to render the UI of thinks like &quot;d,h,m,15w&quot;. I have no idea how that
would look, let alone how a UA would handle it or how to specify it in
the spec.


&gt;<i> Use case: a nature photography website with a list of national parks: asking
</I>&gt;<i> users for each &quot;what is the best month of the year to visit this park?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> input type=&quot;month&quot; is 'useless', as it includes a year (this usecase makes
</I>&gt;<i> me realize I liked it better when it was called expdate, as that name at
</I>&gt;<i> least suggested the existence of the year).
</I>
For a dropdown to pick a month, there is nothing wrong with &lt;select&gt; with
twelve child &lt;option&gt; elements.


&gt;<i> So the website will use a regular select, throwing away the semantics of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;date&quot; (with additional side-benefits like the user-agent localizing the
</I>&gt;<i> names of the months).
</I>
I'm not convinced that you'd actually _want_ the names localised in such a
case:

   What month is best to visit the park? [ Janvier |v]

I'm also not really sure I understand what benefit the semantics would
actually bring you here. So it's a month. So what? It's not like Google
(or any data mining software) or an AT (or an non-visual UA) is going to
benefit from that information, is it?
