I am taking all the input sent to this list, including my own, and
incorporating into the spec what I believe to be the solutions having the
most support and most closely adhering to the group's principles.

I don't believe anyone (apart form you) has suggested we try to get this
work &quot;rubberstamped&quot;.

We will, however, be soliciting further comments from a wider audience
once we publish a call-for-comments snapshot this weekend, as described
in our charter.

</I>
There isn't anything in the Namespaces in XML specification that states
how it should (or should not) be extended either.

</I>
WHATWG's proposed specifications are co-opting the meaning of the
&quot;text/html&quot; MIME type just as they are co-opting the meaning of the
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;</A> namespace.  There really is no difference.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I didn't mention any awful bugs, just awful things - it decides not to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; render something in response to non-WF XHTML for example!  it's awful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eh? Could you give an example URI?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take any WF XHTML document and leave off the final &lt;/html&gt; you get
</I>&gt;<i> awful behaviour in Mozilla, at least you did last time I looked, maybe
</I>
By &quot;awful&quot; I presume you mean &quot;standards compliant&quot;. The parsing change is
the one change I explicitly mentioned was different between XHTML and HTML
processing. It's amusing to note that this is the part of my e-mail that
you decided to ignore in your reply, especially in light of your
accusations that I was ignoring your feedback.

In any case, the difference in processing HTML and XHTML that you
highlight above is, as I previously mentioned, one of the few differences
in the codepaths for processing HTML and XHTML that Opera, Safari and
Mozilla have. It is not an argument for introducing _more_ differences in
the processing.


&gt;<i> they fixed this along with their mime-type sniffing spec violations.
</I>
Do you have any bug numbers for the &quot;mime-type sniffing spec violations&quot;,
or, failing that, any URIs demonstrating them?


&gt;<i> &gt; I've already explained. It's not a matter of bothering to change it. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Opera, Mozilla, or Safari add support for a feature in HTML, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically that feature will be supported in XHTML. They would have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go well out of their way to _prevent_ the new feature from working in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XHTML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really, but mozilla already go out of the way to prevent rendering of
</I>&gt;<i> non-WF docs in XHTML that they don't in the HTML code-paths, Mozilla
</I>&gt;<i> provides different DOM behaviour in XHTML to HTML, and that's just the
</I>&gt;<i> changes I know about, I don't use XHTML with Mozilla, simply because
</I>&gt;<i> XHTML has such ridiculous conformance requirements, but it definately
</I>&gt;<i> reacts differently to HTML for me.
</I>
Yes, I already explained this:

The parser has nothing to do with the majority of the body of code that
implements HTML and XHTML, and the DOM differences are inconsequential.

My point still stands.
