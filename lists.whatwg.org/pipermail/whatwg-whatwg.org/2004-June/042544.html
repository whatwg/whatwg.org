That, to me, largely describes most of the Web apps I use on a daily
basis. I browse and read bug databases, visit Google on an ad-hoc basis,
use GMail casually...

...and I &quot;tightly navigate&quot; several W3C specs repetitively and routinely,
although I would call them documents not applications.


In general I think the separation of &quot;data&quot; from &quot;code&quot; -- the separation
of &quot;document&quot; from &quot;application&quot; -- is a concept that has been outgrown
and is not really understood by users now that &quot;users&quot; involves people
who do not know the first thing about computers or the internet.

I agree that there are things Applications need that HTML doesn't provide,
of course, that's what WHATWG is all about.


&gt;<i> Of course, it's possible to build a DHTML page that's tightly navigable
</I>&gt;<i> without the user having to absorb a lot of information about images and
</I>&gt;<i> white areas. It's just not done much. And it's not possible to navigate

</I>
Not 100% sure what you mean by these. Could you elaborate? Maybe there are
some things we can do to HTML to solve these problems.


&gt;<i> The web bolt-on technique of &quot;breadcrumbing&quot; is an example of how HTML
</I>&gt;<i> is encumbered by lack of fast navigation techniques. There are no
</I>&gt;<i> breadcrumbs in WinZip or in MYOB/GnuCash/QuickBooks (for example), and
</I>&gt;<i> no need for them.
</I>
I don't really see that there is a need for HTML-based applications of
that type either. GMail for example has no breadcrumbs.

&gt;<i>From a brief look there, the only thing you do in XUL that can't be done

things to look at for Web Apps 1.0.
