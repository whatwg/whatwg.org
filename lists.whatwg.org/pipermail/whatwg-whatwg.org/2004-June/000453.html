The intention is to support all legacy browsers, including things like lynx. 
Obviously, if we can provide a 'value-add' for IE specifically, that'll be 
of benefit, but IE-only-compatibility isn't something that's brought up in 
either the whatwg charter, or the Web Forms spec. 

Suggesting that we're all trying to break backwards compatibility to force 
people to adopt Opera is laughable. I use IE, Mozilla, and lynx. Why would I 
care particularly about Opera's sales?

</I>
They might be using XHTML, but it's HTML-compatible XHTML delivered as 
text/html. *No-one* is commerically delivering XHTML as 
application/xhtml+xml. IE doesn't even support it - why would anyone bother? 

&gt;&gt;<i> You also seem to believe that everything the W3C does is automatically

</I>&gt;<i> Oh no, that's far from true, but at least they have a process, it may

</I>
Erm, WHATWG has a process too. It's documented under 'Process' in the 
Charter document at <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/charter#process.">http://whatwg.org/charter#process.</A> 

How is WHATWG 'controlled by 2 browser vendors'? I'm not a browser vendor, 
except in the limited case that I sometimes contribute to Mozilla. Ditto for 
fantasai, and yourself. 

Even the 'members' of WHATWG aren't just restricted to two vendors. Let's 
see: Brendan, dbaron, and jst could reasonably be considered to be 
'Mozilla'; H&#229;kon and Ian are 'Opera'; hyatt is 'Apple', as is Maciej, I 
think; and I don't know Dean, though I recognise his name. I suspect they'd 
all say that they're representing themselves as individuals anyway, and not 
specific companies, but even by that count, there's three, not two.

Malcolm
