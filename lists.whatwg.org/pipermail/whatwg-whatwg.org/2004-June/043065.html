I might have misunderstood how what you propose would be applicable, but I
suspect I should have been more precise with defining what I meant by
&quot;generated&quot; instead (it's not a run-once generation - it's a CMS
dynamically generated based on data from a 'higher' CMS).

Ok, a use case:
A multitude of book review sites, all hosted and administrated by the same
person, but each dealing with a clearly defined genre and run from
day-to-day by independent (and essentially untrusted) reviewers.
Within each genre, short story anthologies exist. In the CMS for a given
review site a reviewer can create information on a new anthology (title,
ISBN, price, cover image) _plus_ all the stories to appear within it (a
number usually ranging from 5 to 30, but semi-regularly dipping outside
those boundaries). _Each_ story will have general information associated
with it (author, title, first publication date, review), as well as _genre
specific information_ (Example: stories within the &quot;science fiction&quot; genre
will have information on &quot;awards won&quot;; stories within the &quot;star trek&quot; genre
will have information on &quot;spin-off series&quot; as well as maybe which &quot;main
characters&quot; the story focuses on, etc.)
One story equals one repetition block. The initial template will seed five
&quot;stories&quot;, with a big &quot;add&quot; button which reviewers will keep clicking until
they can fit in all the stories for the anthology they're reviewing.

Now if this CMS was one of a kind, there would be no problem. Unfortunately
the main administrator of these sites was lazy, so created a meta-CMS. From
within this meta-CMS, anyone who wants to create a review site for a new
genre can do so, and not only can various fields unique for the genre be
specified for short stories (which upon submission will automatically be
created in the database; and so what happens in the genre CMS is that the
fields it displays and submits are generated after they've been retrieved
from a table on &quot;genre specific fields&quot; in the database), but even initial
values for these fields can be specified. (The vast majority of &quot;star trek&quot;
short stories will be based on the &quot;TNG&quot; spin-off and focus on &quot;picard and
data&quot;, so that is what's set as the initial values for those fields in the
story template.)

So that's how I get user-submitted data (the initial values; and maybe even
pattern attributes and the like for capable users who want to more strictly
limit how genre-specific fields can be used) in template elements. 
(Such meta-CMSs are not something I create every day, but still something
I've created more than once.)


Anyway, I can live with the non-breaking zero-width space character
solution, but a way to exclude all attributes of a certain type in one go
would still be very welcome.

Sander

P.S. Section 3.7.1 of the current draft still speaks of the repeat
&quot;element&quot;.
