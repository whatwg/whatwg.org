Good point. What value do people prefer? Midnight on Thursday January 1st
1970? (the zero point for time_t) I've used that for now. It's arbitrary,
but better than 0000-01-01, since then you might have to take into account
the start of the gregorian calendar and all that nonsense.


&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that with your solution, UAs have to be able to work out

</I>&gt;<i> I think)
</I>
Is it? People were asking to be able to format their fields.


&gt;<i> plus assuming that you meant w for week of the year, and m for minute
</I>&gt;<i> (various languages use different conventions, so here I went for the
</I>&gt;<i> easiest one) :), I think it would look roughly the same as &lt;input
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;local-datetime&quot; step=&quot;9072000&quot;&gt;, except without a year identifier.
</I>
But the concept of &quot;week&quot; is meaningless without a year. So is day, for
that matter.


&gt;<i> Are there any other people with feelings about this? Am I the only one
</I>&gt;<i> who believes that a lot of situations will be encountered where the six
</I>&gt;<i> datetime types currently available will prove to be too limited, and
</I>&gt;<i> that I'd really prefer one type=&quot;datetime&quot; capable of handling it all?
</I>
I've been looking around the Web, and while I agree there are edge cases
that aren't dealt with, I don't think they are common enough to require
the extra complexity that you are proposing.


&gt;&gt;<i> For a dropdown to pick a month, there is nothing wrong with &lt;select&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with twelve child &lt;option&gt; elements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. And yet, if it's all the same to you, I'd much rather write &lt;input
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;datetime&quot; format=&quot;m&quot;&gt; then the 14 lines for the select; particularly
</I>&gt;<i> as I can just see the client for that site coming back a few months later
</I>&gt;<i> with a request to increase the specificity to week. 52 lines of &quot;jan 01 -
</I>&gt;<i> 07&quot; don't make me happy, where &lt;input type=&quot;datetime&quot; format=&quot;w&quot;&gt; does. :)
</I>
&lt;input type=&quot;week&quot;&gt; is even easier. :-)
