Yes, but the scope of the two are rather different, one is in a
general purpose scripting language, where the dependency on the
accuracy of such information is purely up to the application
developer.  Whereas in WF2 it's raised to be something where it's
absolutely critical that the user and client are in agreement about
the time and timezone - how many times on usenet do you see people who
in the UK with their clocks 9 hours wrong, but appearing right to
themselves as they are in a +9 timezone?

This requirement simply isn't workable on the web.

Right, what rendering language does this XBL have that gives us this
complete control over how things look?  Why would we use the rather
hobbled to be backwards compatible WF2 proposals in an XBL
environment?

&gt;<i> I'm not convinced that we need this on the date controls themsevles. Those

</I>&gt;<i> to control that further at the format level?
</I>
Because designers feel the need to place some control on what the user
sees, they like to be able to say &quot;20em&quot; for the width of an input
control, once the rendering is no longer in their hands, they no
longer know if 20em is appropriate to show the entire date in a
particular format.

Jim.
