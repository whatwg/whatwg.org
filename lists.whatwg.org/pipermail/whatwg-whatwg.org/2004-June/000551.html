Most authors are completely incapable of even remotely understanding RDF.
At least, most of the authors I talk to. Then again, based on the
www-validator mailing list, many authors have trouble understanding
entites, let alone RDF or namespaces. These are part of WHATWG's target
audience.


&gt;&gt;<i> IE6 is only a concern because compatibility with IE6 is a concern of Web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authors. The main motivation of WF2 (and all of WHATWG) is authors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, Then I think it would be good if you could get some Authoring
</I>&gt;<i> Tool companies on board, they'll have useful things to say I'm sure.
</I>
This is an open mailing list. Anyone can post. (For what it's worth, I'm
aware of at least one authoring tool implementor on the list.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; no-one's yet explained how HTML 4 and XHTML 1 really create a migration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; path, could you explain now perhaps?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XHTML 1.0 appendix C claims to describe such a migration path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but it doesn't - so I guess you're conceding there isn't one -
</I>
That's a W3C issue, really.


&gt;<i> why not just an HTML vocabulary though (then you don't need to pollute
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces you don't control)
</I>
Because to UAs that implement both, there is no difference between HTML4
and XHTML1.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, but you've still not told us the roadmap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Publish WF2 snapshot this weekend.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Iterate WF2 until we agree it is as good as we're going to get it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   without real-world experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Create WF2 test suite.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Create WF2 experimental implementations, to obtain implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Update the spec based on implementation feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Submit WF2 to standards organisation as basis for HTML extensions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great, any idea how long this might take?
</I>
None whatsoever. &quot;When it's ready.&quot;
