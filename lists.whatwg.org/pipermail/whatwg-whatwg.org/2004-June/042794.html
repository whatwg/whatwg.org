E-mails sent at the wrong time. Alarms going off at the wrong time.
Backups launching at the wrong time.

So? How does that translate into a problem for WF2's datetime?

Which OS?

</I>
Sucre. Section 15.9.1.7 of ECMA-262 Edition 3 Final.


&gt;<i> Also the summertime behaviour for different locations than the current
</I>&gt;<i> one, which is another requirement for useful use of the datetime
</I>&gt;<i> control.
</I>
That is part of knowing what timezone you are in, and in practice is
dealt with by the OS. The UA simply queries the OS.


&gt;&gt;<i> While certainly not as pleasant as a nice UI with a pretty clock, it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still possible for users to enter the datetime format if their UA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't support it and does not have JavaScript enable for the page to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help them. So it is backwards compatible, just not very pretty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you provide an example page using the datetime control Perhaps a
</I>&gt;<i> copy of <A HREF="http://timetables.oag.com/man2/">http://timetables.oag.com/man2/</A> in WF2, and how that will work.
</I>
That site doesn't use an equivalent of the datetime control. It has the
equivalent of a date control followed by a &lt;select&gt; with some times and
some vaguer times.

Here is a snippet of what a page for a multinational company's intranet
site might look like if it used WF2:

   &lt;form action=&quot;new-event&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;label&gt; Event title: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot;&gt; &lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;label&gt; Start time: &lt;input type=&quot;datetime&quot; name=&quot;t_start&quot;&gt; &lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;label&gt; Edit time: &lt;input type=&quot;datetime&quot; name=&quot;t_end&quot;&gt; &lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;li&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Continue...&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;


&gt;&gt;<i> (I don't think extending the definition to allow any timezone is a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea, given that this would increase the implementation burden on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server-side implementors to a point where they are highly likely to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make mistakes.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Server side implementors already deal with all of this regularly, and

</I>&gt;<i> when they can already use well understood UI's that can do it, without

</I>
Yeah, it's a fair point. Users could, in legacy UAs, use any time zone
specifier (or none, maybe, with the server making an educated guess) that
they wanted. WF2 UAs would always be able to give a time zone though (and
can thus always convert it to UTC) since the user would provide the time
using his local timezone.
