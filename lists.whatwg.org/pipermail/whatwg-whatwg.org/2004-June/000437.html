It's just as much tag-soup as XHTML or WF2 (when sent as text/html) 
IE supports &quot;namespaces&quot; in HTML, it not only supports them, it
documents how to use them.

Remember to catch all the comments, you've missed parts of them, maybe
you could get some of the other WG members to respond, they don't seem
to be participating much, and I thought one of the motivations for
doing this as 7 random blokes was for speed?

&gt;<i> I

</I>&gt;<i> are yours. I've been going through them in chronological order. I believe
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently dealing with comments from last Tuesday or so.
</I>
And the ones you missed from before then?  (answering only half a posting)

Jim.
