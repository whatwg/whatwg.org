I understood the whole point of this was graceful degradation, so why
would it be a concern to me, I think it's unlikely I'll be using WF2
for many years (since I don't want to degrade to my most important
platform, it's inefficient) but I'd like to make sure I can keep
viewing content, and who knows I might be wrong.

&gt;<i> &gt; Oops, it looks like I left out a NOT from the sentance, it's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flawless, it still turns up both false positives, and false negatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that to compliant UAs a &quot;conditional comment&quot; is just a comment, any
</I>&gt;<i> false positive is a bug. How can you get a false negative?
</I>
When using it to identify IE, you can use conditional comments to both
fail to identify IE when it is in use, and identify it as IE when it's
not - they're false positives and false negatives.  Also please
remember you cannot talk about condtional comment differences being a
compliance issue, conditional comments are not outlawed in ECMA 262.

&gt;<i> &gt; I also don't really see why the fact it violates the spec here is a bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing, but adding innerHTML violations are okay -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who said they were ok?
</I>
Oh right,  so you think I'll have an easy job getting it removed from
Mozilla then as it's non-conformant?  If not, and it's fine for
&quot;conformant UA's&quot; to include that, then it's just as fine for everyone
else to include other logical extensions.

&gt;<i> No, they're not. They all get returned as strings, not at all following
</I>&gt;<i> the principles outlined in the section you cited.
</I>
Since they're not validating UA's there's no doctype reading going on,
in any case, my example page didn't provide a DTD, and so string was a
perfectly acceptable choice IMO.

Jim.
