IE6 is what everyone uses. We have to use it as a baseline model. 

&quot;The truth is that the real Web, the Web that authors write for, is the
Windows IE6 Web.&quot;

&gt;<i> same adoption curve that &quot;bleeding edge&quot; tech has.  As I see it WHAT is

With mobile phones nowadays they generally can *just* about do XHTML
Basic. That means that if we build from XHTML there will always be
something for those devices to fall back on (compatibility). If you come
up with an new web application framework then you are going to blow
those devices out the water (incompatibility).

What are you working on now in Microsoft? :)

&gt;<i> 6) Bundled behaviors of this form also bypass the CSS mechanism that I

I find it works better than ever with XML.

&gt;<i> in most new web browser technologies in favor of some form of NON-STANDARD

</I>
What non-standard styling mechanism?

&gt;<i> universe, and it shows up everywhere; there is no reason when dealing with  
</I>&gt;<i> XML that we should be accessing a non-XML text file that defines in a  
</I>&gt;<i> complex parsing manner a limited set of stylistic attributes that then  
</I>&gt;<i> rely upon a difficult to use cascading model. Binding behaviors into the  
</I>&gt;<i> model seems to me the height of poor planning.
</I>
Don't know much about this case. Do you have a test case? URI? Seems a
little bizarre.

Banned? I have never heard of a person being banned from an open mailing
list, unless perhaps that person spammed. I like to think as
technologists we are all able to filter out (and in) email accordingly.

There is a lot of points in your mail. If you want people to address
your points better consider splitting your email.

Best wishes,
