How strongly do people feel about this? The advantage of having it be
&quot;expdate&quot; is that it is immediately clear what the field is. I couldn't
actually think of another use case for it when I wrote this up.


&gt;<i> Validation is something that can be done by script, but could benefit
</I>&gt;<i> from a standard browser interface. I would like to see the 'validate'
</I>&gt;<i> event on form do the 'alerting the user that the entered value is
</I>&gt;<i> unacceptable' action in all cases, even manually calling .validate()
</I>&gt;<i> from script.
</I>
Yeah I was thinking about that. Ok, done.


&gt;<i> autofocus would also be good, if it's meant to only focus when the
</I>&gt;<i> window itself has focus, ie. not steal focus from other windows. This
</I>&gt;<i> can't currently be done from JS so I assume this is what it's for.
</I>
Note added to this effect.


&gt;<i> Things I'm not especially keen on, OTOH:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - repeating form controls. Seems a *lot* of added complication for
</I>&gt;<i>      something that can currently be done pretty easily with DOM
</I>&gt;<i>      (cloneNode etc.).
</I>
Having done it, I assure you, it's a lot easier if you don't have to. :-)


&gt;<i>      The name-[]-hacking bit is especially nasty,
</I>&gt;<i>      a way of including literal square brackets seems to be missing,
</I>
Yes. Better suggestions are welcome. :-)


&gt;<i>      and id duplication inside the template seems not be catered for.
</I>
Just put [template] into the IDs, so they get changed as well.


&gt;<i>    - &lt;output&gt; seems pretty redundant, providing no functionality that
</I>&gt;<i>      can't currently be done just as well using styled readonly inputs
</I>&gt;<i>      or plain spans.
</I>
Functionality, no, but it provides for better semantics. It also makes the
script a bit nicer; instead of having to hack around with text nodes you
can just change &quot;value&quot;.


&gt;<i>    - the FormImplementation method of remoting seems redundant. DOM
</I>&gt;<i>      Level 3 LS and XMLHttpRequest already cover this ground, I would
</I>&gt;<i>      prefer to see browsers standardise on either of these.
</I>
Both XMLHttpRequest and DOM3LS are significantly more complicated.


&gt;<i>    - user-modify. I am VEHEMENTLY opposed to the IE model of being
</I>&gt;<i>      able to arbitrarily edit non-form elements. This proposal has
</I>&gt;<i>      all the disadvantages of contentEditable, without the advantage
</I>&gt;<i>      of actually being IE-compatible.
</I>
Yeah, I agree. The Web Controls spec hasn't yet really been looked at.


&gt;<i> I would be particularly interested in sending DOM Mutation Events down a
</I>&gt;<i> wire to synchronise DOMs, especially if the client end could send
</I>&gt;<i> addEventListener requests to the server end to specify what it was
</I>&gt;<i> interested in. That's not strictly web application-related, but it'd be
</I>&gt;<i> cool.
</I>
Well, you control the server side, so just define whatever you want as
your API and then use &lt;event-source&gt;:

   &lt;event-source src=&quot;dom-watcher?mutations-on=foo,bar&quot;&gt;
