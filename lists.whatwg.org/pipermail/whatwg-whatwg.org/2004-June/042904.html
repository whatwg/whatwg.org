It seems we're talking about different sorts of conditional comments,
I'm talking about JScript ones not they HTML-esque version also
available to IE.  The problem with those is that they're not available
in IE4 which also does the attribute reflection, that may not be a
problem in other peoples perception of course, but it is in mine.  I
don't know much about failure scenarios of these comments though, so
couldn't comment on their suitability otherwise.

</I>
I'd be happy with them including extensions, but this isn't what
they're doing, they're trying to modify the actual specifications.  if
they simply said &quot;we support this&quot; then that would be fine, but
they're trying to make out it is a standard and actually part of XHTML
etc. is the problem I have.

&gt;<i> Not a forwards-compatible choice if that attribute was defined as a
</I>&gt;<i> boolean or a number, though, is it.
</I>
But 100% compatible if it's defined as a String - and little is lost
if a conversion is forced, in ecmascript it would take moments to
perform the conversion, and would likely be happening automatically in
most uses in any case.  (if (el.chicken==1)  works the same...)
