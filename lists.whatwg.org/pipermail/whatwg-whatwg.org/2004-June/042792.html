As I pointed out, no, it doesn't:

# Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have their
# scripting features disabled) are exempt from supporting the events and
# DOM interfaces mentioned in this specification. Other aspects of this
# specification that are defined in terms of an events model must still
# act as if events were supported.

This is a completely open mailing list, anyone can subscribe if they wish
to contribute. I happen to know there are several accessibility experts on
this list; they are all welcome to post their opinions and feedback will
be taken into account.


&gt;<i> requiring scripting is simply not possible, the AT's are simply not able

</I>
That is a bug with the assistive technologies. There is nothing about
scripting that intrinsicly makes it non-accessible, it is the APIs that
scripting interact with that can have accessibility problems.
