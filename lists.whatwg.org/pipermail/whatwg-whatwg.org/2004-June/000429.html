A misconfigured UA is always a possibility, but given the problems that
would already be present with the UA (and indeed the entire platform) if
the time zone was incorrect, I fail to see how that is a particular
concern for Web Forms 2.

Support for this is already required by ECMA262.

Not sure what you meant by that.

While certainly not as pleasant as a nice UI with a pretty clock, it is
still possible for users to enter the datetime format if their UA doesn't
support it and does not have JavaScript enable for the page to help them.
So it is backwards compatible, just not very pretty.

I don't really see a better way to do it, although I'm open to
suggestions.

(I don't think extending the definition to allow any timezone is a good
idea, given that this would increase the implementation burden on
server-side implementors to a point where they are highly likely to make
mistakes.)
