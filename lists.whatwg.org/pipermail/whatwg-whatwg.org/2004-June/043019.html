In my research, I found that while the exact order of all the controls was
often unavailable (which is what spawned the whole [id] stuff in the first
place), the order of values of a particular field were all available. That
is, most often the data would be returned in the form of a hash (or
equivalent structure) with the names in an order different than the
submission order, but the values for each name given in the submission
order. As in:

   real submission:
      fieldB=10
      fieldB=20
      fieldA=1
      fieldB=30
      fieldA=2

   resulting data structure:
      fieldA = 1, 2
      fieldB = 10, 20, 30

If you have the order of the values, then you need just include a single
hidden control:

   &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;order&quot; value=&quot;[row]&quot;&gt;

...and then when you get the data back, process it in the order given by
the field named &quot;order&quot;. This is what I do in the demo:

   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/demos/repeat-01/">http://whatwg.org/demos/repeat-01/</A>


&gt;<i> Proposal #1:
</I>&gt;<i>    For each instantiation of the template, the instantiation itself
</I>&gt;<i> contains an implied successful form control with the name
</I>&gt;<i> (templateId).(index).position, eg (for the example in section 3.1 of the
</I>&gt;<i> draft) &quot;order.1.position&quot;. The index here is the same index used for
</I>&gt;<i> other form controls in the record. The value of this form control is the
</I>&gt;<i> position that this record has been moved to by 'up' and 'down' buttons.
</I>
This is pretty much what happens in the XML submission model.


&gt;<i> Another issue: I didn't see a way to initially populate the *values* of
</I>&gt;<i> form fields in repetition blocks. If you're manipulating an order form,
</I>&gt;<i> it's quite possible, if not likely, that the form has some initial data
</I>&gt;<i> that needs to appear. It's not clear from the draft whether it's
</I>&gt;<i> permitted to actually fill in the contents of the initial state of
</I>&gt;<i> repetition blocks (if it is, that raises all sorts of other questions,
</I>&gt;<i> like what if the initial content doesn't match the template) but if it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't, how do you initially populate the form fields?
</I>
Just include the repetition blocks with the values prefilled. There is
nothing special that happens if the repetition block is different than the
template.
