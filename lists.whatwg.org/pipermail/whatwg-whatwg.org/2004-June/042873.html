</I>can you outline your objections to HTCs? i am in touch with the IT 
department of a huge company that has invested heavily in them (100,000 
user intranet). although they have had some problems, it's my 
understanding that they are not insurmountable. the main problem is 
microsoft's lack of documentation. nor is there much information 
available through web development communities. i've found them a pain to 
test with but once settled they are fine. page bloat can be avoided by 
implementing correct caching. but i am interested in particular problems 
that you have experienced.
