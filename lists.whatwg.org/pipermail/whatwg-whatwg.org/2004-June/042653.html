XForms is not tag soup, though.

This is getting off-topic (and probably would be better dealt with on
www-forms) but I don't really understand how sending an XML document
(potentially containing XForms or SVG) as text/html and then having it be
interpreted as XML in some way can in any way be considered conformant.

Don't worry, I will be dealing with all comments in due course. I
currently have about 98 outstanding comments to deal with, many of which
are yours. I've been going through them in chronological order. I believe
I'm currently dealing with comments from last Tuesday or so.

</I>
I am aware of several people who tried to bring up these issues on the
XForms internal mailing list during XForms development who were dismissed
as not knowing what they were talking about or not getting &quot;the big
picture&quot;, sadly.

But that is way off-topic for this list.
