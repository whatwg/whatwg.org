Oh sorry, I misread your example, I think this is equivalent to the
fieldset proposal, just using a new element, rather than an attribute
on fieldset, I don't see anything wrong with it either, Last I read
Ian was &quot;looking at it&quot;, but heard nothing since.

&gt;<i> I have a similar sales entry form I developed for my intranet where the user is

If you can &quot;search&quot; reliably to it, then do that, you just need a text
box and a search mechanism, perhaps divide it into categories, or
similar, but navigating a drop down list with 1000's of elements in is
generally not very usable (keyboard users often can use it reasonably
efficiently, but we shouldn't sacrifice the work in.) If you look at
most UI guides they don't suggest using combo boxes for more than you
have to scroll to get to, scrolling is too difficult a function AIUI.
