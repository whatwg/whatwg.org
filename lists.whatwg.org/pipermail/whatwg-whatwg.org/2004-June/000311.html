<PRE>
Thinking about my earlier reply to this post reminded me of something I 
tried in the mid - nineties. My client at that time made railway ticket 
vending machines. These generally had a PC inside, gubbins for handling 
cash and something to code and print magnetic tickets. The PC generally 
had a standalone application to generate the GUI, etc.

I tried a thin client approach - running Netscape and a web page with 
plenty of forms and Javascript to do the GUI, selection by touch screen.

Anyway, the point is this. The devil was in the details, this particular 
devil was getting data in and out of the coin system, ticket printer, etc.

If Web Apps had some hook in it to do this sort of communication by 
passing XML fragments to peripherals, it could have a bright future in 
this kind of application.

Regards,

Pete.
