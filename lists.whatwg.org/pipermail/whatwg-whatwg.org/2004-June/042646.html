I really don't like this. It might be the only solution though.

How about this? We say that all attributes are processed, except those
starting with the two character string &quot;[]&quot;, which just have their two
leading square brackets removed and are otherwise untouched.

Then any unsafe attributes can just have &quot;[]&quot; put at the front.

Ugly, but at least we don't have a weird attribute and a list of magical
attributes that get processed...


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> More on repetition: I find the existence of the &lt;repeat&gt; element next to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the repeat attribute with numerical value to be confusing. I suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dropping the latter. (Comparing against an older draft, I vaguely
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> suspect this already being the plan, with the necessary editing simply
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not having been done yet.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure what you meant by this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You specify both repetition blocks (3.2.2: &quot;An element ... with the repeat
</I>&gt;<i> attribute ..., with the attribute's value equal to an integer&quot;) and initial
</I>&gt;<i> repetition blocks (3.5.4: &quot;The repeat element ... is used to insert
</I>&gt;<i> repetition blocks without having to explicitly copy the repetition template
</I>&gt;<i> markup in the source document.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> I just now grokked that the former might exist so that you can (dynamically)
</I>&gt;<i> set the &quot;repeat&quot; attribute on an existing element to turn it into a
</I>&gt;<i> repetition block, but the benefit of setting an attribute versus replacing
</I>&gt;<i> a node seems very small to me, and the existence of two ways to create a
</I>&gt;<i> repetition block both confusing and wasteful.
</I>
The existence of the numeric &quot;repeat&quot; _attribute_ is largely because when
you hit the &quot;Add&quot; button, there needs to be a way of distinguishing the
repetition blocks from just random other blocks. That is, authors won't
generally use the numeric &quot;repeat&quot; attribute (it isn't mentioned in the
intro, for instance).


&gt;&gt;<i> [&lt;repeat&gt;]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I at least oppose the idea of removing it; no matter how odd or
</I>&gt;<i> unconventional (though really, it's not that bad - it's just a
</I>&gt;<i> placeholder for content to be added at run-time), the benefits of its
</I>&gt;<i> existence are huge.
</I>
Ok.


&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe we should drop &quot;precision&quot; altogether and just have &quot;step&quot;, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make it apply to all the numeric and date/time types.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's throwing away the ability to specify logarithmic numbers. Not
</I>&gt;<i> used very often admittedly (at least in my experience), but the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of them is very welcome nonetheless.
</I>
We can add them back if there really is a good use case. I haven't seen
one, to be honest. I originally added it because it fit into the model
easily. It no longer fits into the model easily.


&gt;<i> I'm personally leaning toward the earlier suggestion of a list of
</I>&gt;<i> datetime-part values &quot;&quot;y,m&quot; for expdate, &quot;y,w&quot; for week, &quot;y,m,d,h,M&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (which you called &quot;nice and generic, but ... much more complicated&quot;),
</I>&gt;<i> but extended to (for example) &quot;h,15M&quot; - which would specify a precision
</I>&gt;<i> of 15 minute increments for a time consisting of hours and minutes. I
</I>&gt;<i> think authors will be more than willing to put up with the complexity of
</I>&gt;<i> this (I know I would be) to have just one general purpose datetime
</I>&gt;<i> element which can deal with all the weird requirements which comes up in
</I>&gt;<i> actual use.
</I>
Is the current text (using step) acceptable?
