</I>
Right, so not much use at all really then, seen as we generally have
timezone dependant dates for almost all internet use.  I want to know
when my train arrives in London if I leave today.  Seen as we can't
have the legacy clients deal with the timezone issues, and we add a
dependance on the client knowing the UTC offset of the user I think
it's all rather over-specified and un-implementable.

[flight example]
&gt;<i> Indeed. For this use, the &quot;time&quot; type is available.
</I>
So we cannot use the datetime control for travel sites?  Rather
inconvenient is it not?

&gt;<i> Truncated representations don't seem like they would require much in the
</I>&gt;<i> parser. You just set anything you haven't read yet to zero.
</I>
You seem to be mis-remembering ISO 8601, the truncated representations
don't default to 0.  Maybe a quick refresher course, perhaps you could
assign an Action to one of the other working group, they don't seem to
be doing much work on the spec.

&gt;<i> &gt; week: one of the more popular uses of weeks in the UK is the tax week,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this of course doesn't work as an ISO8601 week, could the week widget be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generalised so it can be used for these other definitions of week?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly; how would you do it? (I don't know enough about the UK Tax week
</I>&gt;<i> to know exactly what needs generalising.)
</I>
The date that is week 1.

&gt;<i> &gt; Why are +0 etc. invalid?  The MUST restriction on the UA to not submit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; numbers in invalid formats is required why, surely SHOULD is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It has to be &quot;MUST&quot; so that servers are guarenteed to always be able to
</I>&gt;<i> parse the result. Why would it be &quot;SHOULD&quot;?
</I>
Because of the over-validation suggestions I've talked about before on
the list, servers cannot rely on the format being returned, since
servers cannot rely on a Web Forms 2.0 client.

&gt;<i> &gt; Will there be any methods for a form requesting values not directly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; representable in your required submission format (such as 1/3)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not in this version, but what did you have in mind?
</I>
A method for requesting numbers not representable in your format... 
as to how it might look, I have no idea yet, I've not really thought
about it.

&gt;<i> Yeah. I've dropped &quot;tel&quot; for now.
</I>
Good, 1 down, how many more features do I have left?

Jim.
