Which is trivially solved everywhere, by asking for a time in the
context of UTC, often with help saying what the equivalent times are
in various timezones, this isn't a problem that I've seen need
solving.

It's not a server side solution in use today, it's a client-side
solution, the questions have to be asked differently, you can't ask
the same question unless you require the users to enter in UTC, which
I hope you'll agree is ridiculous.

Does anyone else think UTC submission is a good thing that they'll use
regularly other than Hixie?

Jim.
