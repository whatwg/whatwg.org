Could you address the other points About re-serialisation of the DOM
leading to something radically different from what was intended (the
attribute should only be there if there was also an event listener
after a re-serialisation and parse it wouldn't be there.)

I realise you have a large job Ian going through all these comments,
but you often miss out some element of each post, I really do think an
issue tracker is important.

Jim.
