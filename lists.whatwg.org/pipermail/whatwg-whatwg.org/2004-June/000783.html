Web Apps 1.0 requirement.

Not exactly sure what you mean, could you give us an example?

This is hard. ;-) Would be nice though. Noted for Web Apps.

That's a UA thing, really. Nothing is stopping UAs from allowing you to
insert tabs, e.g. by pressing ctrl-tab or something like that.


&gt;<i> The other thing I was curious about, is if there is some way, in between

</I>
The list of nicely written requirements is at the top of each spec in a
section called &quot;Requirements&quot;. For example, for Web Apps 1.0, you can see
the list here:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#requirements">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#requirements</A>

In addition, each spec has a long list of requests that I haven't really
done through yet, in a comment at the bottom of the file. For Web Forms
2.0 the list is about 70 lines long and is reasonably neatly typed up.
It currently basically consists of the requirements we'll have for Web
Forms 3.0.

For Web Apps 1.0 the list is some 250 lines long but is a complete mess
because I keep cutting and pasting stuff from everyone's e-mails into the
list without really paying much attention to the format.

Some of the suggestions don't make much sense, or are very vague, and when
I come to going through the list I'll blink twice and ignore them; others
are just a few words to remind me of a discussion I had with someone.
There are also some that are simply URIs pointing to blog entries or
mailing list posts (some might even be W3C confidential mailing list
posts). So don't expect to necessarily understand them all. :-)
