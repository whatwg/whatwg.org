&quot;&lt;X&gt;&quot;???

    I was referring to how it would be presented in the spec. I don't 
expect we can enforce a specific use in any way. However, I don't think 
such enforcement is needed. See below.

&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;input&gt; will still be preferred by webmasters that don't want to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>include fallback. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can neither dictate nor predict such things. 
</I>&gt;<i> Authors are going to use it however they like (not to mention that 
</I>&gt;<i> their WYSIWYG editor will do things that they are not even aware of) 
</I>&gt;<i> ;)
</I>
    True, but if you were used to using &lt;input&gt;, would you use a tag 
with  then same attributes but a longer name and a required closing tag 
to do the exact same thing? Especially if the specs say to use &lt;input&gt; 
in simple cases? Take a look:

|<i> &lt;input type=&quot;date&quot; name=&quot;date1&quot; value=&quot;2005-02-10&quot;&gt;
</I>
|<i> &lt;icomplex type=&quot;date&quot; name=&quot;date1&quot; value=&quot;2005-02-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/icomplex&gt;
</I>
    So it's not a certainty, but it's pretty close. As for the editor, 
they can simply use &lt;input&gt; by default and give a warning before saving 
if &lt;icomplex&gt; has no contents. (Can we require contents??? My first 
guess would be no, but maybe someone knows more than I.)

&gt;&gt;<i> Let me know if there are any other concerns to address. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not the prettiest tag name :)
</I>
    Other suggestions are welcome. Some possibilities:

  * &lt;inputcomplex&gt;
  * &lt;inputc&gt;
  * &lt;cinput&gt;
  * &lt;ci&gt;
  * &lt;input1&gt;
  * &lt;ic&gt;
  * &lt;ilegacy&gt;

&gt;<i> The .elements problem is not solved, since the indexes will still be 
</I>&gt;<i> different depending on what type of UA you deal with. It is more 
</I>&gt;<i> common to access elements by name but in this scenario we are dealing 
</I>&gt;<i> with legacy content possibly including older scripts that do not use 
</I>&gt;<i> getElementById et al.
</I>
    Well, one solution would be to provide an optional attribute that 
can exclude &lt;icomplex&gt; from the .elements collection:

|<i> &lt;icomplex domcloak=&quot;true&quot; name=&quot;hideMe&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- Contents. --&gt;&lt;/icomplex&gt;
</I>
    I'm not sure I like that solution though, and I'm almost certain Ian 
won't like it. Another solution would be that &lt;icomplex&gt; would never be 
included in the .elements collection at all. That seems like a better 
solution, and since the WF2 DOM extensions depend on DOM2 and 
getElementById is well supported. So there's no issues of being able to 
get a specific &lt;icomplex&gt; element on WF2 UAs.

&gt;<i> A DOM scripting issue if you want to add a new HTML element: what do 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers do if you do document.createElement('icomplex')?  Will any
</I> &gt; browsers choke and throw errors?

    This isn't actually a problem specific to &lt;icomplex&gt;. Elements such 
as &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;output&gt; and any other new elements we introduce could 
have this problem. If this can't be addressed, it may be a serious 
problem for any WHATWG specification.

&gt;<i> If an element is created, can the script reliably detect if the
</I> &gt; created element is the element type they expect?

    /me shrugs and offers this:

|<i> if (myIcomplexElement.type) // Does the object has a .type property?
</I>
    Yeah, assuming an unrecognized element doesn't automatically have 
properties that aren't on most elements, I'd say that's pretty safe. 
Remember, though that IANAJSG. (Guess the acronym!) ;)

    Is it just me, or are there holes in the Javascript and DOM specs 
that you can drive a truck through?
