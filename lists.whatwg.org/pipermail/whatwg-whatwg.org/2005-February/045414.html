</I>&gt;<i> Matthew. I encourage you to send your proposals to this mailing list. The 
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail you sent with your proposal is still in my queue, along with all 
</I>&gt;<i> the other WA1 and WF2 proposals that have been sent and have not yet 
</I>&gt;<i> received technical replies. It will be given the same consideration as all 
</I>&gt;<i> the other proposals, including Tantek's and anything else I (or whoever 
</I>&gt;<i> the spec editor is at that time) come across.

</I>&gt;<i> There is no conspiracy here.
</I>
    Give it up! I know it was you and Tantek flying over my house in a 
black helicopter last night trying to reprogram me with radio waves!

&gt;<i> Please relax.
</I>
    I find it's usually unwise to say this to someone who is truly upset. ;)

&gt;<i> The only reason I suggested 
</I>&gt;<i> contacting Tantek is because I know he's been working on this topic, that 
</I>&gt;<i> he has some very good ideas, and that he is welcoming feedback. I would 
</I>&gt;<i> have thought that working with him on a proposal would have been more 
</I>&gt;<i> productive than working on independent proposals. However, that was merely 
</I>&gt;<i> a suggestion and was not meant to imply that other proposals would be 
</I>&gt;<i> ignored or given a different level of consideration.
</I>
    Glad we cleared that up then.

&gt;<i> In particular, please don't think that I will be swayed by flashy 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics, fancy markup, diagrams, or wiki-based development.
</I>
    I never meant to imply this. I was trying to avoid a situation where 
a section of the spec was being developed outside of WHATWG in a way 
that gave people unequal opportunity to express their views and opinions.

[Snip!]
&gt;<i> Also, progress on WHATWG specs is going at its own rate, and is not 
</I>&gt;<i> controlled by progress on external drafts or proposals.
</I>
   That's what I wanted to hear.

</I>&gt;<i> sure what the point is. As far as I'm concerned this mailing list is the 
</I>&gt;<i> most convenient way for me to handle input. I wouldn't monitor a wiki (or 
</I>&gt;<i> probably even look at it) if one was created.
</I>
    I've had several situations where people didn't understand the ideas 
I was presenting because they were spread out over several emails. 
Often, someone would confuse a concept I was advocating with an 
older-but-similar concept I had abandoned. Take the following concepts, 
for instance:

  * &lt;format&gt;
  * &lt;dateinput&gt;
  * &lt;date&gt; (as an input control)
  * &lt;idate&gt;
  * &lt;icomplex&gt;
  * &lt;dataentry&gt;

    They're all closely related to each other. In fact, &lt;dataentry&gt; is 
pretty much the same as &lt;icomplex&gt;. If there was a simple wiki I could 
use to maintain my ideas about the general topic, I could simply post 
the URL at the beginning of a message rather than having to hunt down 
all my messages and giving a long explanation of what parts were relevant.

    If I can find a way to set up a wiki for WHATWG, though, you'll be 
the first to know.

&gt;&gt;<i>Actually, you gave a specific time you'd be working on it...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;I'm not planning on touching the relevant sections of WA1 until 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Tantek's drafts are much more stable.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I spoke ambiguously, my apologies. What I meant was that by the time I 
</I>&gt;<i> next touched those sections, I expected Tantek's drafts to be much more 
</I>&gt;<i> stable. (In particular, I am currently prioritising folding HTML4, XHTML1, 
</I>&gt;<i> and DOM2 HTML into WA1, adding the section on the Window interface, and 
</I>&gt;<i> speccing the new interfaces for networking and messaging. There is a LOT 
</I>&gt;<i> of work there.)
</I>
    Oh, I know you're busy, and that it often takes you a long time to 
get to some portions of a spec. I objected to what I thought was you 
saying you wouldn't even look at anything until Tantek's draft ready, 
which appears to be a miscommunication at this point.
