I left that one because the term &quot;URI&quot; is more likely to be understood 
than &quot;IRI&quot;, and that sentence is aimed at explaining a conformance 
criteria to authors. (Note that that sentence is not itself a conformance 
criteria but a statement.)


&gt;<i> 2.12. The datalist element and the list attribute
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It could be that the UA has listed some IRIs as well though I may be
</I>&gt;<i> nitpicking here.
</I>
Again, the occurances here are either in explanatory text or in examples, 
which are themselves non-normative by definition.


&gt;<i> 2.16. Extensions to the form element
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure about this. If it is an empty string, should it really be
</I>&gt;<i> relative to the base URI? I can remember a discussion in Bugzilla about
</I>&gt;<i> same-document references where there still isn't a conclusion about
</I>&gt;<i> this. (Among other things with regard to this.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or does this update the RFC in question?
</I>
The Bugzilla discussion to which you refer was regarding fragment 
identifiers; there are none in this case.


&gt;<i> 6.1. Filling select elements
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why &quot;URI or IRI&quot;? IRI covers both. Same for other sections where this is 
</I>&gt;<i> used. (See for another example 6.2.)
</I>
Again, because the term &quot;URI&quot; is much more likely to be understood than 
&quot;IRI&quot;. Mentioning both means that the conformance criteria is exact while 
still making the intent clear.


&gt;<i> A. XHTML module definition
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of attribute can only contain URIs where it would make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> allow IRIs.
</I>
AIUI, we are restricted by XHTML M12N here.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Also, I think WF2 should refer to RFC3986 instead of RFC1738 since 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the former updates the latter. RFC3986 is an internet standard and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; obsoletes various other documents as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd updated all the relevant reference, I think. Did you see some I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering why you were pointing to RFC1738 as well as pointing to 
</I>&gt;<i> RFC3986. However, as you explained on IRC RFC3986 only updates the 
</I>&gt;<i> specification it does not obsolete it.
</I>
Indeed.
