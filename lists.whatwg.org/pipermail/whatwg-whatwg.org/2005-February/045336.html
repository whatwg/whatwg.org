    I could be convinced to drop inheritance if it's shown that it 
creates significant implementation problems, but unless someone can 
clearly communicate the problems involved, I still believe any potential 
feature removal should occur during the implementation phase of the spec.

    On a slightly unrelated note, I just realized a short time ago that 
the Microsoft sabotage scenario could happen just as easily if &lt;idate&gt;, 
or any part of it, were left out of the spec as it would be if it were 
included as-is. All Microsoft would have to do is implement flawed 
non-inheritance support (to mess up my version of &lt;idate&gt;), or implement 
my version in its entirety for either Ian's position or yours. So I 
don't think manipulating the markup is going to keep Microsoft from 
screwing us if it so desires...
