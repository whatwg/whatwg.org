Yes. Do UAs need to know the scope of the &lt;address&gt;? What could they do  
with this information? (If it is important, then we could use a class name  
or a new attribute for this IMHO.)

&gt;<i> This would make it

</I>
&lt;address&gt; has been around forever. Yet no UA has done anything useful with  
its semantics as far as I know. That suggests to me that the use-case is  
not a real-world one. Isn't it better to make &lt;address&gt; more general so  
that its semantics is more like how most authors use it so that it becomes  
a convenient styling hook for authors?

&gt;<i> Creating an &lt;author&gt; element might help resolve that problem for
</I>&gt;<i> new content, but then agents would have to sniff content to work out
</I>&gt;<i> what sort of content was under investigation. A better alternative might
</I>&gt;<i> be a new element &lt;contactinfo&gt;, which is a more general name than
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;address&gt; and doesn't make old content more ambiguous.
</I>
I don't think it's a good idea to invent a new element when the use-case  
is so weak that most authors don't bother using it and no UA have  
implemented anything useful with it. I'd rather drop &lt;address&gt; altogether.
