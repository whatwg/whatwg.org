I think device independence and accessibility are worthwhile goals.  
Semantic markup and separation of content and style are not essential  
in themselves but just a means of pursuing the other goals.

People also need to believe that they benefit from thinking on a more  
abstract level.

Well, to the extent most people keep semantics implicit and only  
think about presentation explicitly, reconciling &quot;natural&quot; with  
asking them to think differently is a problem.

I agree. Do you have a plan on how you are going to convince  
developers to take the risk of incurring the cost of developing a new  
kind of tool which may not succeed with users?

Anyway, HTML5 needs to be realistic considering the immediate  
evolvability of existing tools.

P.S. This should not be considered a pro-&lt;font&gt; message. I think the  
&lt;font&gt; element should be dropped and the style='' attribute should be  
allowed on all elements.
