I'm not sure I can follow. The &quot;uneditable template to be filled in&quot; you
mention sounds like a form to me. Surely a form can specify whether some
field must contain a single paragraph or allows several? Surely when such a
form needs to be filled out, it is up to the author of the form to decide
whether or not to leave room for &quot;anything else&quot; at the end of (but still
*part of*) the form?

Again, I may be misunderstanding what you're saying, but I would think that
you could simply choose to let people enter either &quot;anything&quot;, or force them
into a specific format, through a form. When you choose the latter, it is up
to the author of the form to define whether that form contains one or more
areas that allow &quot;anything&quot;.

&gt;<i> I would hate to have to implement an

</I>
Do they? People structure strings of text all the time, by splitting it into
paragraphs, into chapters, etc.

I'm aware that some people simply have never learned to work with structure,
but then that will come out in *anything* they do. Nothing much to do with
Web publishing as such. (Although I think a &quot;structural editor&quot; may well in
fact help them learn to get comfortable with structures -- that someone has
never learned something doesn't necessarily mean they're incapable of
learning it.)
