That's a feature, not a bug.

Authorial intent is a myth. Documents don't have to be rendered like the 
author intended, nor should we expect them to be.  We don't read Homer 
like Homer intended, but we still read him, well more than a thousand 
years later. (For one thing Homer actually intended that people listen 
to the poems, not read them.)

This is not to say that I don't think it's useful to define a standard 
tree structure for documents. It is useful. However the benefit of this 
exercise is not in maintaining authorial intent. That's tilting at 
windmills, and will never succeed no matter what we do.
