</I>
You already have the code for adding new inputs, because you fire it 
when you press Enter after entering a single address. As for the rest:

var addresses = textbox.split(/[:,]\s*/);

&gt;<i> Also, what Thunderbird does is not always desirable: having 50+, 150+ 
</I>&gt;<i> emails takes too much screen space (too many rows). 
</I>
This is what scrollbars are for. A web page is not a physical device. If 
you think the user will get tired scrolling past the 150 addresses they 
just added, put the address list into a &lt;div style=overflow:scroll&gt; with 
a height of approximately 10x the height of a text box.

&gt;<i> Keeping all of them 
</I>&gt;<i> in a single input is a lot more compact.
</I>
And a lot harder to find a particular one and delete it.

&gt;<i> Isn't it easier, after all, to have a single simple &lt;input type=emails&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> ? Parsed only once when the form is submitted (either server-side, or 
</I>&gt;<i> client-side, it does not really matter).
</I>
I don't think it's as easy to use or edit, and it makes it harder for 
the browser to do things like automatic address completion from a dropdown.

&gt;<i> JS+DOM work. The final result is basically allowing not only a single 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;input type=emails&gt; (as I suggested), but multiple such fields, as many 
</I>&gt;<i> as the user wants - while all the work is done by the web author, not by 
</I>&gt;<i> the UA.
</I>
Not all the work. They have &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot;&gt; as a building block. 
But yes - webmail implementations are free to come up with their own 
excellent ideas about the best way to handle 150 email addresses in the 
UI. I'd call that a feature, not a bug.
