<PRE>Mike,

XTech hadn't been on my radar, but after checking it out I will
definitely be in attendance. I would be happy to join in on a panel or
host a BoF if you think that would help. Let me know

&gt;<i> I am the Dir of Product Development at Skyhook Wireless where we have
</I>a
&gt;<i> Wi-Fi Positioning System - think GPS, but software-only and uses
</I>&gt;<i> Wireless APs instead of satellites. We have been working on developing
</I>a
&gt;<i> plugin for Firefox that gives a website access to the user's location
</I>&gt;<i> via javascript. User's can control access to this information at the
</I>&gt;<i> domain level in much the same way they control cookies and popups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have been successful in exposing it through the Javascript DOM and
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to start talking with standards bodies about coming up with a
</I>&gt;<i> standard implementation to make location-aware browsing common
</I>&gt;<i> functionality at the browser level.

Are you planning to attend XTech 2007 in Paris? I ask because I've
had a session on the XTech program that relates in part to
enabling web-app access to locating-sensing features on devices:

  Web-app access to &quot;sensors&quot; on mobile devices, May 15 at 2pm
  <A HREF="http://xtech.expectnation.com/event/1/public/schedule/detail/195">http://xtech.expectnation.com/event/1/public/schedule/detail/195</A>

It's part of the &quot;Ubiquitous Web Day&quot; that Dave Raggett is
chairing there.

  <A HREF="http://xtech.expectnation.com/event/1/public/schedule/topic/7">http://xtech.expectnation.com/event/1/public/schedule/topic/7</A>

Anyway, I've been really interested in getting related discussion
going on some mailing lists prior to that (which is what you've
already done here :) and in making the actual session an
interactive one with a lot of participation from the audience, and
in having as much further discussion around it at the conference
as we can manage. I've already been talking with a few others, and
I think we can manage to get a good number of interested people to
show up, so if you can make it to XTech for that, I think it'll be
a good opportunity to start to talk face-to-face with others and
share ideas about this.
