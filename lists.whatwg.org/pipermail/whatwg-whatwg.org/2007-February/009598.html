Agreed.

Well, not *think* as in &quot;make it hard&quot;, no :) It needs to be as 'natural' as
possible[*]. Still, part of what people consider &quot;natural&quot; is what they're
used to. I don't think we should be too afraid to offer an authoring tool
that works a little different from what people are used to (yet no more than
necessary). People used to not be used to cars and telephones, but they did
get used to them and find them very natural now.

[*] ATAG 1.0 makes some good points about this: don't bother the user
unnecessarily. But it doesn't conclude to just let the user mess about. The
challenge is to subtly guide the user, without getting in his way.

Depends on the user. The spectrum ranges from those who only care about
structure and semantics (perfectly happy with &quot;black text on a grey
background&quot;) to those who only care about looks. The majority is somewhere
inbetween.
