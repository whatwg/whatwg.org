</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, people have lots of fun trying to find the correct markup for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The general problem is that people want to number (or, less commonly, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bullet) series of items that are already in multi-element structures, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such that &lt;ol&gt;/&lt;ul&gt; cannot be used. Here, if numbering were not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required, you would arguably be using &lt;dl&gt; (since each section is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; full definition of the instruction given in its first line), but &lt;dt&gt;s 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't be numbered automatically solely with HTML. The same applies to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a formal dictionary where definitions &lt;dd&gt; for each term should be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; numbered. And the same applies to a table where each row &lt;tr&gt; should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be numbered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So DL is the biggest problem here, I guess. Since DT can occure multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> times and DD as well. Perhaps we should introduce DI, like XHTML 2.0 to 
</I>&gt;<i> take away this problem and a lot of other problems with regard to 
</I>&gt;<i> styling DL elements?

</I>&gt;<i> Introducing this element affects the content model of DL. There are

</I>&gt;<i> require it, or have a mixed content model where you only allow the one 
</I>&gt;<i> or the other depending on your needs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I would vote for requiring it. A simple example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;di&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;dt&gt;CSS

</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;dt&gt;etc
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;dd&gt;et cetera
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/di&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;/dl&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of DI is that it allows grouping of definitions and 
</I>&gt;<i> therefore takes away the importance of element order. It also has a 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic advantage to group these elements. From a structural point of 
</I>&gt;<i> view it is very difficult for current DL element constructs to see which 
</I>&gt;<i> (DT, DD) are bound together as a single entry.

</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;/bar&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> And now you tell me if you would have known that &lt;bax/&gt; and &lt;baz/&gt;

Given how few people spoke in favour of &lt;di&gt;, both here and in general 
(e.g. in response to XHTML2), I have decided to leave it out for now.

</I>
Indeed, the &lt;di&gt; element doesn't seem to be semantically needed -- it 
doesn't tell us anything about the markup that we didn't already know.

Fixed in HTML5.

Agreed.
