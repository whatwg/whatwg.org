<PRE>The title may seem silly: tables are completely different from 
definition lists; the only similarity is that they are both block 
elements.

Well, on the presentational level, I could not agree more. But when you 
come to think to the semantics, I am not so sure.

What follows is pure speculation from me -- not a request for any 
change, just some thoughts I would like your opinion on. Because I 
truly wonder if &lt;dl&gt; and &lt;table&gt; are different enough. Maybe this is 
just theoretical (practicability/compatibility may render the whole 
idea useless), but I would still like your opinion, especially 
considering the amount of talented people on this list.

With no further ado, my reasoning:

A definition list (&lt;dl&gt;) provides a relationship between an important 
element (&lt;dt&gt;) and a less-important one (&lt;dd&gt;). One might argue the 1:1 
ratio is not necessary; One can think of two &lt;dt&gt; for one &lt;dd&gt; or, more 
often, one &lt;dt&gt; and, say, three &lt;dd&gt;.

In a table, the same relation exists between &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;. Also, both 
&lt;dl&gt; and &lt;table&gt; are block elements (which, IMHO, doesn't matter when 
we talk of semantics).

There is not a mere redundancy here: &lt;table&gt; is able to represent more 
complex relations than &lt;dl&gt; can
&#8226; &lt;caption&gt; has no equivalent in &lt;dl&gt; (LH didn't made it in HTML&#160;3.0)
&#8226; &lt;dl&gt; may only have one relationship (&lt;dt&gt; to &lt;dd&gt;, even with multiple 
&lt;dt&gt;/&lt;dd&gt;) whereas &lt;table&gt; may have two (maybe more, but I am not sure)

            TH TH TH

     TH     TD TD TD
     TH     TD TD TD
     TH     TD TD TD

(I don't know the English name for such a table; Double entry table?)

I'm sure there is detail I could find, but I'll stop here.

Oh, one more thing: we used to bash tables, because they were used for 
layout instead of pure &#8220;tabular data&#8221; (layout table vs. Excel-like 
tables) but I think there is a &#8220;gray zone&#8221; inbetween that is currently 
addressed by &lt;dl&gt;. And everything &lt;dl&gt; does, table can do it better on 
a semantic point of view.


So, this is my thinking. It certainly is full of misconceptions and 
oversights, would you be so kind as to give your impressions on it?
