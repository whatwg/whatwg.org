FWIW, I wouldn't expect that from a &quot;validator&quot;. A validator only checks for
validity, not for &quot;good behaviour&quot;[*]. If a spec allows an empty &lt;p&gt;, than an
ampty &lt;p&gt; is valid. That's not to say that a tool cannot warn of such things,
just that it doesn't fall under &quot;validation&quot;.

I believe HTMLTidy has something to offer on this terrain. iCab also has.
Other than that I can't think of one right now. There is certainly room for
improvement in this area. A tool that provides this sort of feedback would be
helpful for web publishers, and for teachers/students. Authoring tools could
have this sort of thing built-in, to help people avoid the sort of ugly
markup you mention (without bothering the user unnecessarily -- an empty &lt;p&gt;
can safely be stripped silently, for instance).

For a standalone tool, all you can do really is return errors/warnings. But
when you embed such a tool in an authoring system, you could make things
user-friendlier by having the authoring tool silently take action based on
output of the 'validator'. For instance, silently stripping empty &lt;p&gt;
elements is unlikely to be a problem. With this approach users wouldn't have
to be bothered with at least some category of problems and are thus more
likely to accept erros/warnings that do require the user to take action.

For a teaching situation OTOH you probably should be confronted with any and
all errors and warnings explicitly.
