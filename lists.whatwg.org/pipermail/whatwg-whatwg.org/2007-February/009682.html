True, but it also has the disadvantage of possibly conflicting
with other evening events that others may end up planning.

Anyway, given that it seems like you and Ryan will both be able to
make it on that Tuesday and hopefully Dave Raggett can -- and that
we can also recruit some other interested people at the Ubi Web
Day sessions that Tuesday -- I've gone ahead and asked Edd if we
can do set it up on that Tuesday, and he's given a provisional OK
for it. He suggests scheduling it for 6:00pm to 7:30pm so that we
can head out to dinner after if we want.

Anybody else on the list thinking about maybe attending the session?
