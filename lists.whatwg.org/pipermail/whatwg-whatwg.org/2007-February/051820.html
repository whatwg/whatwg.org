This project sounds very interesting, although I'm a bit dubious about
the benefit of a single WYSIWYG view rather than a series of views
presenting how a given document skin would look in different devices
(e.g. mobile view, screen reader view, console view, magnifier view,
desktop view). This would help with the problem Chaals mentioned of
people continuing to view the web as essentially a visual medium. Is
this project of yours a public project? Are there more details about
what you're trying to do somewhere?

Perhaps the best metaphor for the separation of content and styles is
&quot;skinning&quot; or &quot;theming&quot;, a concept almost as popularly familiar as
WYSIWIG itself.

</I>
Yes I suspect moving away from single view to workflow models would help
here.
