Following is a conversation from #whatwg on freenode.

&lt;csarven&gt; if anyone would like to explain the `m` element further, i'd
appreciate it. couldn't get much info out of the whatwg Archives

&lt;zcorpan&gt; you use it to mark text

&lt;csarven&gt; 'mark' as in making the location of the content more
significant then the rest?

&lt;zcorpan&gt; not sure what you mean with the location

&lt;csarven&gt; where the mentioned text is in the document.

&lt;csarven&gt; to me it seems to be more of a presentational issue then
having a semantic meaning behind it

&lt;zcorpan&gt; there may be different reasons behind why you want to mark
or highlight a piece of text

&lt;csarven&gt; for instance?

&lt;zcorpan&gt; one reason might be to highlight search terms, another may
be to mark errors in the document, or things you should remember
specifically

&lt;csarven&gt; in those cases the marked text has no extra meaning other
then how it would be viewed or interpreted. &quot;highlighting does not
change the reading of the text when you're reading straight through,
it just helps you find the bits you should pay attention to.&quot; -

&lt;csarven&gt; in that sense, why not `span` with a class?

&lt;csarven&gt; im trying to understand this better (not arguing with you) :)

&lt;zcorpan&gt; span with a class is longer to type :)

&lt;csarven&gt; that i can't argue :)

&lt;mpt&gt; Like on those pissantly annoying &quot;Welcome Google user! You
searched for xyz&quot; pages, where xyz is highlighted

&lt;csarven&gt; the 'text' though has no extra meaning. `m` seems to handle
a presentational issue. like i was wondering, why not `span` with a
class which can cover numerous cases similar to highlighting

&lt;zcorpan&gt; i don't think highlighting is presentational

&lt;csarven&gt; how should `m` be treated under Lynx?

&lt;zcorpan&gt; it could have a different text color and you could have a
shortcut key to jump to the next &lt;m&gt; element

&lt;csarven&gt; as opposed to a predefined class name 'marked' that does just that?

&lt;zcorpan&gt; i don't think &lt;m&gt; is any better than &lt;span class=marked&gt;
except that the former is shorter

&lt;csarven&gt; but thats introducing a new element for a very narrow usage
especially where it has no extra meaning. given the idea that the
reading of the marked text is no different then any other text on the
page, i fail to see why a new element is necessary where `span` with a
class can handle this scenario. i also can't come to terms with a new
element being introduced because `span` with a class is too long in
comparison to `m`. :)
