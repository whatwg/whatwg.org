The &quot;flawed&quot; conclusion flows out of &quot;Follow Your Nose&quot; advocacy, and  
is not flawed if one takes &quot;Follow Your Nose&quot; seriously.

It seems to me that the positions that RDF applications should &quot;Follow  
Their Nose&quot; and that link rot is not dangerous (to RDF) are  
contradictory positions.

That link rot hasn't been a practical problem to the Semantic Web  
community suggests that applications don't really Follow Their Nose in  
practice. Can anyone point me to a deployed end user application that  
uses RDF internally and Follows Its Nose?

(For clarity: I'm not saying that link rot is dangerous to RDF apps.  
I'm saying that taking the position that it is not dangerous  
contradicts Follow Your Nose advocacy. I think &quot;Follow Your Nose&quot; is  
impractical on the Web scale and is alien to naming schemes used in  
technologies that have been successfully deployed on the Web scale  
[e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM and Unicode].)

&quot;Cache&quot; means that you can still go find the original and the cache is  
just nearer.

&gt;<i> If a cached copy of the vocabulary cannot be found, it can be re- 
</I>&gt;<i> created from scratch if necessary.
</I>
Do any end user applications that use RDF internally provide a UI for  
installing local re-creations?

It's not the same. A Java classloader doesn't &quot;Follow Its Nose&quot;. A  
classloader will find classes in my classpath even if there weren't a  
server at sun.com. Likewise, <A HREF="http://sun.com/foo">http://sun.com/foo</A> RDF predicates would  
continue to work in applications that don't &quot;Follow Their Nose&quot; even  
if the server at sun.com disappeared.

However, if the com.sun.* classes were renamed to com.oracle.* and the  
com.sun.* copies withdrawn in a new release of a library, other  
classes that have been compiled against com.sun.* classes would cease  
to load. This is analogous to applications programmed to recognize <A HREF="http://web.resource.org/cc/*">http://web.resource.org/cc/*</A> 
  predicates not recognizing <A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/ns#*">http://creativecommons.org/ns#*</A>  
predicates. (You can't Follow Your Nose from the former to the latter,  
BTW.)
