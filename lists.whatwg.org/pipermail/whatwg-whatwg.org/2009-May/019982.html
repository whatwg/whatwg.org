<PRE>So I got a chance to review the latest changes (Hurray for the tracking
view!: <A HREF="http://html5.org/tools/web-workers-tracker?from=139&amp;to=140">http://html5.org/tools/web-workers-tracker?from=139&amp;to=140</A>).
Do we still need the concept of a &quot;protected&quot; worker? We define what a
protected worker is, but we don't actually reference that definition
anywhere in the spec anymore, since active needed/permissible status is
entirely driven by the existence of active/inactive documents.

Overall it looks good, and I think the steps taken to remove GC behavior
from the spec will greatly facility implementation. However, I did have a
question about the definition of orphaned workers and &quot;active needed&quot;
workers:

A worker is said to be an *active needed worker* if any of the
Documentobjects in the
worker's Documents
&lt;<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#the-worker-s-documents">http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#the-worker-s-documents</A>&gt;are fully
active.

*Closing orphan workers*: Start monitoring the worker such that no sooner
than it stops being either an active needed
worker&lt;<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#active-needed-worker">http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#active-needed-worker</A>&gt;or a
suspendable
worker &lt;<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#suspendable-worker">http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#suspendable-worker</A>&gt;, and no later
than it stops being a permissible
worker&lt;<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#permissible-worker">http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#permissible-worker</A>&gt;,
*worker global scope*'s
closing&lt;<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#dom-workerglobalscope-closing">http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/#dom-workerglobalscope-closing</A>&gt;flag
is set to true.


It sounds like the worker is guaranteed to not be orphaned as long as the
parent window is active, even if the user agent is able to identify that the
worker is not reachable, which might be a stronger guarantee than was
intended. Perhaps the spec already has an implicit assumption that UAs are
able to do whatever they want with unreachable items?
