<PRE>Is your concern that an ill-behaved app could leak ports (since obviously an
ill-behaved app could leak ports anyway just by stuffing them in some
array), or is it that a well-behaved app can't release ports? Still need to
review the new spec in detail, but from previous conversations I'd assumed
that calling MessagePort.close() on either end would allow the ports to be
freed - perhaps we should clarify the language in the spec to state that the
strong reference is only in place for *entangled* ports.
The alternative is to force applications to keep explicit references to all
of their ports, which seems unwieldy and also worse given that there's now
no way for applications to determine whether a given port is entangled or
not (since .active exposes the behavior of the garbage collector).
