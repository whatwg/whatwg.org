<PRE>One alternate approach to providing this support would be via shared,
cross-domain workers (yes, workers are my hammer and now everything looks
like a nail :) - this seems like one of the canonical uses of cross-domain
workers, in fact.

This would be potentially even more secure than a simple shared database, as
it would allow the application to programmatically control access from other
domains, synchronize updates, etc while allowing better controls over access
(read-only, write via specific exposed write APIs, etc).

</I>&gt;<i> applications access, no doubt requiring UA permission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally the origin site could also have control over providing an update to

</I>&gt;<i> but potentially by simply providing a new database at the previous location
</I>&gt;<i> which was checked periodically for a new modification date). I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> whether it would ideal to tie this in to the caching API (perhaps deleting
</I>&gt;<i> the database reference could also cause it to be re-downloaded and also
</I>&gt;<i> force the database to be re-created). Perhaps the cache API could also be
</I>&gt;<i> optionally shared with other domains as well, allowing them to ensure their
</I>&gt;<i> application was working with the latest data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe custom protocols will also play into this well, as there could be
</I>&gt;<i> a number of uses for operating on the same data set while linking to it in a
</I>&gt;<i> way which is application-independent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Thanks to Kristof Zelechovski for helping me distill the essence of the
</I>&gt;<i> idea a bit more succinctly and more in line with HTML 5's progress to date.)
