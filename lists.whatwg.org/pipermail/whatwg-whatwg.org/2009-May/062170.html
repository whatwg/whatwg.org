I find that 'news' pages on bands' and products' websites often seem to
be like this -- but I don't have links to any current ones (almost by
definition: because the sites don't offer feeds, I don't follow them, so
can't remember them).

Here are some from the past:

* <A HREF="http://warmscotland.org/">http://warmscotland.org/</A>

  News and updates were manually added to the top of the list.  The
  existed for a specific short-term campaign and I'm not sure any
  dropped off the bottom before it was over.

* <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20051024131550/http://www.leeds-camra.com/Blog/">http://web.archive.org/web/20051024131550/http://www.leeds-camra.com/Blog/</A>

  Content was manually added to the top.  Once a month the content was
  moved to an archive page.  (This blog no longer exists.)

* <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20060515220924/http://www.beccyowen.com/">http://web.archive.org/web/20060515220924/http://www.beccyowen.com/</A>

  Content appeared at the top; I'm not sure if it ever disappeared from
  the bottom, until the entire site was redesigned.  (The redesign
  features a feed.)

* <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20070827182615/www.arianeandzarina.com/blog.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20070827182615/www.arianeandzarina.com/blog.html</A>

  Content was manually added at the top; I'm not sure if it ever
  disappeared from the bottom, until the entire blog was abandonned.
  The 'subscribe' link is to get e-mail updates.
