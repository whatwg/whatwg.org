</I>&gt;<i> cost of switching (for example HTML vs. XHTML). My personally judgment 
</I>&gt;<i> is that we're not past the point of no return on data embedding.

</I>&gt;<i> verge of picking a single winner, and the players seem willing to 
</I>&gt;<i> experiment with different options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There are not dozens of other serializations of RDF.

The point I was trying to make is, I'd rather put my time into something 
that exists now, than have to watch the wheel re-invented. I'd rather 
see semantic metadata become a reality. I'm glad that you personally 
feel that companies will be just peachy keen on having to support 
multiple parsers to get the same data.

On the HTML WG side, I will never support microdata, because no case has 
been made for its existence.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The point is, people in the real world have to use this stuff. It 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> helps them if they have one, generally agreed on approach. As it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is, folks have to contend with both RDFa and microformats, but at 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> least we know these have different purposes.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> From my cursory study, I think microdata could subsume many of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use cases of both microformats and RDFa. It seems to me that it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> avoids much of what microformats advocates find objectionable, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> provides a good basis for new microformats; but at the same time it 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems it can represent a full RDF data model. Thus, I think we have 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the potential to get one solution that works for everyone.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not 100% sure microdata can really achieve this, but I think 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making the attempt is a positive step.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It can't, don't you see?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Microdata will only work in HTML5/XHTML5. XHTML 1.1 and yes, 2.0 will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be around for years, decades. In addition, XHTML5 already supports RDFa.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supporting XHTML 1.1 has about 0.00000000001% as much value as 
</I>&gt;<i> supporting  text/html. XHTML 2.0 is completely irrelevant to the Web, 
</I>&gt;<i> and looks on track to remain so. So I don't find this point very 
</I>&gt;<i> persuasive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't think you'll find that the world is breathlessly waiting for 
HTML5. I think you'll find that XHTML 1.1 will have wider use than HTML5 
for the next decade. If not longer. I wouldn't count out XHTML 2.0, 
either.  And in a decade, a lot can change.

&gt;&gt;<i> Why you think something completely brand new, no vendor support, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drummed up in a few hours or a day or so is more robust, and a better 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option than a mature spec in wide use, well frankly boggles my mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't evaluated it enough to know for sure (as I said). I do think 
</I>&gt;<i> avoiding CURIEs is extremely valuable from the point of view of sane 
</I>&gt;<i> text/html semantics and ease of authoring; and RDF experts seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> think it works fine for representing RDF data models. So tentatively, 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any gaping holes. If you see a technical problem, and not 
</I>&gt;<i> just potential competition for the technology you've invested in, then 
</I>&gt;<i> you should definitely cite it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't think CURIEs are that difficult, nor impossible no matter the 
arguments that Henri brings out.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am impressed with your belief in HTML5.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One other detail that it seems not many people have picked up on yet 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is that microdata proposes a DOM API to extract microdata-based info 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from a live document on the client side. In my opinion this is huge 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and has the potential to greatly increase author interest in 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> semantic markup.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not really. Can do this now with RDFa in XHTML. And I don't need any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new DOM to do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The power of semantic markup isn't really seen until you take that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> markup data _outside_ the document. And merge that data with data 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from other documents. Google rich snippets. Yahoo searchmonkey. Heck, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even an application that manages the data from different subsites of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I respectfully disagree. An API to do things client-side that doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> require an external library is extremely powerful, because it lets 
</I>&gt;<i> content authors easily make use of the very same semantic markup that 
</I>&gt;<i> they are vending for third parties, so they have more incentive to use 
</I>&gt;<i> it and get it right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure, we'll have to disagree on this one.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now, it may be that microdata will ultimately fail, either because 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it is outcompeted by RDFa, or because not enough people care about 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> semantic markup, or whatever. But at least for now, I don't see a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reason to strangle it in the cradle.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Outcompeted...wow, what a way to think of it. Sorry, but competition 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has no place in spec work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With due respect, you're the one who brought competition into this 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion by saying there can only be one winner. I don't really 
</I>&gt;<i> think that's true, in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK, fine.

Thanks for the discussion.

Shelley
