The latter.

</I>
The conformance requirement I cited is clearly not limited to the case  
where the port is entangled to another port. Unless that clears the  
owner - it didn't seem that was the case in my reading of the spec.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The alternative is to force applications to keep explicit references

</I>&gt;<i> that there's now no way for applications to determine whether a  
</I>&gt;<i> given port is entangled or not (since .active exposes the behavior  
</I>&gt;<i> of the garbage collector).
</I>
I'm not sure it is all that unwieldy to keep references to ports you  
are actually using, it seems like many program structures would lead  
to this naturally. However, I would find it sufficient if there were  
some explicit way to say that a port you are using may now be  
collected (such as calling .close() on it).

Regards,
Maciej
