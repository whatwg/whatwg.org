There are critical differences between HTML and video, such that this
analogy has never worked well.


&gt;<i> I am also aware that browsers that don't implement fragments will also show

</I>
This is not a standardisation problem, but an adoption problem. In a
transition phase there may be user agents that cannot deal with
fragments, but ultimately that will not be the case any more.


&gt;<i> Given both of these, I tend towards using # as a focus of attention; &#160;if
</I>&gt;<i> trimming is desired, the server should probably do it (maybe using ?).
</I>
Just making sure I understand your suggestion correctly: I assume you
are saying that both # and ? would be able to only deliver the data
fragment that relates to the given specified temporal fragment, but
you are suggesting that by using &quot;#&quot; the user agent is being told to
present the context, while by using &quot;?&quot; the user agent would focus
attention on the fragment only. Is that what you're saying or am I
misunderstanding?

I'm asking because that has not been the consensus in the media
fragments WG as of today and if there is a discussion to be had, we
should take this back to the mf WG. It is an interesting view and has
actual technical implications - e.g. &quot;#&quot; could deliver the raw data
without requiring an adapted container since it could be assumed that
the core decoding environment is already set up - an adapted container
is however required in the &quot;?&quot; case since the &quot;?&quot; creates a new
resource.

Silvia.
