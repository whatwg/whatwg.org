</I>&gt;<i> to illustrate it with a example, inspired by the original use-case:
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say someone's marking up a collection of iguanas (or cats, or
</I>&gt;<i> even CDs, doesn't really make a difference when illustrating this
</I>&gt;<i> issue), making a page for each iguana (or whatever) with all the
</I>&gt;<i> details for it; and then making an &quot;index&quot; page listing the maybe 20
</I>&gt;<i> iguanas with their name, picture, and link to the corresponding page.
</I>&gt;<i> Adding micro-data to that &quot;index&quot;, either with RDFa or with Ian's
</I>&gt;<i> microdata proposal, would involve stating 20 times in the markup
</I>&gt;<i> something like &quot;this is the iguana's picture; this is the iguana's
</I>&gt;<i> name; and this is the iguana's URL&quot;. It would be preferable to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to state something like &quot;each (row) &lt;tr&gt; in the &lt;table&gt; describes an
</I>&gt;<i> iguana: the &lt;img&gt;s are each iguana's picture, the contents of the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;a&gt;'s are the names, and the @href of the &lt;a&gt;'s are the URLs to their
</I>&gt;<i> main pages&quot; just once. If I only need to state the table headings once
</I>&gt;<i> for the users to understand this concept, why should a micro-data
</I>&gt;<i> consumer require me to state it 20 times, once for each row?
</I>&gt;<i> Please note how such a page would be quite painful to maintain: any
</I>&gt;<i> mistake in the micro-data mark-up would generate invalid data and
</I>&gt;<i> require a manual harvest of the data on the page, thus killing the
</I>&gt;<i> whole purpose of micro-data. And repeating something 20 (or more)
</I>&gt;<i> times brings a lot of chances to put a typo in, or to miss an
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, or any minor but devastating mistake like these.

Well, he didn't quite *ignore* it - he did explicitly call out that
requirement to say that his solution didn't solve it at all.  He also
laid down the reason why - it's unlikely that any reasonable simple
in-place metadata solution would allow you to do that.  You either
need significant complexity, some reliance on language semantics (like
tables can rely on their headers), or moving to out-of-band
specification, likely through a Selectors-based model.

The last is likely the best solution for that, and is even easier to
implement within Ian' simplified proposal.  I don't see a good reason
why that can't advance on a separate track, as (being out-of-band) it
doesn't require changes to HTML to be usable.

I floated a basic proposal for Cascading RDF[1] several months ago,
and someone else (I think Eduard?  I'd have to check my archives) did
something very similar.
