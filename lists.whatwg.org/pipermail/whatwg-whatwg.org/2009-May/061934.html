</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;hgroup&gt; affects the document structure, &lt;header&gt; does not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That explains _how_ they are different (as does the spec), but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _why_ it is like that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; More specifically:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Are there significant cases where &lt;header&gt; needs _not_ to imply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;hgroup&gt; ?  Consider wrapping an &lt;hgroup&gt; inside every &lt;header&gt; ;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   how many places has that broken the semantics?  I could believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   that most of the cases where a pager header appropriately contains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   multiple headings they are subtitles rather than subsections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The semantic that authors seem to want from an element named &quot;header&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;All the top matter of my page before the main content&quot;. That could
</I>&gt;<i> include headers, subheaders, navigation, asides and almost anything
</I>&gt;<i> else.
</I>
It could.  But most of the above have no effect on the outline
algorithm.  In practice, how often do current &lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
sections contain headers of multiple sections, without those nested
sections being separately wrapped in their own &lt;div&gt;-s (or similar,
which could become &lt;section&gt; or whatever's appropriate in HTML 5)?

&gt;<i> Since the &lt;header&gt; can contain multiple distinct logical sections of
</I>&gt;<i> the document, each with their own headers, it makes no sense to
</I>&gt;<i> implicitly wrap its contents in &lt;hgroup&gt;.
</I>
You're right.  What I was really thinking of is something closer to:
inside &lt;header&gt; if any &lt;hx&gt; elements are encountered before any nested
sectioning elements then treat all the &lt;hx&gt; elements as being a single
heading.

So &lt;header&gt; could still contain &lt;section&gt;-s, with their own headings.
And a &lt;header&gt; with no &lt;hx&gt; elements wouldn't create an empty entry in
the outline.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Given the newness and nuance of &lt;header&gt; and &lt;hgroup&gt; and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   distinction between them, it's likely that some authors will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   confuse them.  Given that &lt;hgroup&gt; doesn't appear to do anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   on the page (it's similar to invisible meta-data), it's likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   that some authors will omit it[*1] when it's needed to convey the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   semantics they intend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is possible. The thinking behind the change (or, at least,
</I>&gt;<i> part of my reason for proposing it) was that it is less harmful if
</I>&gt;<i> authors omit something where it would be useful than that they use it
</I>&gt;<i> incorrectly in such a way that tools which follow the spec would be
</I>&gt;<i> broken from the point of view of end users.
</I>
That's a good point.

&gt;<i> In particular the old formulation of &lt;header&gt; would have caused the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h2&gt; element to be omitted from the outline in cases like &lt;header&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h1&gt; My Blog&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Navigation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/header&gt; , which
</I>&gt;<i> would be confusing for users.
</I>
Indeed.  What I intended to raise for consideration (and hopefully now
have done) is that &lt;header&gt; would not merge the above, because &lt;nav&gt;
starts a new section inside &lt;header&gt;.  Consider a similar example:

  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My Blog&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ramblings of an internet nobody&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Navigation&lt;/h2&gt; ... &lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;

The spec currently has both the &lt;h2&gt;-s as subsections.  The alternative
I was thinking of would treat the &lt;h1&gt; and first &lt;h2&gt; as being a single
heading (of the entire document), but keep the second &lt;h2&gt; (as the
heading of the navigation).

&gt;<i> On he other hand in the current formulation of the spec, the most
</I>&gt;<i> likely error (omitting &lt;hgroup&gt; ) only has the effect that that
</I>&gt;<i> outline heirachy is slightly wrong, with the subheader appearing as an
</I>&gt;<i> actual header; it does not lead to data loss. This seems like a much
</I>&gt;<i> better failure mode.
</I>
That's true.  But if the number of failures can be minimized, it matters
less what the failure mode is.

My concern is that with &lt;hgroup&gt; being so esoteric, combined with its
effect being largely invisible, it will hardly be used and therefore
possibly not worth adding to HTML 5.

Authors don't have a good track record on accurately adding invisible
metadata.  If we can algorithmically get it right in most cases, while
leaving a way for careful authors to explicitly override it if
necessary, that may be better overall.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Are there significant cases where &lt;hgroup&gt; will be useful outside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   of &lt;header&gt; ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &lt;hgroup&gt; exists to allow for subtitles and the like.  It's fairly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  common for documents to have these -- where it's likely there's use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  for a &lt;header&gt; element anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  It's much less common for a mere section of a document to warrant a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  multi-part title; is that a case which is worth solving?  If it is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  would it be problematic to force authors to use &lt;header&gt; there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems highly odd to have &lt;header&gt; perform a dual role where
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes it means &quot;section header&quot; and sometimes it means &quot;group of
</I>&gt;<i> heading/subheading elements&quot;. Much more confusing than one element per
</I>&gt;<i> role.
</I>
I think the two concepts are sufficiently overlapping that it isn't
really a dual role.  &lt;header&gt; could mean 'section (or document) header'
-- it would be used when a section's header consists of more than just a
single &lt;hx&gt; element.  Whether those elements are because of multi-part
titles or search boxes or whatever is a distinction that authors would
not need to think about.

&gt;<i> Section headers with subtitles lower down in the document hierarchy
</I>&gt;<i> occur with a decent frequency in my pages.  The document itself would
</I>&gt;<i> have a complex &lt;header&gt; (possibly with an &lt;hgroup&gt; ), then the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; would have an &lt;hgroup&gt; of its own.
</I>
But if the first &lt;hgroup&gt; were omitted and the second &lt;hgroup&gt; were
written as &lt;header&gt;, and the document conveyed exactly the same
semantics, would that actually be worse?
