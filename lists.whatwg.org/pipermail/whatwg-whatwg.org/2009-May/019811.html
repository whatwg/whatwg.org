I thought everyone had seen the confusion. There are pointers at
<A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Namespace_confusion">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Namespace_confusion</A>
The wiki page is less than a decade old, so it's length isn't quite  
that impressive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have been a Java programmer for some years, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still find that convention absurd, horrible, and annoying. I'll  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> agree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that CURIEs are ugly, and maybe hard to understand, but reversed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> domains are equally ugly and hard to understand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problems shared by CURIEs, URIs and reverse DNS names:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * Long.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * Identifiers outlive organization charts.
</I>&gt;<i> Ehm. CURIEs ain't really long: the main point of prefixes is to make
</I>&gt;<i> them as short as reasonably possible.
</I>
You need to consider the length of the prefix declarations, too.

&gt;&gt;<i> Problems that reverse DNS names and URIs don't have but CURIEs have:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * Prefix-based indirection.
</I>&gt;<i> Indirection can't be taken as a problem when most currently used RDFa
</I>&gt;<i> tools don't use it at all (which proves that they can work without
</I>&gt;<i> relying on it).
</I>
What do you mean? Current RDFa tools don't use prefixes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I understand that if the microdata syntax offered no advantages  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RDFa,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then it would be a wasted effort to diverge.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Which are the advantages it offers?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The syntax is simpler for the use cases it was designed for. It  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uses a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simpler conceptual model (trees as opposed to graphs). It allows  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> short token
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identifiers. It doesn't use prefix-based indirection. It doesn't  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> violate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DOM Consistency Design Principle.
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, the syntax is simpler for a subset of the use cases; but it leaves
</I>&gt;<i> entirely out the rest of use cases.
</I>
What are the rest of the use cases? Why weren't they put forward when  
Hixie asked for use cases?

&gt;<i> The DOM Consistency again is not an advantage of the microdata syntax
</I>&gt;<i> because this could have been fulfilled with other syntaxes as well.
</I>
It's an advantage over RDFa-in-XHTML-served-as-text/html. It's not an  
advantage over microformats or may not be an advantage over a  
speculative yet undefined variation of RDFa.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that it avoids much of what microformats advocates  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> objectionable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Could you specify, please? Do you mean anything else than WHATWG's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> almost irrational hate toward CURIEs and everything that involves
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prefixes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RDFa uses a data model that is an overkill for the use cases.
</I>&gt;<i> Which use cases?
</I>
<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-April/019374.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-April/019374.html</A>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No, it *can't* represent a full RDF model: it has already been shown
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> several times on this thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's a feature.
</I>&gt;<i> What?? Being unable to deal with all the use cases is a feature??
</I>
Being simpler while addressing all the use cases is a feature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Wait. Are you refering to microdata as an incremental improvement  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RDFa?? IMO, it's rather a decremental enworsement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That depends on the point of view. I'm sensing two major points of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> view:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Graphs are more general than trees. Hence, being able to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serialize graphs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Graphs are more general than trees. Hence, graphs are harder to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UIs for, harder to traverse and harder for authors to grasp. Hence,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if trees
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are enough to address use cases, we should only enable trees to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serialized.
</I>&gt;<i> &#172;&#172; Again, what's your basis to decide that &quot;trees are enough to
</I>&gt;<i> address use cases&quot;?? Of course, they are enough to solve some use
</I>&gt;<i> cases, but the convenience of dealing with just trees is not worth
</I>&gt;<i> sacrificing the needs of those use cases you are arbirarily deciding
</I>&gt;<i> to ignore.
</I>
I don't see anything on <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-April/019374.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-April/019374.html</A> 
  that doesn't boil down to trees or simple key-value pairs attached  
to an item.

&gt;&gt;<i> I subscribe to view #2, and it seems that trees are indeed enough  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use cases (that were stipulated by the pro-graph people!).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Microdata can't represent the full RDF data model (while RDFa  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can):
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some complex structures are just not expressable with microdata.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's not a use case. That's &quot;theoretical purity&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not &quot;theoretical purity&quot;, it's something simpler:
</I>&gt;<i> *extensibility*. And, with over two decades between versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> specs, this is a strong requirement: if a problem is noticed after
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 becomes &quot;the standard&quot;, it's essential to be able to solve it
</I>&gt;<i> without waiting 10 or 20 years for HTML6 to come out.
</I>
Well, you have to commit to some bounds on extensibility. For example,  
the DOM is committed to being a tree.

&gt;<i> In addition,
</I>&gt;<i> your alleged &quot;simplified&quot; data model is actually an over-complication,
</I>&gt;<i> as it is defined in the form of restrictions and/or limitations over
</I>&gt;<i> RDF's model. Try to explain what can be represented in RDF, and what
</I>&gt;<i> can be represented with microdata, and you'll see what's simpler.
</I>
Microdata isn't defined in terms of RDF's model. It has its own model  
which is mappable to RDF (even though you cannot map RDF to microdata  
in the general case).
