</I>
by an &quot;adapted container&quot; do you mean something like Ogg Skeleton, ie.
a video container that records the desired in/out points?

I agree with David's suggestion, as I understand it in the context of
HTML5: the UA may present the context of media segments that use '#'
and '?' syntax differently.

However I don't think this should change how we do data transport (ie.
the HTTP and the media container). I'd suggest that the scope that
should be covered in HTML5 is to suggest how much seek bar should be
displayed for the video. However when the user navigates on that seek
bar (by clicking on a random position), the UA may use whatever means
are appropriate for the media type [as suggested by the media
fragments wg] in order to retrieve that data.

Conrad.
