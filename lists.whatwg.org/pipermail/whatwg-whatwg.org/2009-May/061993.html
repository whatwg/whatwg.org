Sorry, I meant mobile browsers *with* audio but *without* significant
config dialogs.

</I>
Part of your argument against just making this a SHOULD was about
people not having the knowledge or ability to switch browsers, in the
event that their current browser doesn't provide them a way to
globally mute &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt;.  My point was that the vast majority of
such people are on one of the versions of Internet Explorer, as that
is the basic 'default' on Windows.  Given that IE, even up through
IE8, doesn't support  &lt;audio&gt;/&lt;video&gt; at all, let alone with special
consideration for accessibility, those people without the
knowledge/ability to switch browsers are pretty much stuck anyway, no
matter what the spec says.

Thus, it should be acceptable to push browser vendors to provide this
feature simple for accessibility purposes, and those users who *can*
switch their browsers will be able to switch to one that implements
this.
