Physical media do tend to converge due to network effects. I think the  
effect is less strong for digital file formats. For example, MP3 and  
AAC are both fairly successful; similarly, MPEG-4, Windows Media and  
Ogg are all getting some degree of traction. But you may be right that  
ultimately there will be only one winner.

</I>
 From my cursory study, I think microdata could subsume many of the  
use cases of both microformats and RDFa. It seems to me that it avoids  
much of what microformats advocates find objectionable, and provides a  
good basis for new microformats; but at the same time it seems it can  
represent a full RDF data model. Thus, I think we have the potential  
to get one solution that works for everyone.

I'm not 100% sure microdata can really achieve this, but I think  
making the attempt is a positive step.

One other detail that it seems not many people have picked up on yet  
is that microdata proposes a DOM API to extract microdata-based info  
from a live document on the client side. In my opinion this is huge  
and has the potential to greatly increase author interest in semantic  
markup.

Now, it may be that microdata will ultimately fail, either because it  
is outcompeted by RDFa, or because not enough people care about  
semantic markup, or whatever. But at least for now, I don't see a  
reason to strangle it in the cradle.

Regards,
Maciej
