That explains _how_ they are different (as does the spec), but not _why_
it is like that.

More specifically:

* Are there significant cases where &lt;header&gt; needs _not_ to imply
  &lt;hgroup&gt;?  Consider wrapping an &lt;hgroup&gt; inside every &lt;header&gt;; how
  many places has that broken the semantics?  I could believe that most
  of the cases where a pager header appropriately contains multiple
  headings they are subtitles rather than subsections.

  Anybody who specifically needs subsections in a &lt;header&gt; could still
  have them by using &lt;section&gt; inside &lt;header&gt;.  That wouldn't help for
  the 'Little Green Guys with Guns' example (where a section is started
  in a &lt;header&gt; then 'leaks out' into the following elements) -- but
  would it be unacceptable to force authors to write that with &lt;/header&gt;
  before one of the &lt;h2&gt;-s?

* Given the newness and nuance of &lt;header&gt; and &lt;hgroup&gt; and the
  distinction between them, it's likely that some authors will confuse
  them.  Given that &lt;hgroup&gt; doesn't appear to do anything on the page
  (it's similar to invisible meta-data), it's likely that some authors
  will omit it[*1] when it's needed to convey the semantics they intend.

  Might actually the number of authors who mistakenly write &lt;header&gt;
  instead of &lt;header&gt;&lt;hgroup&gt; outnumber those who need to have
  subsections in headers?  That is, if &lt;header&gt; implied &lt;hgroup&gt;, might
  it fix more cases than it breaks?

* Are there significant cases where &lt;hgroup&gt; will be useful outside of
  &lt;header&gt;?

  &lt;hgroup&gt; exists to allow for subtitles and the like.  It's fairly
  common for documents to have these -- where it's likely there's use
  for a &lt;header&gt; element anyway.
  
  It's much less common for a mere section of a document to warrant a
  multi-part title; is that a case which is worth solving?  If it is,
  would it be problematic to force authors to use &lt;header&gt; there?

  I think that would mean that a subsection like this:

    &lt;hgroup&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kaboom!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A Mysterious Loud Noise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/hgroup&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly ...

  Would instead have to be written as:

    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;header&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kaboom!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;A Mysterious Loud Noise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Suddenly ...
    &lt;/section&gt;

  That doesn't seem too onerous for such a niche usage.

If &lt;header&gt; implied &lt;hgroup&gt; semantics (but only acted as a heading if
there actually is an &lt;h1&gt; somewhere inside it) and if all current uses
of &lt;hgroup&gt; could be put inside a &lt;header&gt; then we could avoid
introducing the &lt;hgroup&gt; element.

Smylers

[*1]  &lt;header&gt; is less likely to suffer from this since it's often
replacing &lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt; or similar; authors want a block at that
point in the page anyway.
