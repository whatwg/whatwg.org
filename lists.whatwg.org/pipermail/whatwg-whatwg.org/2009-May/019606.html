The person writing the vocabulary, presumably.

I don't think that would really scale. Even for major languages, like 
HTML, we haven't found a single organisation to be a successful model.


Manu's list didn't mention anything about a single organisation:

Surely all of the above apply equally to any RDFa vocabulary just as it 
would to _any_ vocabularly, regardless of the underlying syntax?

Consider each of these in turn:

1: You have to make sure you're not reinventing the wheel, whatever 
language or vocabulary you are designing.

2: You have to make sure whatever language or vocabulary you are designing 
is something that your users can use.

3: If you do have to invent a new language or vocabulary, it makes sense 
to base it on the base of knowledge humanity has collected on the subject.

4: You have to study the information collected in steps 2 and 3 to make 
sense of it.

5: Deriving vocabulary names is a key part of any language design effort.

6: Justifying your design is a key part of any language design effort 
also. Not doing this would lead to a language or vocabulary with 
unnecessary parts, making it harder to use.

7: With any language, part of designing the vocabulary is defining how to 
process content that uses it.

8: Defining any language or vocabulary effectively must, clearly, involve 
a feedback loop with community review.

9: The most important practical test of a language is the test of 
deployment. Getting feedback and writing code is naturally part of writing 
a format.

10: You have to specify the language.

As far as I can tell, the steps above are just the steps one would take 
for designing any format, language, or vocabulary. Are you saying that 
creating an RDF vocabulary _doesn't_ involve these steps? How is an RDF 
vocabulary defined if not using these steps?
