Thank you for a very informative reply.  Inline comments follow.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am somewhat surprised that you are unaware of this
</I>&gt;<i> issue,
</I>&gt;<i> considering that you mentioned it specifically by name
</I>&gt;<i> (submarine
</I>&gt;<i> patent).
</I>
Yes, I agree and I was not making this clear in my reply posts.  The first email I sent I did detail this.  

&gt;<i> I'm more familiar with the area of audio coding than video,
</I>&gt;<i> so I don't
</I>&gt;<i> have a ready list of patents that read on mpeg1 video.
</I>&gt;<i> However, There
</I>&gt;<i> are mid-90s patents which read on both layer-2 (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 5,214,678) and
</I>&gt;<i> layer-3 audio which followed the 'submarine patent' style
</I>&gt;<i> of prolonged
</I>&gt;<i> application and late disclosure times.
</I>
That is interesting that 5,214,678 is considered to read on Layer-2 since
AudioMPEG says that they are not doing licensing for Video-CD, which uses
MPEG-1 Layer 2 audio.  It was granted in May 25, 1993 and filed on May 31, 
1990, so it barely made it in three years (and will not expire till 
May 31, 2010).

&gt;<i> Additionally, Theora avoids some techniques used in MPEG1
</I>&gt;<i> which have
</I>&gt;<i> been believed to be patented.&#160; For example, the
</I>&gt;<i> differential coding of
</I>&gt;<i> motion vectors. While I don't have the knowledge needed to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a
</I>&gt;<i> detailed analysis, even I know enough to point out at least
</I>&gt;<i> a few
</I>&gt;<i> engineering reasons why Theora has less patent exposure
</I>&gt;<i> surface than
</I>&gt;<i> MPEG1.
</I>
I can certainly believe that MPEG-1 Video might be non-royalty free and 
Theora might be.  I haven't really looked at the exact coding of Theora motion vectors.  That is an interesting thing to look at. 

&gt;<i> Without the benefit of mpeg layer-3 audio MPEG1 is left
</I>&gt;<i> enormously
</I>&gt;<i> handicapped compared to Theora+Vorbis. 16kHz 16bit stereo
</I>&gt;<i> PCM is
</I>&gt;<i> 512kbit/sec on it own, which is comparable to the total
</I>&gt;<i> bitrate 'high
</I>&gt;<i> quality' option delivered by sites like Youtube. And 16kHz
</I>&gt;<i> audio is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty poor for anything that needs to carry music.&#160;
</I>
Layer-2 audio can certainly beat PCM for compression, since it can reduce
the bit rate for coding the quieter frequency bands.  Typical stereo bit 
rates for stereo Layer 2 audio are probably more on the order of 256 
kbit/s.  Vorbis and MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 certainly can beat this rate.    

&gt;<i> While you could
</I>&gt;<i> argue for using MPEG1+Vorbis, none of the few parties who
</I>&gt;<i> indicated
</I>&gt;<i> that they would not ship Theora have stated they would (or
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> already) shipping Vorbis. (For example, Nokia does not ship
</I>&gt;<i> Vorbis on
</I>&gt;<i> their Linux tables)&#160; Everyone shipping Vorbis already
</I>&gt;<i> seems to have no
</I>&gt;<i> issue with Theora.
</I>
I am not going to argue for MPEG-1 video plus Vorbis audio.  

&gt;<i> Even if you pay fairly low prices for transit the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> sending PCM
</I>&gt;<i> audio vs Vorbis is likely enough to pay for the H.264+AAC
</I>&gt;<i> licensing no
</I>&gt;<i> matter what it turns out to be in 2010.&#160; A 'free'
</I>&gt;<i> format which has an
</I>&gt;<i> effective price much higher than the 'non-free' stuff would
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> something of a hollow victory.
</I>
Interesting point.  I think that transit costs will decrease 
faster than H.264+AAC licensing costs, (unless Theora and Vorbis 
start causing serious competion.)

&gt;<i> And really, now that we see multiple large companies with
</I>&gt;<i> experienced
</I>&gt;<i> legal teams and non-trivial exposure committed to shipping
</I>&gt;<i> Theora I
</I>&gt;<i> think we're kidding ourselves when we attempt to analyze
</I>&gt;<i> this as a
</I>&gt;<i> legal issue. It's not. It's a business/political decision.
</I>&gt;<i> The market
</I>&gt;<i> is now going to battle it out.&#160; Enjoy the show.
</I>
I agree.  I was not aware that Google planned on shipping Theora support when I made the first email last week (Wikipedia article since updated). 
If Ogg Theora and Vorbis become the defacto standard, that is 
fine with me.  

Right now, the best video codec/audio codec that works with Gstreamer good 
plugins (i.e. Linux), Quicktime and Media Player is Motion JPEG with PCM 
audio, which I have used for shipping videos on CDs and USB drives, but is 
impractical for online transfers.  I am hoping for a better outcome with 
the video tag.
