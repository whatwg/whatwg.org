Sounds like &quot;urn:&quot; to me. Registry is defined in RFC 3406.

Too fragile for disambiguation for my taste.

URI give you the choice of having something easily referenceable (if you 
want), or not.

No, I don't think we have evidence that prefix-based indirection is too 
hard. There are way to many people getting it right.

</I>
Introducing @prefix will be much simpler to deploy than introducing a 
completely different system.

That being said, I do agree that the current situation is a mess, and 
that the RDFa-in-XHTML spec has created it.

Given the current situation, the simplest possible solution probably is 
to live with it, and use xmlns declarations in HTML for the purpose of 
RDFa as well.
