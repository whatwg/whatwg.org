</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;        The video is then available inline in his blog, along

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why does the license information need to be machine-readable in this

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dealt with separately.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would need to be machine-readable for tools like
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://search.creativecommons.org/">http://search.creativecommons.org/</A> to do their job: check the license
</I>&gt;<i> against the engine's built-in knowledge of some licenses, and figure
</I>&gt;<i> out if it is suitable for the usages the user has requested (like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;search for content I can build upon&quot; or &quot;search for content I can use
</I>&gt;<i> commercialy&quot;). Ideally, a search engine should have enough with
</I>&gt;<i> finding the video on either Tara's site *or* Paul's blog for it to be
</I>&gt;<i> available for users.
</I>
Yeah, that sounds plausible.  However that's what I meant by &quot;a
different scenario&quot; -- adding criteria to the above, specifically about
searching.  Hixie attempted to address this case too:

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Admittedly, if this scenario is taken in the context of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; first scenario, meaning that Bob wants this image to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; discoverable through search, but doesn't want to include it on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; page of its own, then extra syntax to mark this particular image
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; up would be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; However, in my research I found very few such cases. In every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; case where I found multiple media items on a single page with no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; dedicated page, either every item was licensed identically and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; was the main content of the page, or each item had its own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; separate page, or the items were licensed under the same license
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; as the page. In all three of these cases, rel=license already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; solves the problem today.
</I>
To which Nils responded:

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Relying on linked pages just to get licensing information would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be, well, massive overhead. Still, you are right - most blogs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; using many pictures have dedicated pages.
</I>
It's perfectly valid to disagree with this being sufficient (I
personally have no view either way on the matter).  I was just
clarifying that the legend mark-up example wasn't attempting to address
this case, and wasn't proposing &lt;legend&gt;&lt;small&gt; (or whatever) as a
machine-readable microformat.
