could you elaborate?

</I>
Roughly, yes.  I am saying that

? -- the author of the URI has to know that the 
server he points the URI at supports the ? 
syntax.  The server essentially makes a resource 
using the query instructions, and delivers it to 
the UA.

# -- the UA focuses the user's attention on, and 
optimizes the network usage for that focus of, 
the indicated fragment.  It does this (a) 
visually, using whatever indicator it likes (we 
don't specify what the 'controller' looks like) 
and (b) using whatever network support it can get 
from the server (time-range, byte-range, or no 
support at all).

A reason I say this is that technically I believe 
that # is stripped by the UA;  we cannot then put 
a delivery requirement in, because that would 
apply to the server, which doesn't even get to 
see the # in all likelihood.
