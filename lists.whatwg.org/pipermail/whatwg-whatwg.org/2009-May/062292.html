Pointer, please.

That's fine; I have no problem with that.

Precisely my point above.

&gt;<i> eg. why should drawing an arc in a canvas produce aliased output yet 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing an arc in svg not when they're both being drawn at the same time 
</I>&gt;<i> on the same device?
</I>
It shouldn't, if you're drawing the arc via the vector canvas API... 
except for the little issue that canvas is fundamentally a bitmap and 
you get to set up how big the bitmap is (via its width and height 
properties).  That's more or less by design: canvas is meant to be an 
editable bitmap image.  We can argue about whether such a thing is 
desirable, of course.

&gt;<i> or why should text drawn to the canvas look fuzzy 
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the text drawn next to it outside of the canvas?  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> basically what you are asking for.
</I>
Not at all.  What I am asking for is that if you getImageData you get 
CSS pixels, so that you don't end up with device-dependent behavior of 
getImageData.  Similarly, I'm asking that the pixels in putImageData be 
treated as CSS pixels, so that you don't have to write device-dependent 
code for filling in the imageData before putting it. This has no effect 
on text drawing or arc drawing; those would happen at whatever 
resolution the UA decides to use for the canvas' backing store (which 
may well be significantly higher than the resolution of the device the 
canvas is going to be painted to, precisely because the UA wants things 
to remain non-fuzzy even if the canvas is scaled).

Let's take a concrete example.  I'd like to use canvas to draw Julia 
sets.  I specify a 500x500 size for the canvas (via width and height) 
and plan to use it to represent a rectangle in the complex plane that 
satisfies |Re(z)| &lt; 250 and |Im(z)| &lt; 250.  This 500x500 size is in CSS 
pixels.  The UA allocates some sort of backing store for it (maybe it's 
500x500, maybe it's 2000x2000; that's the UA's business and might depend 
on the device).  So far everything is the same both in the spec as it 
stands now and in what I think it should say.

Now I start actually computing my pixel color values.  I iterate over my 
values of Z, compute the color for each value... then what do I put in 
the imageData?  With the spec as written it depends on the precise 
backing store setup, because I am trying to actually color in the 
logical pixels of the canvas.  If imageData used CSS pixels, I just put 
each of my computed color values into one pixel of the imageData.  That 
might be more than one pixel in the UA's backing store, but that's not a 
problem: I'm doing raw bitmap access, and hence would expect the bitmap 
to alias if zoomed in.

P.S.  Either I totally misunderstood your reply, or you totally 
misunderstood my original proposal.  I'd like to know which.

P.P.S.  If the point is that one might want to draw some arcs+text, then 
getImageData to get the backing store, then do some sort of processing 
on it, then put it back and not lose quality, then it sounds like we 
need two different image data APIs: one that works on backing store 
pixels for such processing, and one that works on CSS pixels for 
actually painting to the canvas.

P.P.P.S.  Yes, I know it's possible to use fillRect() to get the effect 
I want for Julia sets.  It's a lot slower (2-40x, depending on how hard 
you try to work around the slowness and which browser you're using and 
exactly what your pixels look like) than using imageData.
