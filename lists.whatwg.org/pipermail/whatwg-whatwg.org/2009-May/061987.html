If I remember correctly, Henri had an issue with the DOM when it came to 
support of namespaces in XHTML, and not in HTML, which was the reason 
that @prefix or something along those lines proposed. There was quite 
positive progress in this regard, too. I don't know what happened to 
that progress.

But regardless, the majority of people will include metadata markup by 
installing a plug-in or module, and making a couple of choices. And if 
you put together a good ten-minute tutorial for the average developer, 
they'll have no problem with &quot;foaf:name&quot;. Training and clarity of 
communication is much ore important than form, it always has been with 
technology.

The examples you come up with just don't justify discarding 
consideration of a capability that just started getting incorporated 
into Google search. I would say if your fellow Google developers could 
understand how this all works, there is hope for others.
