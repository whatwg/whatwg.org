</I>Because one would assume that one way to accomplish a task would be more 
attractive to web developers, designers, parser developers, browsers, et 
al.

In addition, one would also assume that one way to accomplish a task 
would be more attractive in regards to testing, maintaining and moving 
on in the future.

Notice how there is only VHS and not Betamax?

Notice the same about Blu-Ray and HD-TV? People won't buy into something 
while there are competitive specs, and these are &quot;competitive&quot; in that 
it makes little since to use both in a document, though you can now.

The point is, people in the real world have to use this stuff. It helps 
them if they have one, generally agreed on approach. As it is, folks 
have to contend with both RDFa and microformats, but at least we know 
these have different purposes.
