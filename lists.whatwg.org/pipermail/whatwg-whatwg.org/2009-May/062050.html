</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hear hear.  Lets call it &quot;Cascading RDF Sheets&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/spec">http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/spec</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/reactions">http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/reactions</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RDFa is better though.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What does 'better' mean in this context? Why and how? Because it is easier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to process? But EASE seems more compatible with microformats, and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;better&quot; in that sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd also like clarification here.  I dislike *all* of the inline
</I>&gt;<i> metadata proposals to some degree, for the same reasons that I dislike
</I>&gt;<i> inline @style and @onfoo handlers.  A Selector-based way of applying
</I>&gt;<i> semantics fits my theoretical needs much better.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
A possibly 10 year old use case where I think EASE  - or GRDDL as such - 
should fit in:

Shelley and Geoffrey reminded us that &quot;RSS 1.0&quot; stands for &quot;RDF Site 
Summary 1.0&quot;.  The W3 also uses RSS 1.0. for its feed[1].  The feed is 
generated via a profile transformation [2] that happens with XSLT. The 
profile defines the &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt; as news items (note the 
combination of element and class - as in EASE)-  But the profile also 
implements particular rules for particular elements without looking at 
the @class. (E.g. each &lt;div class=&quot;item&quot;&gt; must contain &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt;, for 
example.)

All in all, it sounds very similar to what the newer technology GRDDL 
does, since it is all happening based on a profile and some class names 
and specific element structures. And, this is possible to test with the 
W3 GRDDL service, which produces a &quot;feed&quot; that in fact, when you look 
with the right eyes, is the same as the published homepage feed[3].

If the &quot;microdata&quot; becomes part of the final version of HTML 5, then 
GRDDL  (with or without EASE) will probably prosper, since it probably 
doesn't matter to GRDDL whether it looks into @class or @item, as long 
as &quot;the thing&quot; is part of the profile and the profiletransformation. 
(But it would be interesting if someone in the know could test if the 
&quot;triples&quot; would be the same, etc ...) And if so, then the introduction 
of &quot;microdata&quot; increases the need for @profile in HTML 5.

&gt;&gt;<i> I read all the reactions you pointed to. Some made the claim that EASE would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> move semantics out of the HTML file, and that microformats was better as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keeps the semantics inside the file. But I of course agree with you that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EASE just underline/outline the semantics already in the file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup.  The appropriate critique of separated metadata is that the
</I>&gt;<i> *data* is moved out of the document, where it will inevitably decay
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the live document.  RDF-EASE keeps all the data stored in
</I>&gt;<i> the live document, and merely specifies how to extract it.  The only
</I>&gt;<i> way you can lose data then is by changing the html structure itself,
</I>&gt;<i> which is much less common than just changing the content.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
That the structure changes seldom, /could/ be a reason for using RDFa to 
store the meta info in the very element instead of using EASE (or even 
Dublin Core in &lt;meta&gt; elements in the &lt;head&gt;). OTOH, that the structure 
changes little, could also be something that /permits/ the use of GRDDL 
... So it depends on how you see it.

&gt;&gt;<i> From the EASE draft:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> All properties in RDF-EASE begin with the string -rdf-, as per &#167;4.1.2.1
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Vendor-specific extensions in [CSS21]. This allows RDF-EASE and CSS to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> safely mixed in one file, [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder why you think it is so important to be able to mix CSS and EASE. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems better to separate the two completely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not thrilled with the mixture of CSS and metadata either.  Just
</I>&gt;<i> because it uses Selectors doesn't mean it needs to be specifiable
</I>&gt;<i> alongside CSS.  jQuery uses Selectors too, but it stays where it
</I>&gt;<i> belongs.  ^_^  (That being said, there's a plugin for it that allows
</I>&gt;<i> you to specify js in your CSS, and it gets applied to the matching
</I>&gt;<i> elements from the block's selector.)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
But may be, after all, it ain't so bad. It is good to have the 
opportunity. :-) (Since you, as I perceived it, disagreed with yourself 
above, I continue the tradition.) :-)
