</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a sad fact that the same mistakes are repeated over and over again

</I>&gt;<i> Don't go with an ancient model whose shortcomings are well known but use

I agree that BibTeX is suboptimal. But what should we use instead?

(The biblatex vocabulary seems unnecessarily incompatible with BibTeX's, 
and the latter appears to have more deployed support, which was one of the 
primary concerns that led to its vocabulary being picked.)
