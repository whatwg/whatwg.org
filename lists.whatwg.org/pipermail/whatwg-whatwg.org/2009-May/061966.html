</I>
Sure.  I think we are probably in agreement.  Logically, the UA is 
dealing with the whole resource -- which is why it's 5s in this case. 
The UA is also responsible for focusing the user on the fragment, and 
(implicitly) for optimizing the network for what the user is focusing 
on.

For example, some UAs would essentially invoke the same code if the 
user immediately did a seek to a time, if the javacsript did a seek 
to a time, or the initial URI had a fragment indicator starting at a 
time.  In all three cases, the UA tries to start at that time as best 
it can, optimizing network access to do that.

&gt;<i>  &gt; But we can optimize for the fragment without disallowing the seeking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What do you mean by &quot;optimize for the fragment&quot;?
</I>
I mean, the UA can get support from the server for time-based access, 
helping optimizing the network access for the fragment to be 
presented, while at the same time allowing seeking outside that 
fragment.

&gt;<i>  Of course none of the
</I>&gt;<i>discussion will inherently disallow seeking - scripts will always be
</I>&gt;<i>able to do the seeking. But the user may not find it easy to do
</I>&gt;<i>seeking to a section that is not accessible through the displayed
</I>&gt;<i>timeline, which can be both a good and a bad thing.
</I>
How easy a particular user interface is to use for various tasks is 
(I hope) not our worry...
