It only needs to keep it as long as Back history is kept, and could get  
rid of it as soon as this entry is removed from Back/Forward history.

&gt;&gt;<i> * If it's not safe to resubmit, use status 303. I know it's not very

</I>
You store the data on server side, and redirect to URL that contains  
unique ID for this data.

It's just a few lines in PHP (and similar solutions shuold be possible in all web frameworks):

$id = uniqid();
$_SESSION[$id] = $_POST;
header(&quot;Location: [&#8230;]/result.php?id=$id&quot;,false,303);

and later:

$_POST = $_SESSION[$_GET['id']];

This works even for multiple submissions done in parallel and it's pretty  
secure and tamper-proof.

&gt;&gt;<i> * If it's safe to resubmit, use PUT method (allowed in HTML 5), which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is idempotent by definition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theoretically, but not really in practice.  Someone else might have
</I>&gt;<i> PUT something new at the URL since your last PUT, or DELETEd it, or
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise done something to it.  In that case, you'd overwrite their
</I>&gt;<i> modifications.  PUT is only practically idempotent if only one user is
</I>&gt;<i> modifying the resource, as far as I can tell.
</I>
That's a good point.

Is it possible for HTML 5 spec to say that browsers may re-send PUT without asking? (and that authors should use PUT only when resending is not going to cause this problems).
