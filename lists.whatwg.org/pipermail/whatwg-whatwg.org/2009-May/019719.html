<PRE>Tab Atkins Jr. on Tue, 12 May 2009 12:30:27 -0500:

&gt;<i> On Tue, May 12, 2009 at 5:55 AM, Eduard Pascual:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; [...] It would be preferable to be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to state something like &quot;each (row) &lt;tr&gt; in the &lt;table&gt; describes an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; iguana: the &lt;img&gt;s are each iguana's picture, the contents of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;a&gt;'s are the names, and the @href of the &lt;a&gt;'s are the URLs to their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; main pages&quot; just once.
</I>Indeed.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If I only need to state the table headings once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for the users to understand this concept, why should a micro-data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; consumer require me to state it 20 times, once for each row?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Please note how such a page would be quite painful to maintain: any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; mistake in the micro-data mark-up would generate invalid data and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; require a manual harvest of the data on the page, thus killing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; whole purpose of micro-data.
</I>
Indeed. (But of course, for &quot;copy-paste&quot; safety, the format has to be 
&quot;wordy&quot; and repetitive.)

&gt;&gt;<i>  And repeating something 20 (or more)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; times brings a lot of chances to put a typo in, or to miss an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; attribute, or any minor but devastating mistake like these.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, he didn't quite *ignore* it - he did explicitly call out that
</I>&gt;<i> requirement to say that his solution didn't solve it at all.  He also
</I>&gt;<i> laid down the reason why - it's unlikely that any reasonable simple
</I>&gt;<i> in-place metadata solution would allow you to do that.  You either
</I>&gt;<i> need significant complexity, some reliance on language semantics (like
</I>&gt;<i> tables can rely on their headers), or moving to out-of-band
</I>&gt;<i> specification, likely through a Selectors-based model.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Indeed. And Ian's arguments against a selector based model (the claim 
that authors have problems understanding selectors) was one of the least 
convincing arguments he made, I think.  CSS and selectors appears to be 
one of the best understood technologies of the web.
&gt;<i> The last is likely the best solution for that, and is even easier to
</I>&gt;<i> implement within Ian' simplified proposal.  I don't see a good reason
</I>&gt;<i> why that can't advance on a separate track, as (being out-of-band) it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't require changes to HTML to be usable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I floated a basic proposal for Cascading RDF[1] several months ago,
</I>&gt;<i> and someone else (I think Eduard?  I'd have to check my archives) did
</I>&gt;<i> something very similar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1]: <A HREF="http://www.xanthir.com/rdfa-vs-crdf.php">http://www.xanthir.com/rdfa-vs-crdf.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Hear hear.  Lets call it &quot;Cascading RDF Sheets&quot;. It could be used for 
the following purposes:

1. The IRI of the Cascading RDF Sheet could serve the role of profile URI;
2. The Cascading RDF Sheet itself could serve the role of a profile 
document; (Finally we could get some kind of registered profile format.)
3. Just as CSS sheets today, a cRDFsheet could be used as authoring 
help, when authoring with a microformat. HTML editing programs could 
offer the elements + classes in the Cascading RDF Sheet to authors, the 
same way that some editors to today use the selectors in stylesheets as 
a &quot;vocabulary repository&quot; for the current file or project. CSS selectors 
is already a well known format. (One may then, of course, already use a 
CSS style sheet for this, kind of. But this soon becomes clumsy. Better 
to separate styling from semantics and structure.)

In fact, I myself begun looking into creating something along these 
lines ... Though rather than a &quot;Cascading RDF Sheet&quot;, I looked into 
creating a &quot;Profile Style Sheet&quot; which could be used to define a machine 
readable microformat profile. My motivation for doing this was the 
authoring side of things, as I have been using a text editor which more 
or less uses CSS selectors the same way. (Instead of only offering me to 
pick &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot; it also offers me to to pick &lt;p class=&quot;a&quot;&gt; etc.) Ian's 
proposal do not give much thought about the authoring side, I feel, 
except  for the more casual author. For authors, it is helpful to have a 
&quot;recipe&quot; document and to avoid repetition and &quot;data rot&quot;, as you 
mentioned in another message.

Ian's microdata format is easy to grasp the inner logics of - that is a 
good side of the proposal, this could help that it gets used.  But when 
it comes to author's and author groups' ability to define their own, 
decentralised semantics etc., then a decent profile format, which could 
be easily and simply integrated with authoring tools,  seems like a just 
as important  issue as a super simple microdata format.

The microformats.org community does not really have a machine parsable 
profile format. If there were such a format, I believe we would see more 
of more decentralized microformats.
