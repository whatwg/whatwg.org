Ah, thanks Eduard.  Have you cleaned this up significantly since the
last time this discussion came up?  It seems to read much better now
than before, but it's possible that I was just stupider several months
ago.

As far as I can tell (I am a novice, so YMMV), it conveys everything
that RDFa does, and more specifically, matches RDF-EASE's features.  I
think it has a friendly syntax than RDF-EASE, though, which I think is
tied too much to the exact structure of RDFa.  The author does
acknowledge that he leans directly on RDFa, but I think that's a
mistake - RDFa is designed to deal with the limitations of the
attr/value pairs that you can place on elements.  When you're
designing a new language by itself, you can employ the magic of
syntactic sugar to tighten things up and make them easier and more
expressive.

Frex, RDF-EASE uses -rdf-property to specify what property something
should be, and -rdf-content to specify whether a property should take
its value from the element's content or from an attribute.  This split
is necessary when embedding attributes in HTML, but your proposal
combines those two things into a single line, which I think is much
clearer, and makes it easier to use when specifying multiple
properties.  (Not to mention making inline specification even easier
than RDFa, as you point out.)

I recommend using 'self' as the value for @|subject that corresponds
to a blank node for each matched element.

How would you write the situation where you have two vocabs applying
to content in an intertwined way, with different subjects?  I can't
think of an explicit example right now, but say you had content like
&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;&lt;baz/&gt;&lt;/bar&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;, where &lt;foo&gt; and &lt;bar&gt; are both subjects
using different vocabs, and &lt;baz&gt; has facts about both of them.  It
seems like you can handle this by specifying two separate blocks with
an identical selector but different @|subject rules.  Is this correct?

If so, it seems then that at least one of those @|subject rules would
require either a url(...) or blank(...) value, which limits ones
ability to use this technique on multiple elements on a page.
RDF-EASE uses the nearest-ancestor(selector) functional notation to
indicate these sorts of relationships.

(Ah, here we go, an example:
<A HREF="http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/spec#ssec-properties--rdf-about">http://buzzword.org.uk/2008/rdf-ease/spec#ssec-properties--rdf-about</A>
talks about mixing foaf and vcard together, with one scenario matching
what I outlined earlier.)


Your proposal doesn't seem to have a way to specify the datatype
currently.  Since several people have brought up the lack of datatype
as a weakness in Ian's microdata proposal, this may be a weakness.


RDF-EASE allows you to 'reset' elements, *overriding* metadata given
by less-specific selectors rather than just augmenting it.  This does
seem like a nice ability, specifically when you need to provide a
general rule for a particular class, say, and give a slightly
different rule for one of those elements with a particular id.  On the
other hand, you can just write the general rule with :not() to avoid
the more specific element.  I'm not sure whether this is good enough,
or if it really is easier to use something like 'reset'.
