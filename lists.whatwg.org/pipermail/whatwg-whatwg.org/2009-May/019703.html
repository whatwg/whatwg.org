<PRE>A cursory glance on the new section 5 raises two questions on  
indirection:

&gt;<i> (Note the &lt;meta&gt;s in the last example -- since sometimes the  
</I>&gt;<i> information
</I>&gt;<i> isn't visible, rather than requiring that people put it in and hide it
</I>&gt;<i> with display:none, which has a rather poor accessibility story, I  
</I>&gt;<i> figured
</I>&gt;<i> we could just allow &lt;meta&gt; anywhere, if it has a property=&quot;&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> attribute.)
</I>
That seems to be a solution optimised for extremely invisible metadata  
but not for metadata which differs from the human visible data.  
Imagine as an example the simple act of marking up a number (and  
ignoring what the number denotes).  For human consumption a thousands  
seperator is often used, the type of seperator differs by language,  
locale and context. Just in my little word I see on regular basis the  
point, the comma, the space, the thin space and sometimes the the  
apostrophe. Parsing different representations of numbers would be a  
chore. The value of textContent of the element &lt;span  
itemprop=&quot;com.example.price&quot;&gt;&#8364;&amp;nbsp;1thinsp;000thinsp;000,&amp;mdash;&lt;/ 
span&gt; is clearly unusable, demanding an additional invisible &lt;meta  
property=&quot;com.example.price&quot; content=&quot;1000000&quot;&gt;.

My irritation lies in the element proliferation, requiring one element/ 
attribute combination for machines, one element/text content  
combination for humans. Of course, any sane author would arrange both  
elements in a close relation, as parent/child or sibling but there  
would be still two different elements to maintain, leading to a higher  
cognitive load. Not just for authors but also for programmers: a  
fluctating price had to be actualized on two different elements; tree  
walking DOM scripts had to take meta-Elements in account. Furthermore  
it clashes with the familiar habit of other elements in HTML. A  
hyperlink is one element with a machine-readable attribute and human- 
readable text content. A citation is one element with a machine- 
readable reference and human-readable text content. The same model is  
used in &lt;meter&gt;, &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;time&gt;, &lt;abbr&gt; ... but not in user- 
defined objects. I'd prefer an additional @content-like attribute  
which supersedes the text content and maybe even the default values of  
the other value-bearing elements, reducing two different elements to  
maintain or change to just one.


&gt;<i> Instead, let us try using the regular &quot;IDREF&quot; functionality that  
</I>&gt;<i> HTML uses
</I>&gt;<i> in a variety of other places, like &lt;label for=&quot;&quot;&gt;. For this we'll  
</I>&gt;<i> need a
</I>&gt;<i> new attribute, but unfortunately we can't use about=&quot;&quot; (which would  
</I>&gt;<i> be the
</I>&gt;<i> obvious name to use), because that would conflict with RDFa, so  
</I>&gt;<i> instead
</I>&gt;<i> we'll use subject=&quot;&quot;:
</I>

I'm slighty irritated by the implied change from active, possessive  
formulating (&#8220;The cat has the name Hedral.&#8221;) to something more passive- 
y (&#8220;Hedral is a name owned by that cat.&#8220;). My mental model for  
property relationships orients itself more on the former wording; link  
relationships are similar in that regard. @about/@subject are like  
@rev; a @resource alias @rel would feel more natural. There are  
practical relation by the missing @resource, I think. Imagine a  
document documenting an household and a household vocabulary which  
allows triples of &lt;human&gt;s which are in an &lt;owner&gt; relationship to a  
&lt;cat&gt;. Given an household of two humans and one cat; how does one  
markup the assumption that the cat has two owners?
