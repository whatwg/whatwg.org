<PRE>I would like to restore the pros and cons. Although they are not as 
consise as you would like there was still a considerable amount of time 
put into them and they do reflect the arguments put forward on both 
sides of the RDF discussions. You are asking for more detail and then 
removing the details that existed.

I understand your desire for more detail but please understand that in 
many cases the why is really self-explanatory. We are web professionals 
and academics, not children. In some, probably most, cases the Pros and 
Cons answer the why question in their own right.

I don't mind fleshing out the details and arguments behind more complex 
subjects but if you're going to block-delete contributions I don't see 
why I should bother. What really upset me is that you yourself set the 
precedent for simple Pro/Con bullet points under each &quot;requirement&quot; with 
your initial template. You can call it placeholder text if you like but 
I certainly got the impression that you were looking for concise points, 
not essays.

I don't want to undo, since you've added other clarifications since but 
I would like reassurance that if I copy-paste the pros and cons back in 
they'll stay this time. If there are any particular points you object 
too then let me know.

</I>Are you sure? The RDFa folk have been insisting it's RDFa or nothing for 
some time now. On the other hand it has drawbacks which another format 
may solve. This is similar to scripts coming in different formats 
(Javascript, VBScript) and styles (CSS, XLST). It isn't a &quot;requirement&quot; 
per-se, more like a desirable outcome. Perhaps we need a new section for 
non-essential needs but then that's just begging for an edit war as 
proponents of different solutions promote or demote other peoples 
requirements. Perhaps you should be more precise about what makes 
something &quot;required&quot; because by strict definition the only actual 
requirements for &quot;generic metadata&quot; in HTML5 should be &quot;it conveys 
metadata&quot; and &quot;it works in HTML5&quot;.
