</I>

I don't see what's so terrible about showing the user's calendar and the
overlaid events inline, and having the &quot;Add to Calendar&quot; button open a new
page for confirmation. Note that GMail's &quot;add to Google Calendar&quot;
functionality already takes me to a new tab for confirmation, even though
presumably Google could avoid that if they wanted to.

or gives you the opportunity to chat, review and annotate documents, or
&gt;<i> otherwise collaborate with site owners using similar facilities provided by
</I>&gt;<i> gadget operator in their third-party domain, in your capacity as the user
</I>&gt;<i> logged in with said services.
</I>

If these services are limited to specific chat channels or documents that
are associated with the site owner (which can be ensured by the gadget
operator), then I don't see a problem; site owner &quot;UI redress&quot; would be
pointless.


&gt;<i>  That's a terrible user experience, by most accounts, and goes against the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> concept of a gadget; I believe it is often avoided at all costs except
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> absolutely necessary (e.g., login, where the user needs the opportunity
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> verify URL, SSL status, etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe we can make it a better user experience, for example, by allowing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new window/tab to appear as a new pane at the top or bottom of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing tab. That would nicely handle your chat example, IMHO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly.
</I>&gt;<i>

Think it over :-)
