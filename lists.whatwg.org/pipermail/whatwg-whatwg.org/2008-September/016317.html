That has nothing to do with it.

You're saying Java's security model is adequate for what people want to do
on the Web. I say that is unproven since people are not using Java on the
Web. *Why* they are not using Java on the Web is irrelevant.

In fact, people are doing a lot of things on the Web, using cross-origin
IFRAMEs, that are not possible with the Java model.

Or maybe you're not saying that. Maybe you're just saying &quot;the Java model is
secure&quot; and not claiming it meets people's needs. In that case, you may be
right, but that's not very interesting --- it's easy to come up with safe,
simple security models that don't provide the functionality people want.

&quot;He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are
healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
53:5-6]
