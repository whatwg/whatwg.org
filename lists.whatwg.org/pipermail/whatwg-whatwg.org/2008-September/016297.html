The timeout only applies after the &quot;obstruction&quot; is removed, right? Until
then everything is disabled. So as long as the top-left corner of the
IFRAME's viewport is not visible, e.g. because it's scrolled out of view in
the top-level document, the IFRAME must remain disabled.


&gt;<i> we could also quite conceivably make an exception for cases where a frame

Sure, but each such extension add complexity for implementors, authors and
users. Making the disabling happen less often in this way makes it all the
more mysterious when it does happen.

As noted, my greatest concern is having us pick an easy way out that
&gt;<i> essentially delegates all responsibility for compensating for an arguably

Indeed.

IMHO the basic problem here is allowing IFRAMEs to be cross-origin by
default. That causes many problems, some of which you know well, and others
you probably don't (e.g.
<A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2008Sep/0112.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2008Sep/0112.html</A> ). In fact, in
an ideal world, I think we'd default to same-origin restrictions on
everything --- IFRAMEs, images, scripts, etc --- and use a spec like Access
Controls to let sites opt-in to allowing their resources to be loaded from
specific other origins.

In the real world, we can't do that, but I kinda like option 1 because it
(sort of) lets sites opt into that ideal world. (And I'm pushing for all new
kinds of resource loads, such as fonts and external SVG &quot;resource
documents&quot;, to use that approach.)
