If the chat gadget is configured to only talk to the site owner, how can it
be abused? I suppose the site owner can discover the chat nick of a visitor
who otherwise wouldn't want to disclose it. That's a risk that the chat
system developers might very well be willing to accept.

or calendar overlay (&quot;see scheduled events overlaid on your calendar&quot;)

</I>

If it's read-only, again, what's the risk? The user might want to interact
with the IFRAME to scroll and search, but even if those are spoofed, there's
no way for the container to abuse this, as far as I can tell.

I understand there are more interesting examples, but these ones don't seem
to make your case.

Maybe we can make it a better user experience, for example, by allowing the
new window/tab to appear as a new pane at the top or bottom of the existing
tab. That would nicely handle your chat example, IMHO.
