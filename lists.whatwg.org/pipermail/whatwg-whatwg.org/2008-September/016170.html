</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://coq.no/character-tables/mime/en">http://coq.no/character-tables/mime/en</A>&gt; gives a bit more detail, most 
</I>&gt;<i> of which is better kept outside HTML5 itself. However, the following 
</I>&gt;<i> observations can be made:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Opera, Firefox and Safari all handle US-ASCII as Windows-1252.
</I>&gt;<i>     IE7, on the other hand, simply ignores the high bit (as it does for
</I>&gt;<i>     a few other 7-bit encodings, by the way).  Perhaps this
</I>&gt;<i>     alias could be dropped from the other browsers.
</I>
Ignoring the high bit seems like a dangerous security bug; dropping any 
character with a high bit as U+FFFD seems unnecessarily drastic. I've made 
the spec go with the O/F/S behaviour here.


&gt;<i> 2.  Firefox and Opera seem to sniff for text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 (as per HTML5),
</I>&gt;<i>     whereas Safari seems to do the same for text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-11
</I>&gt;<i>     instead [Version 3.1.2 (5525.20.1)].  Bug?
</I>
I believe so.


&gt;<i> 3.  For certain character sets, different browsers map to different, but visually
</I>&gt;<i>     similar Unicode characters.  Sometimes, one mapping is old/outdated,
</I>&gt;<i>     but this is not always the case.
</I>
Not sure what I can do about that.


&gt;<i> 4.  Delete (0x7F) and the C1 range (0x80--0x9F) are handled quite inconsistently;
</I>&gt;<i>     different browsers do different things for the same encoding, and the same
</I>&gt;<i>     browser gives analogous encodings different treatment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (For the early ISO-8859-* encodings, the IANA registry points to RFC 1345,
</I>&gt;<i>     which effectively maps 0x7F--0x9F to U+7F--U+9F, but does not really
</I>&gt;<i>     seem to regard this feature as an essential part of the character set:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         the charset is often coded with both
</I>&gt;<i>         graphical and control character sets.  If the coded character set is
</I>&gt;<i>         a 96-character set, it is tabled with the relevant GL set (normally
</I>&gt;<i>         ISO-IR-6) and with ISO 6429 as C0 and C1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     As for the Windows-* encodings, Microsoft documentation treats bytes
</I>&gt;<i>     in this range as unassigned unless they are mapped to graphical characters,
</I>&gt;<i>     whereas Microsoft products return the underlying byte value in this case.)
</I>
I think the HTML5 spec does what is necessary here, but it may be that the 
encodings specs are vague still.


&gt;<i> 5. IE handles KOI8-U as KOI8-RU, whereas Safari does the opposite. The former
</I>&gt;<i>     is probably more reasonable (assuming that letters are more important than
</I>&gt;<i>     line-drawing characters), but neither is actually correct given that the encodings
</I>&gt;<i>     are, strictly speaking, incompatible.  This issue will of course look a bit different
</I>&gt;<i>     if it can be shown that documents containing the letter &#208;&#142;/&#209;&#158; (only in KOI8-RU)
</I>&gt;<i>     are frequently mislabelled as KOI8-U.
</I>
I guess we'll see what feedback we get on this when testing begins.

Cheers,
