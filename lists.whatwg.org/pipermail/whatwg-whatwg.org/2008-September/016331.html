Yup, by all means, it solves a lot of other problems - and devising a 
*comprehensive* solution (not a new specialty HTTP header to deal with 
IFRAMEs and OBJECT/EMBED/APPLETs specifically), even if opt-in, has the 
benefit of actually reducing complexity for web app developers (in terms 
of custom XSRF / script inclusion checks, etc, that they could ditch).

The issue is, a considerable implementation effort is involved in most of 
these comprehensive designs (given how current same-origin checks, and 
code taking cross-domain actions with no same-origin checks, is typically 
scattered), lots of open questions (e.g., there are some important 
performance trade-offs depending on the granularity of resources, the 
types of requests we want to run checks on; site-wide policies and per-URL 
policies; etc).

On top of that, there seem to be several incompatible proposals from 
various groups, with vendors seemingly not willing to back off. Microsoft 
is pursuing their proposal for cross-domain policies in MSIE8, Mozilla 
devs had another (and every other security researcher has probably their 
&quot;own and better&quot; design in the drawer, about to bring it out the moment 
they are asked for advice).

Bottom line is, I would be very surprised if such a functionality would be 
in a state that can be relied upon by web applications in the next 5-8 
years (more if the abysmally slow MSIE6 -&gt; MSIE7 migration is bound to 
repeat with next major versions)... and I am not entirely comfortable with 
UI redress attacks being around for so long; I suppose most browser 
vendors are not happy too, given the recent / likely upcoming press 
attention.

Cheers,
