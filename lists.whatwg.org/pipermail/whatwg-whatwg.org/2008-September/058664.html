I don't think that's secure. The outer page can set the IFRAME's URL to
contain a #xyz fragment identifier, scrolling the 'xyz' element into view
for any element with id 'xyz'; for many pages, this could allow the outer
page great flexibility in scrolling the framed content to a desired
position. That gives you the same visual effect as moving the top-left of
the container off the screen (especially if you add &quot;scrolling=no&quot; to the
IFRAME so scrollbars are suppressed), so it should be treated the same way.

I suppose you could handle that by disabling input to the IFRAME while its
URL has a fragment identifier. But that doesn't work because AJAXy pages
like to store state in the fragment identifier. So you need to disable input
to the IFRAME while its URL has a fragment identifier that was set by the
outer page. Ugh.
