Note that if we had option 1 (or in general way for sites to say &quot;do not
allow my resources (scripts, images, pages in IFRAMES) to be loaded
cross-origin, except as I explicitly permit via Access Controls&quot;), that
would also protect such sites from holes associated with inadequate
cross-domain DOM security checks.

Default permission of cross-domain loads is responsible for *a lot* of
problems. Allowing sites to escape that would address a lot of problems,
even if it is opt-in. Eventually we could hope to reach a state where all
browsers support it, and most sites request it --- a much saner Web IMHO.

&quot;He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are
healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
53:5-6]
