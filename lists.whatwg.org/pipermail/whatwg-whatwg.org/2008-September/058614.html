It's not about merely clicking something accidentally - it's about 
clicking at a very specific place, as intended by the attacker, to trigger 
a very specific functionality on a targeted page. So I do not quite see 
how random &quot;frustration&quot; / wrong window focus clicks could apply (and it's 
a problem that no application is really designed to handle [1]).

&gt;<i> Many programs become unresponsive during launch and/or setup.  I

That's odd, and I would be willing to say that this is a problem that 
needs to be addressed by your window manager or OS vendor. Window focus 
management and message queues should be independent of any particular 
application's responsiveness to messages sent to it.

I honestly do not recall any situation where I would end up sending click 
events to the wrong application because the focus switch operation I just 
executed seemed to work, but in reality did not (if the application is not 
responsive, it would very likely not redraw itself, which means I would 
have nothing to click on).

Cheers,
