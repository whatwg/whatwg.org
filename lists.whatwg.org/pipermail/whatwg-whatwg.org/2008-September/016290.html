</I>&gt;<i>      to be drawn, but if the parent is not same-origin with the  
</I>&gt;<i> target of
</I>&gt;<i>      an obstructed IFRAME, set a flag to disable UI input to that
</I>&gt;<i>      obstructed IFRAME (i.e., have the browser sink all UI events from
</I>&gt;<i>      now on). We may also gray out the disabled IFRAME (and maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> allow
</I>&gt;<i>      CSS to customize this behavior for specific IFRAMES).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   C) Treat a case where top-left corner of the IFRAME is drawn out of
</I>&gt;<i>      a visible area (CSS negative margins, etc) as a special case of
</I>&gt;<i>      being obstructed by the owner of a current rendering rectangle
</I>&gt;<i>      (another IFRAME or window.top) and carry out the same comparison.
</I>
Isn't this likely to come up any time you have a scrollable iframe, or  
one with overflow: hidden? And why top left but not bottom right?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   D) Once the obstruction is removed (say, a menu folded back),  
</I>&gt;<i> initiate
</I>&gt;<i>      a security timer (500-1000 ms or so) to eventually re-enable UI
</I>&gt;<i>      input to the IFRAME.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   E) Cases where a non-same-origin IFRAME is newly spawned by
</I>&gt;<i>      Javascript, or same-origin -&gt; non-same-origin location updates  
</I>&gt;<i> takes
</I>&gt;<i>      place, should be treated as special cases of the IFRAME being
</I>&gt;<i>      uncloaked, and result in UI event lockout until a security timer
</I>&gt;<i>      expires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   F) Regardless of the aforementioned mechanism, do not permit an
</I>&gt;<i>      IFRAME target that is not same-origin with its parent document to
</I>&gt;<i>      invoke .focus() or to reposition content using URL anchors.  
</I>&gt;<i> This is
</I>&gt;<i>      to make sure that the top-left corner of the page as seen by the
</I>&gt;<i>      user always displays the top-left corner of the actual page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   A potential optimization for D) and E), to minimize any potential
</I>&gt;<i>   impact where attacks are unlikely to succeed, is to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - Permit a short window of opportunity (0.5 second, perhaps)
</I>&gt;<i>     following initial page load, as well as possibly mouse clicks,  
</I>&gt;<i> during
</I>&gt;<i>     which cross-domain IFRAMEs may be revealed with no timer penalty,
</I>&gt;<i>     based on the assumption that immediate and involuntary UI actions
</I>&gt;<i>     are unlikely to follow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   ...or alternatively:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - Disable UI events or initiate timeouts only if cursor is within a
</I>&gt;<i>     certain radius of the uncloaked non-same-origin frame, based on  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>     same assumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Pros:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - Works by default
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - Moderately complex and kludgy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - In implementations, would require callbacks from the renderer to
</I>&gt;<i>     detect obstruction, as opposed to making decisions without this
</I>&gt;<i>     knowledge
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - Further investigation is needed to verify that this doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> break the
</I>&gt;<i>     legitimate and common practice of some sites
</I>
I would add:

- Seems complicated to implement correctly.
- Seems very difficult to validate correctness of the security policy.
- Likely to break user experience of some existing sites.

I do not think this one is viable.

Maciej
