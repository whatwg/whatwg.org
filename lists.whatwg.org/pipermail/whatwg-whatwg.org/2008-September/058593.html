<PRE>Hi Rob,

&gt;<i> You're saying Java's security model is adequate for what people want to do on the Web. 
</I>&gt;<i> I say that is unproven since people are not using Java on the Web. 
</I>&gt;<i> *Why* they are not using Java on the Web is irrelevant.
</I>
I certainly don't know what's on every web-page out there, but when it comes to Java Applets and the security model, the following recent developments may be of interest (especially the crossdomain stuff): -

    As I said, it's an existence proof. Sun's inability to provide decent developer tools (unlike Adobe) doesn't reflect on the capability of the model.


  That has nothing to do with it.

  You're saying Java's security model is adequate for what people want to do on the Web. I say that is unproven since people are not using Java on the Web. *Why* they are not using Java on the Web is irrelevant.

  In fact, people are doing a lot of things on the Web, using cross-origin IFRAMEs, that are not possible with the Java model.

  Or maybe you're not saying that. Maybe you're just saying &quot;the Java model is secure&quot; and not claiming it meets people's needs. In that case, you may be right, but that's not very interesting --- it's easy to come up with safe, simple security models that don't provide the functionality people want.
