Maybe I didn't read very well, but I don't see how the &quot;clause for UI  
action optimizations&quot; would prevent what I described. Could you spell  
it out for me please? It seems to me that the embedded iframes for  
iGoogle gadgets (or similar) will indeed be disabled when scrolled  
partly off the top of the page (or maybe dead to UI events only when  
you bring the mouse near them, which amounts to the same thing). I am  
also not sure what you mean by &quot;the other thread&quot;.

Regards,
Maciej

P.S. I cited this example because it is a Google property, but I am  
sure there are many others like it. We can't expect content authors to  
immediately fix them all.
