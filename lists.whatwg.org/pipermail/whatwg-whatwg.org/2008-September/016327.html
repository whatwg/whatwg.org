Except most of them don't, and just silently break stuff in situations 
that are perhaps even less intuitive to the user. They all have one 
redeeming quality: they are elegant, can be summed up in one sentence, and 
are very easy to implement for browser vendors.

I really see the points that can be made against #3 on the grounds of 
lacking simplicity, and I can quite easily imagine that clear solutions 
have a much greater appeal; that said, I was looking for a compelling 
reason to dismiss the approach altogether, and aesthetics aside, I do not 
quite see it yet; maybe I'm in the wrong, we can probably leave it at 
this.

Your whack-a-mole analogy is of course true, but it applies so much more 
to many ongoing browser security efforts, most notably including 
implementing robust cross-domain DOM access security checks; hardly a 
simple and well-defined component by itself, and proved to be extremely 
complex to implement right in practice, too. Pretty much *any* effort to 
patch the existing design is bound to be in practice kludgy, regardless of 
how much text is needed to outline implementation goals.

Anyway, to move on - dismissing any particular proposal aside, can we come 
up with any other viable works-by-default scheme that would have a 
comparably beneficial net effect (that is, not making unrealistic 
assumptions about the entire world properly implementing a yet another web 
security check, or not being incompatible with gadgets, embedded ads, 
etc)? If yes, I think it should be a fairly urgent and important goal. If 
not, we should at least make sure that opt-in designs pursued do not break 
too many things (e.g., would not be required to be disabled altogether for 
mashups, gadgets, ads - as on all other fronts, we are working to make 
these safer, with cross-domain inter-frame IPCs, cross-domain 
XMLHttpRequest, etc).

Cheers,
