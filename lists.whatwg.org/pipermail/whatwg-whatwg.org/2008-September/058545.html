I'm thinking of MessageChannels, MessagePorts, and Workers as one new
task for implementors, since as far as I know, nobody has shipped any
of these yet.

&gt;<i> So given that, I prefer the current API. I think that for the common

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the benefit of keeping shared vs. non-shared workers as similar
</I>&gt;<i> as possible. However I feel that the complexities that come with always
</I>&gt;<i> using ports for non-shared workers outweighs it.
</I>
In the current design, there are three separate mechanisms to connect
to and communicate with a worker:

a) DedicatedWorker::sendMessage() + DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope::onmessage

b) DedicatedWorker::startConversation() + DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope::onmessage

c) new SharedWorker() + SharedWorkerGlobalScope::onconnect

I would like to combine all of these into one common mechanism:

- Create a worker using either new Worker() or new SharedWorker()
- Call connect() to get a channel
- Inside the worker, listen for onconnect, then receive messages using
the port's onmessage event

This consolidates all the use cases into one common mechanism. It is
true that it makes it a little extra work for the very simplest use
cases. But I think that 'conversations' are important enough to
warrant making them the only way to communicate with workers.
