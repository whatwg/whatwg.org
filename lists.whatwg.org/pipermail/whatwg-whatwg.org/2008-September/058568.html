Seems like this will create a really bad user experience. The user scrolling
around in the outer document will make IFRAMEs in it mysteriously become
enabled or disabled.

Jesse Ruderman suggested this in 2002, more or less, and I didn't like then,
and I don't like it any more now.

Anyway, this option 3) will require extension to deal with opacity:0 and SVG
&lt;filter&gt; attacks. That's probably not hard to do, but it's a warning sign
that it might not be very robust as the Web evolves. It also needs to treat
size changes to the IFRAME as decloaking requiring a UI input lockout. In
fact, pretty much any change that makes a lot more of the iframe be exposed
needs to be detected, including stuff like sudden CSS transform rescaling...
Ugh.
