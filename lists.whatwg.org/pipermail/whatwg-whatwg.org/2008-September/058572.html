Then can't you work around the restriction by scrolling the contents  
inside the iframe and sizing it carefully? (One way to scroll an  
iframe to a desired position is to load a URL containing an anchor link

I think these are laudable goals, but I think you have failed to  
achieve (b).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to see better solutions along these lines to arise on

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Seems very difficult to validate correctness of the security

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This one I'm not sure I follow; very few browser security mechanisms

</I>
I don't mean &quot;validate&quot; in the sense of a formal proof, I mean just in  
the sense of an informal but convincing argument. There are many ways  
to partially obscure or alter the contents of an iframe. Your original  
proposal missed the cases of altering opacity, scrolling the contents  
of the iframe, using filters to alter the frame's appearance, and  
probably more that we aren't thinking of. How about using a CSS  
transform to significantly alter the appearance? Or maybe there are  
pages where showing just the upper left to the user can be effective  
as an attack?

In other words, adopting this proposal would mean signing up for a  
game of security whack-a-mole.

&gt;&gt;<i> - Likely to break user experience of some existing sites.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any particular examples?
</I>
For example, iGoogle widgets would become disabled if scrolled  
partially off the top of the page under your proposal. And even if  
scrolled back into view, would remain disabled for a second. With  
possibly a jarring visual effect, or alternately, no visual indication  
that they are disabled. Hard to decide which is worse.

Maciej
