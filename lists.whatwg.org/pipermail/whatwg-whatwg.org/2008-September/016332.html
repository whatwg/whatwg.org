Could you list these comprehensive designs perhaps?

</I>
Are you talking about cross-site requests here? FWIW, for that particular  
problem I believe all vendors agree on the same server protocol, but not  
on the request mechanism. That is, non-Microsoft will do that by evolving  
XMLHttpRequest (see XMLHttpRequest Level 2) and Microsoft does it through  
XDomainRequest.

However, that's an opt _in_ API as such requests are by default not  
allowed.
