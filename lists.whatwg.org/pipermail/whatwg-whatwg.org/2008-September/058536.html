<PRE>Ping? Thoughts? Anyone?

Jonas, I know you are the one most likely to be affected by this in
the near term. Thoughts?

I know you are generally in favor of something close to the current
Gears API, and generally against the concept of MessagePorts.

But I think introducing a MessagePort object is important for two main reasons:

- Makes the interface very similar for dedicated and shared workers,
which I think makes it easier to use both.
- Makes it easy for developers to set up multiple 'conversations'
(ports) between clients and workers by calling connect(). The lack of
this is a key annoyance with current Gears workers

Note that I have suggested punting on passing ports around initially,
which I feel like is the harder part.

Maybe. One wrinkle is that Window's postMessage is a little different,
because you have to pass the origin you're targeting
(<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/comms.html#posting">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/comms.html#posting</A>).

I do think that the 'conversation' concept that MessagePorts represent
is also useful for cross-window communication and it would nice to
generalize these as much as possible.
