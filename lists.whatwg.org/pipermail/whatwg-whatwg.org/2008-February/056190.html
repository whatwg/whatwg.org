Because the purpose of get/putImageData *is* to get to the device  
pixels, that's their purpose, making them not do that is both bizarre,  
breaks the semantic that putImageData(getImageData(x,y,w,h), x, y)  
will leave the canvas unchanged, and the cost of sub-/super-sampling  
removes the whole &quot;speed&quot; thing that the API was originally added for.

&gt;<i> Their sole purpose is to be a 1:1 mapping to the canvas backing

Yeah, unfortunately we all know the web authors tend to favour the &quot;it  
works now, so must be correct&quot; philosophy -- it's looking more and  
more like i will be forced to convert the canvas from hidpi to 1:1 the  
moment any of the imagedata/toDataURL routines are used.  *sigh*
