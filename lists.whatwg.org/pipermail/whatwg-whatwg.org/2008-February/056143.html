Summary:

   * Missing dashed lines, Hershey/vector fonts, even-odd polygon fill  
rules, and points.

   * <A HREF="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html</A> hence uses  
workarounds.

   * Polyline with no length should result in a circle or square.

&gt;<i> The HTML &lt;canvas&gt; element features seem to be oriented more towards  
</I>&gt;<i> displaying vector-based art than technical graphics; thereby missing out  
</I>&gt;<i> on easily supporting a large number of users. Why do I say this? My  
</I>&gt;<i> first attempt at using the element to support vector-based graphics  
</I>&gt;<i> produced by a program that dates back at least three decades was  
</I>&gt;<i> actually more difficult to implement in a &lt;canvas&gt; element that it was  
</I>&gt;<i> on an HP pen plotter many years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even though I quickly became a fan of the HTML5 element because of the  
</I>&gt;<i> ease with which I could interface with standard HTML documents and  
</I>&gt;<i> ECMAScript/JavaScript, I was surprised there was no built-in support for  
</I>&gt;<i> dashed lines, Hershey/vector fonts, even-odd polygon fill rules, and  
</I>&gt;<i> points. And yet gradient fill patterns, opacity control, image  
</I>&gt;<i> manipulation, and complex clipping regions were all supported (which I  
</I>&gt;<i> consider more advanced graphic features than a dashed line!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet I found I could quickly create server-side applications or  
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript functions that let me get around these problems. The document  
</I>&gt;<i> found at <A HREF="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html</A> shows  
</I>&gt;<i> some simple XY plots containing simple labels, dotted grids, and dashed  
</I>&gt;<i> lines. This was done with the help of a server-side library, but the  
</I>&gt;<i> functionality is all very plausibly portable to JavaScript functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But everyone does not have routines laying around to do sofware-based  
</I>&gt;<i> dash codes, ASCII text strings, and grids. However, it looks like others  
</I>&gt;<i> have already raised these issues except for the topic of points  
</I>&gt;<i> (although I don't think anyone brought them up together, pointing out  
</I>&gt;<i> that they are all common elements of any simple XY-plot utility).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the other topics have already been breached, I'll make my point  
</I>&gt;<i> about points!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is common practice in many graphic formats to represent a polyline  
</I>&gt;<i> composed of a simple &quot;move2(x,y)&quot; or &quot;move2(x,y) draw2(x,y)&quot; as a point.  
</I>&gt;<i> Another common solution is to provide a marker(x,y,&quot;name&quot;,sz) routine  
</I>&gt;<i> that can draw various markers at points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is quite common for a technical plot to be a so-called &quot;scatter&quot; plot  
</I>&gt;<i> where the data is marked purely by marker symbols or points. It is also  
</I>&gt;<i> common to unpredictably have a polyline be just a single point. If dashed 
</I>&gt;<i> lines are going to be supported, it is important to note that almost all  
</I>&gt;<i> dash code models support points as part of the dash-code pattern. Every  
</I>&gt;<i> graphing utility I can thing of supports dotted grids, and so on. Points  
</I>&gt;<i> are so common in technical plots that I strongly prefer that a polyline  
</I>&gt;<i> that has no length is represented as a filled circle with a diameter  
</I>&gt;<i> equal to the current line width or as a square centered on the point  
</I>&gt;<i> with an edge length equal to the current line width.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inconveniently, the current &lt;canvas&gt; standard says to ignore a polyline  
</I>&gt;<i> with no length. This means any code drawing simple curves has to detect  
</I>&gt;<i> such lines and render them as circles or squares or give them a false  
</I>&gt;<i> non-zero length.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If others have reasons for not wanting to render lines with zero length,  
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the solution would be a new graphics state option that would let  
</I>&gt;<i> you toggle between the two behaviors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other surprise was that there was no display list or object  
</I>&gt;<i> definition capability. Simple plots usually don't make much use of  
</I>&gt;<i> these, except to define a marker style, but I find them invaluable in  
</I>&gt;<i> nearly any nteractive
</I>program.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that being said, I find the &lt;canvas&gt; element a welcome and overdue  
</I>&gt;<i> addition to the Web ( I actually liked VML better than either SVG or PDF  
</I>&gt;<i> or CANVAS because there was a common editor, browser, and drawing  
</I>&gt;<i> utility immediately available that supported it, but I'm practical  
</I>&gt;<i> enough to know VML is now destined to be a proprietary MS-centric  
</I>&gt;<i> product).
</I>&gt;<i>
