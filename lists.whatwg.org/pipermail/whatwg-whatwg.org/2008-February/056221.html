</I>
I think most uses of this are actually going to be accepting connections 
from any domain. I don't think it makes sense to require people who are 
just exposing an interface to the world to require people to go through 
hoops like this.

That's an option, but I fear that people would just end up calling 
allowAnyone() (or whatever we call it) in a cargo-cult fashion, 
undermining any security benefit.

Almost all cases I intend to use this API for are open to anyone to embed. 
Game components, widgets, etc, none of them really care who is embedding 
them.

</I>&gt;<i> I like Maciej's suggestion of making it a natural part of the interface.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> // spec says we have to read this first
</I>&gt;<i> var foo = event.domain;
</I>&gt;<i> alert(event.message);
</I>
But then people will just end up doing:

   window.createMessageReceiver(&quot;*&quot;).addEventListener('message', foo, false);

...without understanding what the createMessageReceiver() part is about. I 
don't think we'd really gain anything, except for slightly slowing things.
