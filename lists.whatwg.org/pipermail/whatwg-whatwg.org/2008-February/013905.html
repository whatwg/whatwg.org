</I>&gt;<i> only place in the spec (except the list of RFC2119 keywords) that uses 
</I>&gt;<i> it. The other line* properties don't try define to conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements like that (e.g. they say &quot;The lineWidth attribute gives the 
</I>&gt;<i> width of lines&quot; which is only informative), so I can't tell whether the 
</I>&gt;<i> lineCap one is trying to be a requirement.
</I>
Woops. Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;The lineJoin attribute defines the type of corners that that UAs will 
</I>&gt;<i> place where two lines meet.&quot; - s/that that/that/
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;A join exists at any point in a subpath shared by two consecutive pairs 
</I>&gt;<i> of lines.&quot; - should be &quot;two consecutive lines&quot; or &quot;a consecutive pair of 
</I>&gt;<i> lines&quot;.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;In addition to the point where the join occurs, two additional points 
</I>&gt;<i> are relevant to each join: the corners found half the line width away 
</I>&gt;<i> from the join point, perpendicular to the two lines joining at the join 
</I>&gt;<i> point.&quot; - I'm not sure what that means. Nothing can be perpendicular to 
</I>&gt;<i> both of the two lines (unless they're parallel). For each line, there 
</I>&gt;<i> are the two corners half the line width away from the join point 
</I>&gt;<i> perpendicular to that line, but that gives four corners in total.
</I>
I've tried to explain it better. Let me know if it's not ok.


&gt;<i> &quot;A filled triangle connecting ... with the third point of the triangle 
</I>&gt;<i> being the point of the join itself (where the lines touch on the inside 
</I>&gt;<i> of the join), must be rendered at all joins.&quot; - the &quot;inside of the join&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> bit seems unhelpful and unclear (since it's not the opposite of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;outside of the join&quot;) - it'd be better just to say &quot;... being the join 
</I>&gt;<i> point, must be ...&quot;, since that's the term used earlier for that point.
</I>
That simplification is a great idea. Done.


&gt;<i> &quot;The round value means that a filled arc connecting the two corners on 
</I>&gt;<i> the outside of the join, with the diameter equal to the line width and 
</I>&gt;<i> the origin at the point of the join, must be rendered at joins.&quot; - if I 
</I>&gt;<i> was being pedantic (which I am) I'd say there's two possible arcs 
</I>&gt;<i> connecting those two corners (one clockwise, one anticlockwise), so it 
</I>&gt;<i> should specify which one is meant. But I don't know how to easily say 
</I>&gt;<i> that, and an implementor would have to be silly to do it the wrong way, 
</I>&gt;<i> so maybe a precise definition isn't needed.
</I>
I have tried to out-pedanticise you.


&gt;<i> Should lineJoin='round';moveTo(0,0);lineTo(100,0);lineTo(0,0);stroke() 
</I>&gt;<i> draw a semicircle at (100,0) pointing rightwards? There is no &quot;outside 
</I>&gt;<i> of the join&quot; there, so the spec doesn't say what should happen.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &quot;The miter value means that a filled four-sided polygon must be rendered 
</I>&gt;<i> at the join, with two of the lines being the perpendicular edges of the 
</I>&gt;<i> joining lines, ...&quot; - the miter-polygon lines aren't the perpendicular 
</I>&gt;<i> edges - they're only half of each edge (between the join point and the 
</I>&gt;<i> outside corners). It's probably easier to define the polygon's points 
</I>&gt;<i> (being the join point, the two outside corners, and the point where the 
</I>&gt;<i> two continuated outside edges intersect).
</I>
I've tried redefining this using a triangle.
