</I>
But this isn't necessarily separating sections (chapters). Look at any 
book of fiction -- there's definitely a level of separation that is 
between paragraphs that is within a section.

Indeed I wrote pretty much that before.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I read a lot of fiction books and when I come across a &quot;* * *&quot; it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I read the &quot;* * *&quot; part exactly the same way. And I consider your quoted 
</I>&gt;<i> text to be the header for that sub-section even though it's omitted from 
</I>&gt;<i> the output. I feel that the correct markup to use would be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;&lt;!-- chapter starts here --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h&gt;Yet another chapter&lt;/h&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;&lt;!-- 1st point of view, really a subsection --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h class=&quot;undisclosed&quot;&gt;In the Jack's basement&lt;/h&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/section&gt;&lt;!-- chapter ends here --&gt;
</I>
I don't think that's the structure. I think the structure is you have a 
section (a chapter) and it has paragraphs that are separated.


&gt;<i> In my opinion, this is the correct sematics for the content. To increase 
</I>&gt;<i> excitement for the reader, some of the content is hidden during the 
</I>&gt;<i> presentation. If you feel that hiding the information is part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics in this case (arguably that may be true), just drop all the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h&gt; elements with class &quot;undisclosed&quot; above.
</I>
I think this is trying to fit typical conventions on a mode of thinking 
that doesn't match the typical conventions. I don't think it's really a 
good abstraction to use.


&gt;<i> I think this is an example of why an &lt;h&gt; element shouldn't be required 
</I>&gt;<i> inside a &lt;section&gt; element.
</I>
It's not.


&gt;<i> &gt; To put it another way, sections are things that you can put a title 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to. There's no title you can put to a group of paragraphs separated 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from other groups of paragraphs in the same chapter of a work of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fiction, in my experience. It's just the same chapter, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; narrative exploring different characters or scenes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you can always put a title to a group of paragrahps. It's just 
</I>&gt;<i> that sometimes (often?) you decide to leave it out for brevity / clarity 
</I>&gt;<i> / excitement / whatever.
</I>
If you leave it out, it doesn't have a title.

Too late for that! :-)

</I>&gt;<i> | &lt;/section&gt;&lt;!-- chapter ends here --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Actually, there are situations where the above would be suboptimal, 
</I>&gt;<i> based on how :before and content are defined CSS2.1. For instance, if 
</I>&gt;<i> you put a border around each &lt;section&gt;, the border would be rendered 
</I>&gt;<i> around the &quot;* * *&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Note that if the above CSS is incorrect, it really just proves my 
</I>&gt;<i> point: using CSS in place of &lt;hr&gt; is a pain for webmasters. Note also 
</I>&gt;<i> that without CSS support (or if the separate CSS file isn't loaded for 
</I>&gt;<i> some reason), you probably won't see a separator rendered unless that's 
</I>&gt;<i> the default behavior for rendering sibling sections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This isn't just inconvenient from a styling and markup standpoint, 
</I>&gt;<i> though, although clearly it increases the amount of HTML and CSS you 
</I>&gt;<i> need. The big problem is that it places a semantic burden on authors 
</I>&gt;<i> that currently doesn't exist in HTML. With current HTML, I just need to 
</I>&gt;<i> put the paragraphs from the source text in &lt;p&gt; elements and use &lt;hr&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> where the source text has a visual separator. Doing away with &lt;hr&gt; means 
</I>&gt;<i> at the very least that you're forced to put everything in &lt;section&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> elements when you previously didn't. Add to that the fact that authors 
</I>&gt;<i> now have to know how to style the sections in order to get the separator 
</I>&gt;<i> and you have a serious learning curve.
</I>
I agree.


&gt;<i> &gt; I think you can always put a title to a group of paragrahps. It's just

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Decide to leave it out? You're assuming people even think of it in 
</I>&gt;<i> terms of sections. We've gotten so used to narratives that cut from one 
</I>&gt;<i> location to the next, or go back and forth between places or events or 
</I>&gt;<i> characters, that we don't necessarily think of it in terms of different 
</I>&gt;<i> sections. You're presuming that every time an author creates what could 
</I>&gt;<i> be described as a section, it's done on purpose. In reality, it's may be

</I>
I agree.

My point was just that the above is equivalent to:

   &lt;section&gt;
     &lt;div class=&quot;nohethinotehi&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
     ...

...which is meaningless and for all practical purposes equivalent to:

   &lt;section&gt;
     ...
     ...

...except that there's a structural separation between the two sets of 
inline text here.

&gt;<i> All paragraphs that share a perspective or language or something are

I agree it can be helpful to mark them, and you can use &lt;div&gt; for that. 
The point is that you don't _have_ to, you can use &lt;hr&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; An &lt;hr&gt; is equivalent to a &lt;p&gt; with the content &quot;Meanwhile, somewhere

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it's not. You are connecting it with the succeeding element

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow, if it was, why wouldn't you use a 'p' with that content or an 
</I>&gt;<i> empty one?
</I>
Convenience, clarity.

That's what comics look like. It could easily be its own panel, it's just

Why not include it? It's simple, it has a clear semantic, it's supported

I think that's excessive and unnecessary markup.


&gt;<i> &gt; in fact I think it would be unnatural from an authoring perspective.

</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;!ELEMENT section - - (h?, (hr*|p*)) -- a chapter --&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>       p
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;Baz&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (My DTD skills are rusting, but I think this magic is actually

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's the same as above, just well-formed.
</I>
I think it is unrealistic to expect most authors to think this way.


&gt;<i> &gt; We mustn't fall into the trap of considering everything to be a

I disagree that hierarchy need be the way we mark things up here.

If they're doing it subconsciously, they're not considering their
