I think there is a clear distinction between a section (something that is 
part of a larger work) and an independent article (e.g. blog post, blog 
comment, etc). Indeed I think the distinction already exists on the Web, 
e.g. &lt;article&gt; elements correspond pretty well to what people give 
permalinks to, and &lt;section&gt; elements don't.

Right, the main likely use of the element is as a styling hook.

Yes, I expect ads to be inside &lt;article&gt; elements.

body &gt; * { display: none; }
body &gt; article { display: block; }

What's the difference between &lt;section role=article&gt; and &lt;article&gt;, other 
than the level of complexity?
