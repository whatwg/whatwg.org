Well, &quot;ugly&quot; here actually means &quot;visually just as good as today, but not as
good as the results could be on a high-DPI device&quot;.

Whereas &quot;will get cropped or visibly wrong results tomorrow&quot; could be so
serious that browsers simply have to lock in to &quot;ugly mode&quot; forever to avoid
them. Apparently I'm not the only one worried about that.

Maybe the least sucky option is to leave the API as-is, hope nothing bad
happens, and if it does then we do what Oliver suggested and make
getImageData downsample to ensure a 1:1 ratio, breaking the
getImageData/putImageData invariant but oh well. Then later when the world
is ready, introduce getImageDataReallyThisTime....

(Alternatively: if the user is a Web developer, i.e. has Firebug installed,
always make Gecko's canvas backing store 2 pixels per canvas unit! Just
kidding. I think.)

healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
