Executive summary: no change to the spec has been made.

</I>
I think there is a clear distinction between a section (something that is 
part of a larger work) and an independent article (e.g. blog post, blog 
comment, etc). Indeed I think the distinction already exists on the Web, 
e.g. &lt;article&gt; elements correspond pretty well to what people give 
permalinks to, and &lt;section&gt; elements don't.

Right, the main likely use of the element is as a styling hook.

Yes, I expect ads to be inside &lt;article&gt; elements.

body &gt; * { display: none; }

What's the difference between &lt;section role=article&gt; and &lt;article&gt;, other 
than the level of complexity?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Would &lt;section role=&quot;article&quot;&gt; do? Well, first of all, what would it

</I>&gt;<i> Nope, in XHTML you have to use |xmlns| to define those, so implementing

</I>&gt;<i> Good luck on that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Are semantics the difference? Well, |role| was designed to be purely 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic. However, when you're styling an element, are you seriously 
</I>&gt;<i> going to include a |class| on each element with a particular role, or 
</I>&gt;<i> are you going to use selectors to style all elements with that |role|? 
</I>&gt;<i> In the latter scenario, the selector may be just slightly more 
</I>&gt;<i> complicated, but you only need to write it once and you save on markup. 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, roles end up being functionally the same as predefined class 
</I>&gt;<i> names, with the only difference being the entirely theoretical purity of 
</I>&gt;<i> their semantics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Let's say, however, that we prefer |role| to |class| anyway. Why 
</I>&gt;<i> would we want to do &lt;section role=&quot;article&quot;&gt; when &lt;article&gt; is shorter:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | &lt;section role=&quot;article&quot;&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> | &lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    And you can't argue fallback, because &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; are 
</I>&gt;<i> being defined in the same spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    What's more is that an article is more important semantically than a 
</I>&gt;<i> section, and articles (marked up or not) actually occur with more 
</I>&gt;<i> frequency, so why would we want to demote it two levels in markup?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;What demotion?&quot;, you might ask. The first level of demotion is to 
</I>&gt;<i> make it an attribute:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | &lt;section article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    This, however, would annoy the XHTML folk who can't use attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> minimization, so it's demoted once again to a mere attribute value:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> | &lt;section role=&quot;article&quot;&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Part of the problem with this kind of markup demotion is that new 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes that would have gone on an &lt;article&gt; suddenly need to apply 
</I>&gt;<i> globally to every element, which is cumbersome. (Think &lt;li rel=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> without the |href| attribute and you only begin to understand.) Another 
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that the more roles that apply to specific elements like 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt;, the more broad the semantics of the element have to be to 
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate all these roles. In other words, global attribute values 
</I>&gt;<i> broaden the semantics of elements rather than making them more specific, 
</I>&gt;<i> and thus water them down until they loose their specificity. In the case 
</I>&gt;<i> of &lt;section&gt;, it could eventually become the semantic equivalent of a 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt; with better heading support.
</I>
I agree with the above.


&gt;<i>    Now, consider what would happen if you made it so that &lt;section&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> could only be contained in an &lt;article&gt;. That makes all &lt;section&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> elements sections of an article and reinforces the concept that 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; represents the primary element for content.
</I>
This would be possible, but I don't think we really want to go there. For 
example, I would imagine &lt;section&gt;s in a &lt;body&gt; would be quite common.

They aren't crying out for &lt;section&gt; either, they're happy using &lt;div&gt; 
and classes. :-) But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to improve 
matters. The response to these new elements has been quite positive.

I'm not convinced the data backs up your claim regarding &lt;address&gt;.


&gt;<i> I suspect I could ask the same question of a few other elements as well.

</I>
Simplifying a bit:

&lt;meter&gt; is primarily there to prevent people from abusing &lt;progress&gt;. 
&lt;time&gt; is there to prevent the Microformats crowd from abusing &lt;abbr&gt;.

Agreed.

I don't think we want to require it, but both (with rel=bookmark) are 
already possible and are defined as good signs that that's the link you 
want.

Does the spec work for this at the moment?

I think it is likely blog templates will use it correctly most of the 
time, which would cover many uses of this element. I think the use cases 
for &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; are quite distinct, and that trying to merge 
them would hurt both elements on the long run.
