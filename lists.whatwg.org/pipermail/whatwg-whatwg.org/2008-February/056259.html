No relation. It might be easier for some developers to get it if
associated with the window. I think it's a bit of a rough metaphor
myself, and did not call the object Window in my proposal, but
&quot;WorkerContext&quot;.

&gt;<i>  &gt; WorkerWindow openWorker(in DOMString url);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Can I supply a URL to an HTML file here? Does the file load and parse
</I>&gt;<i>  as an HTML document? Is the document accessible to the worker?
</I>
No the content of the URL must be JavaScript. In fact it must be
JavaScript intended to be used in a worker to do anything useful.

&gt;<i>  Since the whole point of the worker is to do JavaScript work, should
</I>&gt;<i>  this string be a script instead of a URL?
</I>
This is how Gears used to work and it was very inconvenient. Web apps
do not really have access to their source code as a string
conveniently. They could use XHR to request a script file and then
send it into the worker,but why make them do this?

&gt;<i>  How do I pass data to a worker?
</I>
Please see either Ian's or my proposal earlier in this thread for an
example of how this could work. Basically, like postMessage().

&gt;<i>  Is there an API contract regarding synchronization and/or order of
</I>&gt;<i>  execution?
</I>
I think that the API should guarantee that the script is executed on
another thread. I don't think that the API should guarantee that
anything has happened when createWorker*() returns, as UA's will want
to load the script file asynchronously.

However, I think that developers should be able to start sending
messages to workers immediately, before the worker has loaded. These
messages should be queued and delivered when the worker loads.
