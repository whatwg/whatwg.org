<PRE>Many of these points I have no response to and would like to hear  
Ian's take.

For some points, I have answers based on my current understanding...

On Feb 25, 2008, at 12:56 PM, Ralf Stoltze wrote:

&gt;<i> - In 4.3.2, the spec defines the concept of origin, with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> script elements. However, the term is also used in combination with
</I>&gt;<i> browsing contexts and databases. 4.11.2 says: &quot;Each origin has an
</I>&gt;<i> associated set of databases.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what is the origin of a database?
</I>&gt;<i> - the originating host of the script which creates a database?
</I>&gt;<i> - the origin of the document that script belongs to?
</I>...
&gt;<i> - cont'd:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this database feature is limited to scripts running with the same
</I>&gt;<i> origin as the database.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like my English is too limited here. What does &quot;running with&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> mean?
</I>&gt;<i> - the originating host of the script?
</I>&gt;<i> - the origin of the document that script belongs to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this comes down to defining the origin of a database.
</I>
We've had the assumption that the origin is with the associated  
browsing context, and therefore the document the script belongs to.
Clarification would be great...

&gt;<i> - 4.11.3 defines that placeholders simply have to be replaced with
</I>&gt;<i> values from the arguments array. As I understand, this does not per se
</I>&gt;<i> ban SQL injections. Will the spec define *how* to replace  
</I>&gt;<i> placeholders,
</I>&gt;<i> including how to escape and quote values?
</I>
Placeholders are the mechanism the spec mandates to prevent SQL  
injections et al.  *How* seems to be an implementation detail.
SQLite, for example, has the ? + argument structure in place already.

&gt;<i> - From 4.11.3:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A mostly arbitrary limit of five megabytes per origin is  
</I>&gt;<i> recommended.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The session/local storage part defines a quota on a per domain  
</I>&gt;<i> basis. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there any reason for this inconsistency (since both specs are now  
</I>&gt;<i> based
</I>&gt;<i> on the origin model)? Circumventing origin restrictions with  
</I>&gt;<i> subdomains
</I>&gt;<i> is the same for local storage and database storage.
</I>
I believe Ian had an explanation for this when it was raised earlier  
on this list, but can't remember what it was.  :)  Would like to hear  
it again.

&gt;<i> - I've seen some discussion on this list regarding the order of
</I>&gt;<i> execution of statements within one transaction. However, I believe  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> this was related to an older version of the spec (which had implicit
</I>&gt;<i> transactions?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on 4.11.6, step 6.7, I assume the following snippet to always
</I>&gt;<i> execute in order 1, 2, 3?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> db.transaction(function(tx) {
</I>&gt;<i>  tx.executeSql('query 1', null, function(tx, rs) {
</I>&gt;<i>    tx.executeSql('query 2', null, function(tx, rs) {
</I>&gt;<i>    });
</I>&gt;<i>  });
</I>&gt;<i>  tx.executeSql('query 3', null, function(tx, rs) {
</I>&gt;<i>  });
</I>&gt;<i> });
</I>
4.11.3 step 6 states that if an executeSql call passed steps 1-5, the  
statement is queued up in the transaction.
4.11.6 step 6.7 says &quot;move on to the next statement, if any&quot;
I trust this means &quot;the next statement in the transaction's statement  
queue&quot; and that the queue pops statements in the order they were queued.

This means that query 1 would be queued, query 3 would be queued, then  
in the callback for query 1, query 2 would be queued.
Execution order 1, 3, 2

If a javascript engine was truly interruptible, query 1 completed  
before query 3 was queued, and the engine for some reason decided to  
run the query 1 callback before query 3 was scheduled, the order would  
end up 1, 2, 3 - but I don't see that happening with any current JS  
implementation, and I don't know what ECMAScript 4 says about the  
future of JS in this regard.
