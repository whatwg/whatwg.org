<PRE>The original message never showed up, sadly, so the threading's going to be a bit wrong here, unfortunately.


&gt;<i> Currently postMessage is great for sending authenticated messages
</I>&gt;<i> between frames. The receiver knows exactly where each message came
</I>&gt;<i> from. However, it doesn't provide any confidentiality guarantees. When
</I>&gt;<i> you're posting a message to a window, you have no way of knowing who
</I>&gt;<i> is listening on the other end, because the same-origin policy prevents
</I>&gt;<i> you from reading the domain and URI of that window. The window may
</I>&gt;<i> have been showing a page loaded from foo.com the last time you
</I>&gt;<i> received a message from it, but it might be displaying content from
</I>&gt;<i> bar.com now; if you send it a message, you don't whether the message
</I>&gt;<i> will be received by foo.com or bar.com.
</I>
I noted in IRC discussion that postMessage being sync allows a challenge-response protocol to be safely used here, and you can determine the target's identification using domain/uri on the responding message; counterresponse was that's somewhat complicated.  Fair enough; I'm not sure if super-security is the main use case for this feature or not (lightweight collaboration seems more likely to me, but I don't really know), so I'm hesitant to comment too much on it.


&gt;<i> The postMessage API could be extended to provide confidentiality by
</I>&gt;<i> adding some optional arguments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> void postMessage(in DOMString message, [optional] in DOMString domain,
</I>&gt;<i> [optional] in DOMString uri);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If &quot;domain&quot; or &quot;uri&quot; are specified, the browser would only deliver the
</I>&gt;<i> message if the recipient's location matches the specified domain and/or
</I>&gt;<i> URI. (Being able to specify the URI allows sites to differentiate
</I>&gt;<i> between http and https URIs.)
</I>
This seems reasonable enough.


&gt;<i> For privacy, postMessage should be designed not to reveal the domain
</I>&gt;<i> or URI of the receiving window, so if there is a mismatch, the message
</I>&gt;<i> should be silently dropped.
</I>
Silent dropping is definitely good.


&gt;<i> Providing the domain and URI for replies should be easy since these
</I>&gt;<i> values are already parameters of the event.
</I>
True -- problem is requiring people use them, since they're not forced to do so now.
