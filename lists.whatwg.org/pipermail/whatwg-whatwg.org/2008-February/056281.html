<PRE>
I studied the feedback (most of which is contained below) regarding the 
&lt;cite&gt; element and the cite=&quot;&quot; attribute on &lt;q&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt;.

Executive summary:

Though I would likely not have thought the &lt;cite&gt; element worthy of 
inclusion in HTML if it were being proposed today, evidence suggests that 
it has found a high number of fans, relative to similar elements [1]. The 
biggest difficulty with it has been questions regarding its use, for 
instance whether to mark entire citations with it or just the titles in 
citations, whether any title of a work can be marked with a &lt;cite&gt; 
element, and so forth. To this end I have made the specification of the 
element very explicit, and have allowed any reference to any work to be 
marked with &lt;cite&gt;, even fleeting references. I have also clarified that 
the &lt;cite&gt; element should just be used to mark up titles, not entire 
citations. Finally, I have clarified that people's names should not be 
marked using &lt;cite&gt;. While these decisions may not be popular with 
everyone, I believe they strike a balanced compromise between the various 
proposals, and get us the most practical benefit from the element.

The situation with the cite=&quot;&quot; attributes is less clear cut. It's a rarely 
used attribute [2], but when it's used, anecdotal evidence suggests it 
tends to be used correctly. It's also been used by some people to hook 
scripts and styles to, and in those cases, seems to be done pretty much 
correctly. [3] [4] Not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth here, 
I've basically left cite=&quot;&quot; unchanged, though we'll have to add examples.

[1] twice as many as &lt;dfn&gt; total on a per-element basis across a few 
billion pages studied last year, seen on four times more pages.
[2] e.g. under 0.085% of pages had &lt;q cite&gt; in a 2005 study of a billion 
pages; no uses of cite=&quot;&quot; on &lt;q&gt; or &lt;blockquote&gt; at all in this study:

Both of these are now &lt;cite&gt;, possibly with classes to distinguish the 
exact types of titles.


&gt;<i>   - name of important/holy person (sometimes put in small-caps)
</I>
&lt;span&gt; with hCard, or possibly &lt;b&gt; if it's a key word (e.g. in a gossip 
column).


&gt;<i>   - instance of (technical) term

&lt;i&gt;.


&gt;<i> Someone suggested co-opting &lt;abbr&gt; to handle smileys.
</I>&gt;<i> I also think we need an element for expressing things like *runs away*.
</I>
What's wrong with no markup at all for both of those?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; match the default presentation in all visual UAs, nor the resultant use by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; most Web authors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (Specifically, I think the most coherent and backward-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;clarification&quot; would be to restrict &lt;cite&gt; to titles of works, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; inviting authors to use it for names of people as suggested in the HTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 4.01 example would require authors to override &lt;cite&gt;'s italic-ness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; frequently, making them more likely to abandon the element completely.)
</I>
That's pretty much what HTML5 now says.


&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, in the cases where I used cite for that purpose, italics what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exactly what I intended them to be rendered like.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;&lt;p&gt;On a side note, it seems that &lt;cite&gt;fantasai&lt;/cite&gt; is getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really busy with the alternate style sheet switcher (at least I&#146;m
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seeing a fair lot of activity on the bugs involved), so hopefully by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the time Firefox 1.0 gets released it will be back in. And perhaps we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will even see persistent style switching, though I wouldn&#146;t count on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>
This is now explicitly wrong.


&gt;<i> If you really want italics there, with all due respect, you're strange. 
</I>&gt;<i> Occasionally gossip columns have the equivalent of .name {font-weight: 
</I>&gt;<i> bold;}, but otherwise the vast majority of publishers don't give 
</I>&gt;<i> people's names in-line any special styling at all. Even 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://diveintomark.org/css/squares-summer.css">http://diveintomark.org/css/squares-summer.css</A>&gt; has &quot;cite {font-style: 
</I>&gt;<i> normal;}&quot; to reverse UAs' default italic, but people won't be bothered 
</I>&gt;<i> adding that to their site's style sheets if it's easier just to not use 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;cite&gt; in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if &lt;cite&gt; is &quot;clarified&quot; to include names of authors, we'll see the 
</I>&gt;<i> first two phenomena I described a week ago 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> November/002344.html&gt;: most people won't bother using it (because it 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't give them a presentation they want), and those people who do use 
</I>&gt;<i> it will do so overzealously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You just provided an excellent example of overzealous use: you wrote 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&lt;cite&gt;fantasai&lt;/cite&gt;&quot;, but that is not conformant, because you used 
</I>&gt;<i> fantasai neither as &quot;a citation&quot; nor as &quot;a reference to another source&quot;.
</I>
I agree with the above, mostly, and have said names are out of scope.

The class attribute can be used for these distinctions.

This seems to have gone away now.


&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. Using &lt;cite&gt; and &lt;code&gt; is relatively easy with OOo Writer/Web 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but not as easy as pressing command-i. I have used &lt;cite&gt; myself when

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that your preferred editor does not offer a predefined keyboard

</I>
That's backwards. We should justify the elements to the WYSIWYG editors' 
implementors, not dismiss them because they don't find a reason to use 
these elements.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And &lt;i&gt; itself was presentational from its inception, which is one of

By this point, the definition of &lt;i&gt; has gone through several iterations, 
and should now be back to something that addresses the above concerns.


&gt;<i> The problem applies to block elements just as much as inline ones. For

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;any ... groups of name-value data&quot;? Nothing at all. It's semantically 
</I>&gt;<i> useless, and therefore presentational.
</I>
It's structural, maybe, but not presentational (that is, not media- 
specific). It's no more presenational, for example, than a correctly used 
&lt;table&gt; element. It just describes the relationship between its parts, 
rather than the semantic of what those parts _are_.


&gt;<i> One useful line of retreat would be to specify that in the following 
</I>&gt;<i> code, &quot;the state of being happy&quot; is unambiguously a definition of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;happiness&quot; and not of any other subset of the &lt;dt&gt;.

No, sometimes the link will be to a page about the resource. For example,

The Web in all the cases above pretty much is about browsers, and I think

come across the quotes in the first place. But it being about browsers 
isn't a bad thing, nor does it compell us to drop the attribute.

It is not trivial, but it's possible -- so long as the browser distributor

service providers would charge for this, and the browser vendors derive no 
benefit from paying for this service.


As a general reply to the whole idea of making browser clever here about 
getting citations and so forth, I recommend making a browser vendor 
implement this before trying to make the spec require it.

The spec defines what elements should be used for that now.


&gt;<i> (1) Modern English typographic conventions are crystal clear that the

Indeed, but this isn't useful.


&gt;<i> (2) Modern English typographic conventions do not always use italics for 
</I>&gt;<i> the name of a work. For example, by the Oxford Guide to Style (ISBN 
</I>&gt;<i> 0-19-869175-0), the titles of articles, orations, unpublished works, 
</I>&gt;<i> treaties, parliamentary statutes (and in British legal writing, even US

</I>&gt;<i> /suwar/ of the Koran, and rabbinical works that have become nicknames 
</I>&gt;<i> (on this, see p. 541) are not italicized, and those of poems frequently 
</I>&gt;<i> are not.
</I>
That's what the class attribute and CSS is for.


&gt;<i> It is also parochial, since conventions in other languages (of course) 
</I>&gt;<i> vary. For example, in Russian bibliographies, book and journal titles 
</I>&gt;<i> are set in upright script not italics, and in Russian body text they are 
</I>&gt;<i> placed in guillemets, along with picture titles (Oxford Guide, 335-6, 
</I>&gt;<i> 339, 341). In German, roman not italic is used for article and book 
</I>&gt;<i> titles, often without quotation marks (Oxford Guide, 290).
</I>
CSS.


&gt;<i> The /only/ way we will get browsers to display citations in the manner 
</I>&gt;<i> expected by the user is with language-sensitive styling of markup that 
</I>&gt;<i> differentiates the different components of citations (names, article 
</I>&gt;<i> titles, journal titles, page numbers, etc) such as hCite promises to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide. The &lt;cite&gt; element alone is far too coarse a tool for this job.
</I>
Indeed. But it's enough for most authors. hCite can be used for more 
detailed styling and semantics if desired.

&gt;<i> However, I do think it would make more sense to have a different

I honestly this we're far above the heads of most people here already, 
just with &lt;cite&gt; and cite=&quot;&quot;, let alone if we add more markup for this.

I really don't think we're seeing enough evidence that people care at all

people wanted to use citations, they would use it, even if it's not 
perfect. As it is, the attribute barely hits the radar.

If people want to prove that this is plausible, I recommend getting
