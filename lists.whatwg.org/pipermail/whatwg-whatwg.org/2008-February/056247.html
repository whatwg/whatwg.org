You might still need the source in order to navigate it, depending on what 
you're doing. (You can always get a hold of the relevant Window object if 
it can send you messages, since access to Windows is symmetric.)

In general I think a better way to do this would be to use a pipe concept, 
as Dimitri suggests lower down.

This could get really confusing from a GC perspective if a script starts 
keeping track of all its Event objects, since they then each have to keep 
a function alive on the other side, and Events in browsers probably 
aren't set up to do that today. It also seems somewhat odd that this sets 
up an asymmetric relationship.

</I>
This problem exists today with postMessage() too. Do people think we 
should go fully asynchronous?

Indeed.


&gt;<i> I came up with another idea to address the issue you mention. We let

</I>&gt;<i> When postMessage() is invoked a UUID is generated and returned. This

</I>&gt;<i> Both parties can have multiple conversations that way by checking the 
</I>&gt;<i> UUID of the message.
</I>
I don't thikn we want to be doing ID checking. That's icky too. :-)

No, I think that's the direction to go in.

Over the past few days I've been working on something similar:

   <A HREF="http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9">http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9</A>

Would this address the problem?

It would make the earlier example look like this:

   // sender:
   var pipe = window.getNewEndPoints();
   pipe.endPoint1.onmessage = function(e) {
     alert(&quot;got response: &quot; + e.message);
   };
   someWindow.postMessage(&quot;hello!&quot;, pipe.endPoint2);

   // receiver
   window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, function(e) {
     alert(&quot;got message: &quot; + e.message);
     e.endPoint.postMessage(&quot;good day&quot;);
   });

...except that the receiver could be extended to expect messages back:

   // receiver
   window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, function(e) {
     alert(&quot;got message: &quot; + e.message);
     e.endPoint.onmessage = function (e) {
       alert(&quot;got a specific message: &quot; + e.message);
     };
     e.endPoint.postMessage(&quot;good day&quot;);
   });
