<PRE>
This e-mail is a response to all the recent ping=&quot;&quot; feedback.

I carefully took into account all the feedback mentioned below, as well as 
past feedback and comments outside these mailing lists. In response to 
these comments, I've made Referer: be #PING for all pings, and added 
Ping-From and Ping-To to all pings that use the same origin or that aren't 
encrypted. I know this doesn't fulfill everyone's desires, but 
unfortunately the requests from people here were in some cases mutually 
exclusive and so it was not possible to please everyone. If I disagreed 
with something you said, either explicitly below or implicitly in the way 
the specification was changed, please do not take that as meaning your 
feedback was not welcome or not considered.

If the From is SSL, then yeah, it'll only work if it's same origin. 
Doesn't much matter what we do with the To, though, if the source isn't 
encrypted, or if it's not the same origin as the from and ping, since the 
&gt;<i>From site can already do whatever it wants with that URI. Indeed, it came

Done. Please do the honours of registering the headers. :-)

That could work, though really here we're trying to do something that's 
not a URI at all.

Indeed.

</I>&gt;<i> How is that better compared not to send the Referer header at all?

As noted by others, no Referer header is treated as a local Referer 
header, which makes it susceptible to XSRF.


&gt;<i> &gt; The point of it all is to make abuse of ping for CSRF harder, so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard body formats like www-form-urlencoded or XML are undesirable,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So define a custom format.
</I>
As noted by Kornel, this is a significantly higher barrier to entry than 
just using headers.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how this is relevant...
</I>
It seems extremely relevant, as it enables cheap server-side use instead 
of requiring heavy lifting for the author.

Sadly I fear most sites don't check the Content-Type headers.

</I>
It's not a matter of abuse. We need to do a POST request, since that is 
the most appropriate method for this case (we don't want to add a PING 
method, just like we wouldn't want to add a LOGIN method, a SEARCH method, 
a POSTEMAIL method, a SAVEPREFERENCES method, etc). However, there is a 
minor risk with doing a POST request in a new way, which is that 
XSS blacklisting code wouldn't stop the new feature. This is a problem 
whether the Referer header is absent, or whether it contains a valid 
value. Hence, we have an invalid value. This seems emminently pragmatic, 
and not at all something I would classify as abuse.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see two ways forward here. One would be to redefine Referer to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's IMHO not sufficient reason to remove it. It's not broken.
</I>
Lack of use is a reason to remove a feature according to IETF process, 
actually. It's even been used as a reason for HTTP -- Link: headers were 
removed from HTTP a while back for this very reason. (I've since worked 
hard to get browsers to implement it, and we can probably get it back in 
at this point. But that's another story.)

(RFC 2026, section 4.1.2.)


&gt;<i> &gt; The other is that we can define the magic value to be &quot;#PING&quot; instead, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since that's a non-conforming Referer value right now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not conforming, so are you suggesting to use a non-conforming 
</I>&gt;<i> value?
</I>
Right; by using a previously illegal value, we can ensure that nobody is 
relying on it already. (I presume your objection to using a relative value 
&quot;ping&quot; is that it could be misinterpreted by existing implementations due 
to its current definition.)


&gt;<i> Could you please state what problem you are trying to solve, and why it 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to involve the Referer header?
</I>
I believe the problem has been stated a number of times in this thread 
already. I refer you to dolphinling's original e-mail.


&gt;<i> &gt; The idea, as others have noted, is to keep the entity body empty so as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to avoid any issues with servers that ignore the headers and process 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the body (which is relatively common).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you saying it wasn't a good idea to use POST after all because of 
</I>&gt;<i> these risks?
</I>
Not at all; the risks are easily mitigated.

</I>
Sadly this is more than likely to cause problems with transparent proxies. 
It also seems silly to invent a new method, as noted earlier in this 
message. POST is the appropriate method here.

We can't remove it since then it would be treated as a local request.


&gt;<i> Cookies and authentication headers I'm ambivalent about; no one's made a

I've required them, on the basis that removing them isn't solving any 
problems and including them makes it easier to accurately track users.

Good point.

Indeed.

It's not clear exactly what your concern is here.

Ok.

Indeed.
