<PRE>
Executive summary: I made it that if &lt;address&gt; applies to the body element 
it really applies to the whole document. I did not make &lt;address&gt; suitable 
for all contact information; it continues to be limited to contact 
information for the current section/article/page. I couldn't see a 
convincing use case for the element either as contact information for the 
page nor for any arbitrary contact information, and would probably not 
introduce the element at all if it wasn't for the relatively big existing 
use base, which, as far as I can tell, is mostly using the element 
correctly (at least relative to how HTML is generally misused).

Done.

</I>
Arguably. However, &lt;address&gt; is related to sections, so seems to belong 
well there, and &lt;figure&gt; (for now at least) applies to embedded content, 
so seems to belong there too.

</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | As examples (numbered for convenience):
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |  * A general point of contact where messages would ultimately get passed
</I>&gt;<i> |    on to the person responsible for the section where the &lt;address&gt; was

</I>&gt;<i> |    they are not directly responsible for the section in which the
</I>&gt;<i> |    &lt;address&gt; occurs. (Example: Calthorpe Park School's contact page. [1])
</I>&gt;<i> |  * Member's profiles in forum and other social network systems, who have

</I>&gt;<i> |    don't work for the website.)
</I>&gt;<i> |  * Providing contact details of any type for any person or organisation.
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | It may also be more intuitive that an element with a fairly generic name

</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | Are there any implementations which rely on the current semantics?
</I>&gt;<i> | (AFAIK, there aren't.)
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> | So then, should &lt;address&gt; be more general-purpose? (I think it should,

</I>
(Ironically, the example given uses it correctly now. :-) )

Making it general purpose means we lose the contact-information angle, 
which could be an issue...

I don't think we want to introduce a new element for this. That's 
expensive and confusing, and the element isn't that well used as it is.

</I>
It's not clear to me that &lt;address&gt; really is mis-used that much.

I agree that its current semantic isn't used much; but then, neither would 
the more general semantic, and in the meantime we're making a bunch of 
existing pages wrong (unless we make the new semantic &quot;any contact 
information for anything&quot;, which seems more vague than ideal).


&gt;<i> I don't think it's a good idea to invent a new element when the use-case

</I>&gt;<i> implemented anything useful with it. I'd rather drop &lt;address&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> altogether.
</I>
I don't think we can realistically do that. It's used quite a bit.

Not much more likely, it seems.

Could you elaborate on what such an element would mean?

</I>
Is there any great advantage to having an element for all kinds of contact 
information? I'd rather not loosen the semantics without a gain of some 
kind.

This seems like a fine solution to me.

Microformat-like formats provide a way to extend HTML in a way that 
augments the existing semantics of a document, so that you have good 
backwards compatibility to user agents that don't support the classes in 
question, with additional semantics available to those users who are aware 
of the format. I don't think HTML5 will ever be able to completely replace 
all the needs of everyone, nor do I think we should try. Thus there will 
always be a need to extend HTML, e.g. with Microformats.

</I>&gt;<i> a rel attribute (&quot;author&quot;, &quot;contact&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, etc.). Maybe it would be

</I>&gt;<i> signify a postal contact address for the content of the element with id
</I>&gt;<i> cal_08_07.
</I>
It's not clear to me that authors actually want or need this.


&gt;<i> I think it's useful to look at microformats as examples of very real

For the commonly used ones I agree... is &quot;adr&quot; seeing much use in the 
wild?
