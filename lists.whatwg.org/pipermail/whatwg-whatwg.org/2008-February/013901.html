That makes it sound a bit like a working group decision was made, which 
I think is not the case.

...in which case you shouldn't use the Referer header:

&quot;The Referer[sic] request-header field allows the client to specify, for 
the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the

Not sure what a &quot;local&quot; referer header would be.

I'm not sure which mail you are referring to (pointer, please), is it

That states that a bogus (sic) Referer header could be used to filter 
ping requests. There are many other ways to do that, so I don't accept 
it as a valid argument.

Yes, sometimes doing something properly is more work than just hacking 
around.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another advantage of headers is that Apache could log pings without 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> help of any scripts or non-standard modules - LogFormat directive 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> allows logging of arbitrary headers.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems extremely relevant, as it enables cheap server-side use instead

</I>
For the author?

It seems the additional work would be for the implementor of the web 
server, implementing a module for ping tracking. I'm not sure why that's 
considered a major issue.

If you fear vulnerabilities because of servers misinterpreting POST, 
than this would be a good argument for not using POST, it seems.

Ok, we'll continue to disagree on that. But please do not claim that 
there was some kind of consensus for it.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (RFC 2026, section 4.1.2.)
</I>
The reason it was removed was because HTTP/1.1 was advancing on the 
standards track, which requires evidence of things being in use. Next 
time this happens with HTTP/1.1 (draft -&gt; full), questions like these 
will be asked again.

And yes, I agree that Link is useful and needs to get revived in some 
way. People do not seem to understand that it's still part of HTTP.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The other is that we can define the magic value to be &quot;#PING&quot; instead, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> since that's a non-conforming Referer value right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's not conforming, so are you suggesting to use a non-conforming 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right; by using a previously illegal value, we can ensure that nobody is 
</I>&gt;<i> relying on it already. (I presume your objection to using a relative value 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ping&quot; is that it could be misinterpreted by existing implementations due 
</I>&gt;<i> to its current definition.)
</I>
The value is illegal until you make it legal. To make that, you'll have 
to change the definition in HTTP/1.1.

The risk is that recipients that expect a compliant Referer header will 
break in some way.

&gt;&gt;<i> Could you please state what problem you are trying to solve, and why it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to involve the Referer header?

</I>&gt;<i> I believe the problem has been stated a number of times in this thread

Pointer, please.

&gt;<i> Not at all; the risks are easily mitigated.

Apparently we disagree on this.

Evidence, please.

&gt;<i> It also seems silly to invent a new method, as noted earlier in this

Disagreed.

I do not believe a new method is needed (as I still think that GET/HEAD 
would be fine); but it certainly would be better than POST because of 
all the issues we're discussing here.

Please explain &quot;local request&quot;.

The absence of a Referer header means that no Referer information is 
available, not that it's a local request. So please clarify.

My concern is that you're raking ease of implementation higher than 
consistency of specifications.
