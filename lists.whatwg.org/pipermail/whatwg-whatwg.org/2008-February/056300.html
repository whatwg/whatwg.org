<PRE>
Sorry about the three-way cross-post, but this message contains replies to 
e-mails from those three mailing lists. Please select just the one mailing 
list when replying, and trim the quotes below to include only what you are 
discussing. Thanks.

Executive summary:

 * Made it possible to adjust the reconnection timeout.

 * Made it so that the client tells the server what the last message it 
   received was when it reconnects, so as to allow seamless continuation. 

 * Rewrote the implementation processing requirements.

 * Simplified the event stream format:
    - removed the concept of 'commands'
    - changed the comment syntax from starting with a ';' to
      starting with a ':'

 * Removed the possibility to control anything of the event other than the 
   'data' and 'type' of the event.

 * Restricted the events that can be fired to all use MessageEvent.

 * Made 'message' events not bubble.

 * Made the MIME type of the new event stream format be
   text/event-stream; removed mention of the old format's type 
   (application/x-dom-event-stream).


In 2006, Anne wrote, in an e-mail I apparently lost, but which he
later reminded me of:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The event-source element has no DOM interface while it has some 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes that probably warrant one.
</I>
This got fixed at some point.


&gt;<i> * The specification doesn't define when the onevent event handler is 
</I>&gt;<i> invoked nor when the event event is dispatched. They are only defined. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's also unclear which interface they implement, et cetera.
</I>
This should be fixed now.


&gt;<i> * A problem with the event-source element is that the resource is loaded 
</I>&gt;<i> before you can attach event listeners to the document. Perhaps the 
</I>&gt;<i> loading should start after the load event is dispatched? Unless the 
</I>&gt;<i> element was inserted into the document of course (that's actually also a 
</I>&gt;<i> bit unclear).
</I>
If you use src=&quot;&quot;, just use onmessage=&quot;&quot; to receive the messages (and 
only use 'message' events). Alternatively, do it dynamically.


&gt;<i> * Since event sources can be attached using other ways than using the 
</I>&gt;<i> event-source element the Target field should be amended to take that 
</I>&gt;<i> into account. (Some sentences there don't make sense for an event source 
</I>&gt;<i> attached to an object that is not an event-source element.)
</I>
Target is gone.


&gt;<i> * Regarding that, I'd be interested in hearing the use case for allowing 
</I>&gt;<i> any EventTarget to be a source for server-sent events.
</I>
This was requested by Opera... I'll happily drop it if it's no longer 
required. I'd like to only make it &lt;event-source&gt; elements.


&gt;<i> * Event namespaces throughout should be changed to match DOM Level 3 
</I>&gt;<i> Events. That basically means that <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events">http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</A> is 
</I>&gt;<i> gone.
</I>
No mention of namespaces is left.


&gt;<i> * Perhaps RemoteEvent should be replaced with a reference to CustomEvent
</I>&gt;<i>   from DOM Level 3 Events which offers the same type of functionality?
</I>
RemoteEvent is now MessageEvent and this no longer applies.


&gt;<i> * What happens when the event given in the Event field doesn't match the 
</I>&gt;<i> NCName production as required by DOM Level 3 Events such as in the 
</I>&gt;<i> example in section 7.1.7? (It uses the event &quot;stock change&quot;.)
</I>
Nothing.


&gt;<i> * At the moment the BNF does need error handling because you could have 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;;&quot; at the start of a line without any data following (or a new line 
</I>&gt;<i> for that matter).
</I>
That would have been a comment. Now it's an ignored fied.


&gt;<i> * It might be better to replace the BNF with something similar as the 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML parsing specification currently has. That provides a much more 
</I>&gt;<i> clear processing model.
</I>
Both are present.


&gt;<i> * What happens for other line feed characters? Are they treated as 
</I>&gt;<i> fields? Won't that give lots of problems for authors coding in non-Unix 
</I>&gt;<i> formats? HTTP for example allows both.
</I>
CRLF, CR, and LF, are all allowed now.


&gt;<i> * &quot;For each non-blank, non-comment line, the field name is first 
</I>&gt;<i> taken[...]&quot; doesn't cover what happens to command lines.
</I>
Removed command lines.


&gt;<i> * &quot;The ctrlKey field would be ignored[...]&quot; should probably say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;keyIdentifier&quot; as that's what's used in the example.
</I>
That section is gone now.

This seems like an HTTP issue. I'm not sure what we can do about it.

</I>
&quot;Escaping&quot; just consists of splitting on newlines and prefixing each 
line with 'data: ', which is trivial. You get back a string which you can 
process any way you like (document.innerHTML = s, parseJSON(s), whatever).

This is now moot as only MessageEvent can be used.

This is moot as you can no longer create such events now.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The event source resource polling interval cannot be defined by Web

</I>&gt;<i> seems completely arbitrary.
</I>
This is now possible by including a field like this:

   retry: 5000

...which gives the retry interval in milliseconds.


&gt;<i> 2. In section 6.2.4. &quot;Interpreting an event stream&quot; [3], there's a typo 
</I>&gt;<i> in the definition of the Class field, first phrase:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This field gives *is* the interface used for the event, for instance 
</I>&gt;<i> Event, UIEvent, MutationEvent, KeyboardEvent, etc. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correction: remove &quot;is&quot;.
</I>
That section is gone now.


&gt;<i> 3. Why does the specification define &quot;comments&quot; in the stream?
</I>
For three reasons: one to allow static streams to be commented, two, to 
allow keepalive data to be sent without affecting anything else, and 
three, because otherwise we'd have to define lines starting with a colon 
in some other way, e.g. as an error, and that seemed no more useful.


&gt;<i> Given it does, why must the UA fire the message event when a comment is 
</I>&gt;<i> sent? There's no use to do so, other than having an event listner which 
</I>&gt;<i> could figure out &quot;hey, something is coming from the server, maybe they 
</I>&gt;<i> are comments&quot;.
</I>
Fixed. This is no longer required.


&gt;<i> 4. The specification does not make any statements about the security 
</I>&gt;<i> implications of SSE.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are possibilities to flood the UA with events.
</I>
This is already the case with any number of mechanisms (e.g. JS timeouts 
and DOM Events), and I wouldn't consider that a new threat.


&gt;<i> There's also the possibility to exploit security holes
</I>
This is the case with anything.


&gt;<i> or simply to crash the UA when sending specific binary data as 
</I>&gt;<i> application/x-dom-event-stream.
</I>
The spec clearly indicates how all bytes are to be interpreted -- binary 
data that doesn't fit UTF-8 will be treated as U+FFFD. However, that's 
actually somewhat irrelevant -- the user agent should never crash. It's 
not a security concern in the spec if the user agent crashes, since the 
spec already requires that it not crash.


&gt;<i> The connection should be closed/forcefully terminated, in some cases.
</I>
Which cases?


&gt;<i> Regarding security, I would suggest to restrict the allowed chars in 
</I>&gt;<i> field names to a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ and -. This would allow the 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation to terminate parsing the entire line earlier in cases 
</I>&gt;<i> when garbage data is sent. If that's too limited, allow only certain 
</I>&gt;<i> Unicode blocks (maybe from 0000 to 024F ?). [4]
</I>
Why not U+0000 to U+10FFFF?


&gt;<i> For now, the spec requires UAs to support the usage of binary-named 
</I>&gt;<i> fields and values, which is rather overkill, I'd say.
</I>
I don't understand your usage of the term &quot;binary&quot; here.


&gt;<i> I haven't tested yet, but I'm quite sure existing implementations (such 
</I>&gt;<i> as Opera) do not allow *any* field name, which would be valid within the 
</I>&gt;<i> current spec rules.
</I>
This is now in fact required. :-)

</I>
Something similar is now in the spec. Basically each event can include an 
&quot;id&quot; field, and if a reconnection attempt is made, the last &quot;id&quot; field 
received is sent back to the server along with the connection attempt.

This seems excessively complex. What's the use case?

The event now contains the origin of the event-source.

Only synthetic events (MessageEvent events) can be created now.

</I>
XBL2 suggests a &quot;secure&quot; property, IIRC, but this is a topic for the DOM 
Events spec, not HTML5.

Done. :-)

&gt;<i> The major concerns I've heard about section 6.2 include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Unnecessary dependency on DOM Events
</I>
This is reduced somewhat now, though DOM Events are still used.


&gt;<i> - Redundancy with already existing techniques, especially XMLHttpRequest
</I>
Consensus seems to be that this is not similar enough to warrant removal.


&gt;<i> - Complicated parsing of event fields
</I>
This is now simplified; there are only four types of field, and they are 
all either arbitrary strings or integers.


&gt;<i> - Inability to support cross-domain events (without the as-of-yet 
</I>&gt;<i> unimplemented and untested Access-Control HTTP header mechanism)
</I>
This still relies on Access-Control, but that spec is becoming more mature 
so that shouldn't be a problem.


&gt;<i> - Continued problems of the 2 connection limit on HTTP server 
</I>&gt;<i> scalability
</I>
I'm not sure how to fix that.


&gt;<i> I propose that we remove support for non-message events; that is, allow only
</I>&gt;<i> events with MessageEvent interface. This will make implementations easier, as
</I>&gt;<i> UAs will only need to parse the &quot;Bubbles&quot;, &quot;Cancelable&quot;, and &quot;data&quot; fields.
</I>
Done, except I've even removed Bubbles and Cancelable. (I have, however, 
allowed events to be named if desired, though they all use MessageEvent.)


&gt;<i> The critically cool part, however, is that since MessageEvents store 
</I>&gt;<i> their domain and URI origin, it will be safe to allow for cross-domain 
</I>&gt;<i> messaging through this server-sent events.
</I>
The danger with cross-origin event sources isn't hostile event sources, 
it's hostile Web pages sourcing victim event sources from origins that do 
not expect to be exposed, e.g. intranet sites. That's what Access-Control 
is protecting.

I think we want to keep shared resources very localised, and we would 
probably localise that to simply a shared worker environment, as e.g. 
proposed in:

   <A HREF="http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9">http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/messages/0.9</A>
   <A HREF="http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/workers/0.9">http://hixie.ch/specs/dom/workers/0.9</A>

We could just expose RemoteEventTarget to workers.

I've changed the MIME type to allow easy migration in existing 
implementations -- just support both types independently. (Other types can 
also be supported, e.g. for experimentation of new ideas.)

You don't, it reconnects automatically. Do you think we should expose more
