<PRE>Hello

I googled, read the list archive and whatwg forum and did not find 
anything about this topic; if it should have been discussed before, I 
apologize.

Reading the Webforms 2.0 drafts I found that many useful extensions are 
made, but the basic control structure remains untouched. IMO there is a 
great amount of inconsistency in there, as the existing controls seem to 
be inspired by their on-screen representations rather than by their 
functionalities:

Input element:
- Single line text field
- Hidden text field
- Specialized text field (password, new extensions)
- Unique list selection (radio button group)
- Multiple list selection (checkbox group)
- Confirmation / &quot;yes or no&quot; (single checkbox)
- File upload
- Action initiation (button)

Textarea element:
- Multiline text field

Select element:
- Unique list selection
- Multiple list selection

Button element:
- Action initiation

So we have controls with similar functionalities but totally different 
syntax, and also controls with similar syntax but totally different 
meanings / functionalities. A trivial task, as for example changing the 
representation of a list selection from a rad
