<PRE>
Executive summary:

 * I've kept &lt;legend&gt; as the way to mark up the title of figures.
   See immediately below this summary for details on that decision.

 * I've allowed any prose or phrasing content to be put in &lt;figure&gt; 
   elements.

 * I'm made the caption optional.

 * I added examples.


The legend issue:

Right now there are 13 different elements in HTML that define areas that 
give a title or heading or some such for another area. They all have 
issues when it comes to being re-used here. There are also some other 
elements we could use. Here's a run-down of the possibilities, and the 
reasons why they don't work (I've only given one reason, even if 
multiple reasons apply, when the reason is important enough):

   &lt;title&gt;
      Parsing issues in at least Firefox and Safari:

   &lt;label&gt;
      This would preclude any sane way of putting form controls in 
      legends, which would be bad.

   &lt;h5&gt;
   &lt;h6&gt;
   &lt;header&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
      All of these are a problem because if we expand &lt;figure&gt; to support 
      arbitrary prose content, there's no way to tell if a particular one 
      of these elements is being used as the legend or not.

      In addition: &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h4&gt; would have poor default styling in 
      legacy UAs. &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; would also complicate the already-complex 
      outlining algorithm. &lt;h2&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; would, I think, be very confusing to 
      authors, to the point of canceling out any benefit of &lt;figure&gt; in 
      the first place. &lt;header&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;div&gt; all seem like the wrong 
      element, conceptually.

   &lt;legend&gt;
      Parsing issues in Firefox and IE:
         <A HREF="http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%3Cscript%3Edocument.createElement(%27figure%27">http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%3Cscript%3Edocument.createElement(%27figure%27</A>)%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Ctitle%3ETitle%3C%2Ftitle%3E%3Cp%3E...%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cfieldset%3E%0A%20...%0A%20%3Cfigure%3E%0A%20%20%3Clegend%3Efigure%3C%2Flegend%3E%0A%20%20content%0A%20%3C%2Ffigure%3E%0A%20...%0A%3C%2Ffieldset%3E
      ...and the element doesn't appear in the DOM when there's no 
      &lt;fieldset&gt; in at least Safari and Firefox.

This is quite the messy situation.

I think we should discount &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; right 
off the bat, since they would confuse matters greatly. We should similarly 
discount &lt;title&gt;, &lt;caption&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;, and &lt;label&gt;, because the problems 
with those can't be fixed.

That leaves &lt;legend&gt;, or inventing a new element. Both options are 
unappealing.

One of the advanages with &lt;legend&gt; is that while the parse issues today 
are messy, we can fix those (indeed the spec now has them fixed already, 
though we might want to consider making &lt;legend&gt; close &lt;p&gt; tags).

A new element would be a neat solution, but frankly I'm out of words to 
use, and if we keep adding new ways to mark up titles and captions and 
legends and labels, authors aren't going to be able to work out when they 
should use each element. Various people suggested various element names in 
the e-mails below, but from the names proposed it should be clear that we 
are scarping the bottom of the barrel. I'd rather have a cleaner solution 
for something that could be with us for years to come.

I think our only option is to use &lt;legend&gt;, and, while in the migration 
period, have people use markup like:

   &lt;figure&gt;
     &lt;legend&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;legend&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/legend&gt;
     ...
   &lt;/figure&gt;

...with styles like:

   figure &gt; legend, figure &gt; .legend { ... }

The restrictions are gone now. I've also made the caption optional.

This is now fixed too.

Indeed.

Thank you hugely for this research! This is very useful. I have updated 
the spec to handle these cases, and given examples of some of the key 
ones. Let me know if you think anything else deserves an example.

&lt;label&gt; unfortunately would preclude putting more than one form control in 
a legend, which would be a weird restriction.


&gt;<i> Current browsers handle &lt;legend&gt; that's outside a fieldset oddly:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Firefox and Safari drop the element entirely from the DOM when it appears

</I>&gt;<i> - Opera puts the &lt;legend&gt; in the DOM as a void element, and inserts its

</I>&gt;<i> - IE adds a void &lt;legend&gt; element and a void &lt;/legend&gt; element before and
</I>&gt;<i> after the text.
</I>
Opera actually does better than that, but yes, the situation is poor 
today. Hopefully it can be improved. In any case, it can be worked around 
on the short term with a &lt;span&gt; element as noted earlier.


&gt;<i> &lt;label&gt; doesn't have any of these problems.
</I>
It has others. :-)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Lachlan Hunt points out two possible problems with using &lt;label&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     3.a) It may interfere with assistive technology to have labels that 
</I>&gt;<i> don't contain a form control and are not associated with a form control 
</I>&gt;<i> via &quot;for&quot;. Neither of us was sure if this would be a real problem. If 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone could test this, it would be helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     3.b) Authors may have existing styling for label for form control 
</I>&gt;<i> purposes that's not specifically scoped via classes, ids or descendant 
</I>&gt;<i> rules. In this case, they would have to undo it for figure labels. The 
</I>&gt;<i> same issue is possible in theory for &lt;legend&gt;, but the use of &lt;fieldset&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be relatively rare as it does not fit well with modern 
</I>&gt;<i> visual/interaction design.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the problems with using &lt;legend&gt; are more serious than either of 
</I>&gt;<i> the above problems.
</I>
3.c) it would force any form control in a legend (label) to be focused 
whenever any part of the legend was clicked. It would break if you had 
more than one form control.

I think 3.c is more serious than the (temporary) parsing problems with 
&lt;legend&gt;.


&gt;<i> 4) Another alternative would be using a new unknown element. Whipping 
</I>&gt;<i> out my thesaurus, I see &lt;rubric&gt;, &lt;inscription&gt;. Another possibility is 
</I>&gt;<i> something like &lt;figcaption&gt; (to avoid the problems &lt;caption&gt; would cause 
</I>&gt;<i> for figures inside tables), but that wouldn't be a good fit for 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;details&gt;.
</I>
&lt;figcaption&gt; and &lt;detailscaption&gt; and so on just seems like it would make 
the language really complicated.

We've waited years for &lt;figure&gt;, can't we wait a few more while browsers 
get their act together in their parsers?

Actually I think legend is a more accurate name than label for a figure. 
But that may be my dialect.


&gt;<i> Check out dublin core: &lt;description&gt; [1] and &lt;title&gt; [2] (already an

Sadly this isn't a description, and &lt;title&gt; has even bigger parsing 
problems.

Yeah, it's a big mess. (&lt;figure&gt; inside &lt;fieldset&gt; will happen rarely, 
though, so that particular issue isn't a big deal.)


&gt;<i> For figure captions:
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;figcaption&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;cap&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;capt&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;cptn&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;description&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;desc&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;tag&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;tagline&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;caption2&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For details:
</I>&gt;<i> * &lt;detailslabel&gt;
</I>
I'm really worried about adding more elements. We already have so many 
that mean &quot;caption&quot;. People will just get more and more confused.

I'd agree, if it wasn't for the sheer number of elements we already have 
for this very semantic.

Interesting.

This is fixed now, right?
