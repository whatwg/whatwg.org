<PRE>
The &lt;m&gt; element received a _lot_ of feedback; indeed as I write this the 
subject line with the third most unanswered e-mails in my issues list is 
simply &quot;The m element&quot;.

Executive Summary: Despite a lot of feedback suggesting dropping the 
entire element, I considered the number of use cases for the element, and 
the number of high-profile sites working around the lack of such an 
element, to be enough reason to keep the element for now. However, I did 
act on the feedback suggesting that the element be renamed; the element is 
now called &lt;mark&gt;. I also significantly updated the description of the 
element and added a number of examples. I hope these changes clarify how 
one uses the element.

While it is true that few people have explicitly requested this element, 
the same could be said for almost all the other new elements in HTML5. For 
new elements we have to consider what people are doing, as well as what 
they are asking for.

The semantic in question isn't the kind of thing I would imagine would fit 
the microformat ethos.

</I>
I think the semantic in question is distinct enough from the existing 
elements that it isn't just splitting hairs. Historically the 
specifications have been very vague on how these elements are used, but 
with HTML5 we can define these strictly enough that it should be possible 
for people to pick up the right use. (I disagree that the status quo of 
confused authors is inevitable, given that the specs they would have been 
referring to are at least as confused themselves.)

The difference between the semantic of &lt;b&gt; and the semantic we are 
discussing here is that while &lt;b&gt; indicates key words in the text, 
independent of the reader, the element we are discussing here is 
highlighting key words theoretically relevant for the user.

&lt;u&gt; is currently gone due to lack of use cases, but &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are

I think the arguments here arguing that there are clear differences

As James says, there are a number of uses of this element. I think most 
uses of them seem to use the &quot;style&quot; attribute directly, which wouldn't 
show up, and which, ironically, means it would be even better to provide 
an alternative element with specialised UI (if they use it).
