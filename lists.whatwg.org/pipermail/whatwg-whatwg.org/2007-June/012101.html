That layout may not be the optimal layout for everyone (even perhaps Google,
as it was a choice made before considering offline applications and how they
will share information, etc.).  The desire to share data and code could lead
people to put all apps under a sigle domain.

As for the burden to put apps in their own domain -  First it seems to be an
unnecessary requirement. I build an app, I choose a URL as I normally would
and I would hope everthing would work out fine. Second it doesn't work well
for environments where access to the domain is not possible. Consider the
case of internal corporate apps. People post new web apps using their
'individual' internal corporate web server. They can choose whatever name
they want. What they don't have is access to the domain in order to do
this.  I grant that this scenario is currently not well supported by the
Gear's security model (something that I believe will need to change), but it
is a real use of technology.

</I>&gt;<i> If it is, then I would suggest simply allowing consistency to be
</I>&gt;<i> partitioned by directory as well. I'm not sure of the best way for the
</I>&gt;<i> server to configure that, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm still not sure why not have consistency enforced at the application
level. This way an application can pull code from whereever it needs to
regardless of the directory structure.
