I disagree. The third item in the list describes the solution which I had in
mind:

&quot;Blocking access to the top-level domain
(&quot;public&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#public0">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#public0</A>&gt;&quot;)
storage areas: user agents may prevent domains from storing data in and
reading data from the top-level domain entries in the
globalStorage&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#globalstorage">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#globalstorage</A>&gt;object.
For example, content at the domain
www.example.com would be allowed to access example.com data but not  comdata.&quot;

That effectively restricts the storage to a single domain and is in line
with how cookies work today.

Have any browser makers expressed opinions on which of them they are
&gt;<i> planning to implement?
</I>

That's a good question, but I'm not sure if it's one that the WHATWG can
answer? I do know that Firefox 2 already implements the Storage spec. Info
on that here:

<A HREF="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:Storage">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:Storage</A>

I wasn't able to find any docs that describe the Storage security model used
in Gecko, so I ran a few tests. What I found was that any attempt to access
globalStorage[''] or globalStorage['com'] from the context of a website
resulted in a security error. You can try the test for yourself here:

<A HREF="http://java.dnsalias.com/temp/storage.html">http://java.dnsalias.com/temp/storage.html</A>

After loading the page, open the Javascript Error console. You should see a
security exception listed.

I presume that the restrictions are relaxed for signed pages as well as
those that are run at a higher privilege level. (e.g. XULRunner apps.)

Is there a document somewhere outlining the actual benefits of this
&gt;<i> feature, even as potentially restricted?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The specification has this explanation: &quot;Web applications may wish to store
megabytes of user data, such as entire user-authored documents or a user's
mailbox, on the clientside for performance reasons.&quot;

And it's not just performance reasons. If I wanted to work on a Google
Spreadsheet on a plane, for example, offline caching of the data would allow
me to continue my work without an internet connection. Then when I reconnect
to the internet and load the document, the client would sync its stored
changes with the server.

My understanding is that this is Google's justification for their new
&quot;Gears&quot; product. Which is basically the same as the WHATWG Storage +
Database specifications, but with auto-sync and an incompatible API.

Thanks,
Jerason
