In my example I had the author using an IDE that is localised already for  
known elements. People really do this. The ones I am aware of actually use  
japanese or arabic, and do it for convenience - although in principle they  
can normally work with some kind of latin script, they are not very  
familiar with english, and would be as happy to use &quot;inbed&quot; as &quot;embed&quot;,  
and happier with something that they recognise more instinctively. China,  
in particular, is quite keen on localising everything. India seems more  
inclined to do so, as well, as time goes on and they become a more  
important player in technology.

The scenario does require that the language is extensible - this can be  
done with XML, presumably including the XML version HTML 5, but not HTML 5  
as currently proposed.

&gt;<i> Considering Arabic script and the like, the time is probably near when we

Thanks for your polite and constructive reply.
