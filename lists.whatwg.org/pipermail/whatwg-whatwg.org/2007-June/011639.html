Just referring to the event defines the name, so that's a non-issue.

</I>
That is independent of the name, and determined when you fire the event. 
There are some events that sometimes bubble and sometimes don't, for 
instance. In fact I would say that it's up to the spec that fires the 
event to define whether they bubble, have default actions, etc. 


&gt;<i> DOM 3 Events defines this for the &quot;load&quot; event for instance.

I would argue that it shouldn't.


&gt;<i> It seems to me that &quot;load&quot; and &quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot; can both be defined in

</I>
I guess it makes sense to have a non-normative (because there's nothing 
to be normative about) repository somewhere that lists event names and 
which specs are using them, so that specs can remain consistent on the 
matter. But I don't think DOM3 Events need be it; it's a lot of work. For 
example, all the HTMLMediaElement events would need to be added to the 
list.

I really don't think that my input had much influence on the matter. This 
is the sum total of what I said about it:

|<i> All in all I'm in agreement with the sentiment on this thread that 
</I>|<i> DOMContentLoaded's use cases are unconvincing.
</I>
...and that still stands. However, a lot of people have indicated that 
there _are_ use cases, and that they really want support for this. Since 
browsers support it and aren't going to _remove_ support for it, we have 
to specify it, and hence it gets added to the spec.
