It's not that it's a fight that can't be won, it's just that the arguments 
I've heard from people about why they think we shouldn't have versioning 
information are more convincing than the arguments from those who think we 
should have versioning information.

(The arguments against versioning appeal to evidence that having 
versioning actively harms the Web and threatens the ability for 
competiting browsers to exist; the arguments in favour tend to be more 
about solving theoretical problems. It's an easy choice, really.)


&gt;<i> If there is no versioning system, there is no way to specify an 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;alternate standard.&quot;
</I>
Whatever happens, there'll only be one successful HTML standard on the 
Web. We don't need a technical means to chose between them, the market 
will do that for us.

In any case, we just have the one standard right now (since the W3C and 
WHATWG are working on the same document).
