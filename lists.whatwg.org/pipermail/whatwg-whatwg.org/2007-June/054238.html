</I>&gt;<i> Support for the &lt;video&gt; element without a common codec may well become

</I>

A &lt;video&gt; element that is natively part of html and has a standard set
of API functions will enable applications that are impossible today,
even with embedded elements such as flash.

Imagine e.g. a mash-up of video extracts from several video hosting
sites where you take an offset from each and put them together in a
new video without having to manually edit that content. Only if all
videos are in the same format and all hosting sites provide the same
API will such a mashup be possible.

I for one see the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements as one of the main
novelties that make html5 important.

If we put a requirement into the spec for a common baseline codec and
the value of that can be demonstrated through several hosting sites -
e.g. wikipedia, archive.org - and new applications will be
demonstrated with the new &lt;video&gt; element - then I think there is a
reason to go forward.

In any case: plugins can be written for IE and for Safari that make
them support Ogg Theora and the &lt;video&gt; tag, even if neither Microsoft
nor Apple will be distributing them. And as a work-around at the
beginning, java applets such as cortado enable Ogg Theora support even
without a need for native support.

Where there's a will, there's a way. We have to do what is right, not
what is politically acceptable.

Regards,
Silvia.
