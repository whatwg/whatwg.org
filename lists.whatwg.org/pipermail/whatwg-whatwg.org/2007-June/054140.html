Agreed.

The spec doesn't allow anything purely for backwards compatibility.


&gt;<i> I would like a spec that clearly says that some ways of marking up

</I>
Frames are out (except &lt;iframe&gt;, which I don't really see as being a 
problem, though let me know if I'm wrong on this). Tables for layout are 
non-conforming, though I hope to make this clearer in due course. I've 
added a note to myself in the spec to remind myself of this.

The media-specific evils of style=&quot;&quot;, if it is allowed at all, will indeed 
be called out explicitly.


&gt;<i> - Empty p-elements, or p elements containing only &nbsp;
</I>
The former will be allowed, as there are valid use cases (usually 
involving script). I'd like to ban the latter, but I'm not sure how to do 
it. Any suggestions?


&gt;<i> - A table within a table cell (Has this ever been used for anything but 
</I>&gt;<i> layout?)
</I>
There are valid uses of that, though they are rare. But layout tables in 
general will be discouraged (and are non-conforming).


&gt;<i> - Iframes
</I>
Why are they bad?
