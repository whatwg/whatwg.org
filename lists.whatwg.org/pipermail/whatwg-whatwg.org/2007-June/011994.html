I really do not understand why these uses of the double-dot diacritic
should be considered as instances of the di&#230;resis (see below).

&gt;<i> the dieresis is not a double accent
</I>
I never said &quot;double accent&quot;, but you are right in pointing out that I should have
called it a double-dot diacritic rather than a double-dot accent, since
-- strictly speaking -- the only accents are acute, grave and circumflex.

&gt;<i> To make it explicit and plain: the dieresis is a diacritical mark that has
</I>&gt;<i> no intrinsic phonetic connotation, although it is used mostly for separating
</I>&gt;<i> vowels;
</I>
As you may know, di&#230;resis derives from the Greek verb &#948;&#953;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957; (diairein),
which means &#8220;to divide&#8221;, and it does indeed have an intrinsic meaning.

According to the OED, a di&#230;resis is &#8220;[t]he sign (&#168;) marking [a phonological di&#230;resis], or,
more usually, placed over the second of two vowels which otherwise make a
diphthong or single sound, to indicate that they are to be pronounced separately.&#8221;

Similarly, umlaut is defined as &#8220;[t]he diacritical sign (&#168;) placed over a vowel to
indicate that [umlaut] has taken place.&#8221;

Hence, the use of either term when the double-dot diacritic is performing
another linguistic function is equally abusive.

&gt;<i> the phonetic meaning of umlaut is generic and well-defined by its
</I>&gt;<i> very name and it does not apply to the vowel I.
</I>
Indeed. German umlaut notation is further restricted, and I am not quite sure
if the phonetic phenomenon applies to y either, but this is rather far off topic.

&gt;<i> I did not intend to make HTML support all possible linguistic intricacies;
</I>&gt;<i> I only wanted to eliminate the common nonsense of denoting &#239; with &amp;iuml;
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>  I only want the true umlaut to be distinct, not as a code point but as an entity name.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> It would be up to the author to determine whether &amp;uuml; or &amp;utrema;
</I>&gt;<i> is appropriate; both entities should denote the same character.
</I>
Do you really think it is a good idea to introduce twelve new aliases
that do not work in current browsers, do not make the language more
expressive and require authors to make meaningless decisions?
(Is Slovak &#228; borrowed from German [it is pronounced &#230; or &#603;] and
therefore &amp;auml; or does it have another origin? Should we use
&amp;atrema; by default? How about Pinyin &#252;? Swedish words that contain
an &#246; as a result of umlaut vs those that contain it for a different reason?)

Trema or di&#230;resis might have been a better choice than umlaut as a generic name,
since umlaut does not apply to all Latin vowels, but it is really too late to fix this now.

The canonical example in Dutch seems to be co&#246;rdinatie, see
<A HREF="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trema_in_de_Nederlandse_spelling">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trema_in_de_Nederlandse_spelling</A> .

&gt;<i> Something along the lines of zo&#246;logy, but actually required?
</I>
Well, such spellings are &quot;actually required&quot; in some varieties of English.
&#8220;The New Yorker mandates that authors must co&#246;perate to re&#235;ducate our
readership.&#8221; &#8212; allegedly from the magazine&#8217;s style manual.

I have no idea why you consider capharna&#252;m to be invalid (if this is what you imply),
but perhaps Spanish ping&#252;ino and Dutch re&#252;nie will be more convincing examples.

French dictionaries require loan-words like angstr&#246;m, f&#252;hrer and l&#228;nder (plural
of land) to be spelt with an umlaut, but these are of course too rare for
a differentiation tr&#233;ma/umlaut to have developed, and I would imagine
German imports with umlaut to be only slightly more common in Dutch.

It would be interesting to see whether 19th-c. German actually made a
distinction between umlaut on a, o, u and di&#230;resis on e, i (e.g., Rhombo&#239;d),
but I do not know how consistently the di&#230;resis was used, and words
requiring it are typically foreign words that, unlike the rest, will not have
been printed in Fraktur...
