True, authors will probably notice there is something wrong (a maxlength 
that was supposed to be a minlength or another mistake), but that 
doesn't mean they know how to correct this mistake.

The 'fun' thing is that here the specs take the strict/rigid route in 
order to make things more clear for the authors, but on other occasions 
a loose aproach is chosen for exactly the same reason as 'strict' would 
make things harder.


&gt;<i> HTML5 tries to add attributes (and elements) only when really needed.
</I>
Well, you might wonder whether &lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;&gt; adds something to 
type=&quot;number&quot; that is really needed.


&gt;<i> Authors have survived the lack of minlength in HTML4, why couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> they survive its lack in HTML5 too? They're not forced to use pattern=
</I>&gt;<i> after all (particularly if they don't understand it).
</I>
They even survived the lack of HTML5. Still, we're discussing its 
features ;-)

Authors that want to define a minimal length are (=will be) in fact 
forced to use the pattern attribute according to the current specs.


&gt;<i> You're not forced to use new features of HTML5 ;-)
</I>You don't know my boss. As soon as he finds out about things like the 
&lt;canvas&gt; element, or the new Web Forms features... oh boy.


&gt;<i> And I'm not at all against a minlength= attribute either.
</I>You have a strange way of showing that ;-)

&gt;<i> I just try
</I>&gt;<i> to find arguments to resist adding yet another attribute to HTML ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, I try to give arguments that might have already been given
</I>&gt;<i> (I don't know, maybe minlength= was already requested some day) and
</I>&gt;<i> would have lead to what's in the spec today (i.e. no minlength=
</I>&gt;<i> attribute)
</I>But why, if you're _not at all_ against it?

I'm not sure either whether this was requested earlier already. And I 
think I know what the arguments against it are and I believe to 
understand the logics underneath them. But it's for the sake of the 
authors that I request this feature as I believe that regular 
expressions are just too complicated for most of them.


cheers,
Sander
