<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Gears returns an error when you first try to setup an ambiguous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you do that when an ambiguity is discovered during a manifest update?
</I>
We hadn't thought about the case where the ambiguity is caused by a
manifest's new contents.  Thanks for pointing that out.

&gt;<i> what's the use case for &quot;remove&quot;
</I>
Without it, once you put a given URL in the ResourceStore, it would be
served from there forever.  Also, remember that the ResourceStore
doesn't auto-update URL contents like the ManagedResourceStore does.

&gt;<i> what's the use case for ... &quot;rename&quot; and &quot;copy&quot;
</I>
Sometimes you want to return the contents of one real-world URL (like
<A HREF="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</A>) in response to a different URL request (like
<A HREF="http://example.com/?offline=1">http://example.com/?offline=1</A>).  The &quot;rename&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; methods let
you do that.

There may be a better way to expose this.  As an example: Gears could
have functions to (1) return a handle to a page's contents, and (2)
let you bind a handle to any URL request you like.

&gt;<i> Also, what motivates the provision of multiple named stores
</I>&gt;<i> with independent enable/disable control?
</I>
Allowing multiple named stores is a convenience for developers, just
like allowing multiple named databases.

I don't have a great answer for the independent enable/disable
control.  Maybe this is something that should be removed until there
is a stronger need for it.

&gt;<i> What about opening stores --- is that some sort of approximation to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;logging in&quot;? What does it actually do, given that &quot;the URLs contained
</I>&gt;<i> in a store are eligible for local serving without requiring the application
</I>&gt;<i> to open the store&quot;? When are stores closed?
</I>
The main reason for create + open is so you can tell if a store
already exists.  It's a bit like Win32 CreateFile + OpenFile in that
respect.

open + isPresent would be another option.  Or maybe just 'open', until
there is a strong need for isPresent.  The Database API doesn't have
isPresent, which is another argument for removing it for now.

As you guessed, there is no notion of a store being &quot;closed&quot;.
