Yes, so that all consumers consume the HTML interoperably.


&gt;<i> So let's rephrase this question: will there be a conformance class for

</I>&gt;<i> that these consumers may not even have a DOM or a Javascript engine).
</I>
Assuming you are referring only to parse errors, and not other kinds of 
conformance errors, then yes, the spec already allows you to abort when 
you hit a parse error.

</I>
No. You can reject, and you can do what the spec says. But you can't be 
conforming while doing something that contradicts what the spec says.


&gt;<i> At least that's how I interpret the original intent - it means tools in 
</I>&gt;<i> systems with guaranteed document conformance (i.e. not taking input from 
</I>&gt;<i> the general web) could be simplified while still claiming to be 
</I>&gt;<i> conformant and still being interoperable with other such tools.
</I>
Yes, you can do that.


&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work#non-scripted">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work#non-scripted</A> already 
</I>&gt;<i> defines UA conformance when there's no scripting, which seems to cover 
</I>&gt;<i> those cases.
</I>
Indeed.

</I>
If you want a generic system that handles all HTML content, you can't do 
it with a pure streaming SAX system.

</I>
That's allowed (it's out of scope, in fact). It's just a post-process.


&gt;<i> The parsing spec allows a Draconian response to parse errors. Hence, if you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Emit events as the parse progresses and halt on errors that require 
</I>&gt;<i> non-streamable recovery.
</I>
Indeed.

</I>
&lt;title&gt; still gets moved back, but yeah, in certain cases this might work. 
(You could also do it by having specific events for &lt;title&gt;.)
