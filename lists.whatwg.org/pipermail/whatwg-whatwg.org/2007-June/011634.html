</I>&gt;<i> The reason I designed it this way was that it felt like the least

</I>&gt;<i> current DOM. I.e. it doesn't matter what the DOM looked like before, or 
</I>&gt;<i> how it got to be in the current state, it only matters what's in the DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> now. [...]
</I>
&gt;<i> For &lt;script&gt; things are a lot worse. If the contents of a &lt;script&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> element is changed it is impossible to 'drop' the script that was there 
</I>&gt;<i> before. Once the contents of a &lt;script&gt; has executed, it can never be 
</I>&gt;<i> unexecuted. And since we can't undo what the &lt;script&gt; has already done, 
</I>&gt;<i> it feels weird to redo the new thing that you're asking it to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing that would be weird would be inline scripts. How would the
</I>&gt;<i> following behave:
</I>&gt;<i> s = document.createElement('script');
</I>&gt;<i> document.head.appendChild(s);
</I>&gt;<i> for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
</I>&gt;<i>   s.textContent += &quot;a&quot; + i + &quot; += 5;&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you reexecute the entire script every time data was appended to 
</I>&gt;<i> the script? Would you try to just execute the new parts? Would you do 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing? IE gets around this problem by not supporting dynamically 
</I>&gt;<i> created inline scripts at all, which I think is a really bad solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I opted for 'killing' script elements once they have executed, they 
</I>&gt;<i> become in effect dead elements. This felt simple and consistent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean when you say you need to &quot;keep track of them, 
</I>&gt;<i> and remove them from the document again&quot;. All you need to do every time 
</I>&gt;<i> you want to execute a script is to insert a new DOM element in the head 
</I>&gt;<i> of your page. It's not going to be a problem with having too many 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt; elements in the document unless you start executing millions of 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, at which point you'll have bigger performance issues.

I agree with Jonas here (and I apologise for not seeming to have the other 
side of this conversation; I assume I put it into another folder and will 
get to it in due course).

I haven't changed the spec, since the spec describes what Jonas says.

Please let me know if you disagree with this, especially if you find pages 
that break because of it.
