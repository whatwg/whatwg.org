I regret that we (like most companies) cannot 
comment on possible pending litigation 
(fascinating as some of these cases are).  Sorry.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It's also quite interesting that different portions of MPEG-4,
</I>&gt;<i>including different sections of video and audio are licensed
</I>&gt;<i>separately, so what this means is that any vendor willing to support
</I>&gt;<i>MPEG-4 for &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; has to locate every patent holder and
</I>&gt;<i>pay them.
</I>
Yes, video and audio are separate;  but there are 
also pools that simplify the position.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Oh, and will you look at this, Apple, Inc. holds one the patents!  US
</I>&gt;<i>6,134,243 [4].  So Apple gets money for every single license sold.
</I>
It's nice that you have done the research and 
found what we are doing with our patents. Or are 
you guessing?

&gt;<i>How nice.  They are attempting to lock vendors into MPEG-4
</I>
Pardon?  We use it and are happy when others do. 
*We* are not asking more.  It's not us who are 
proposing any lock or mandate;  you might check 
the Ogg community for that suggestion.  Also, you 
might wonder whether licensing of standards is a 
net income or cost for us.

&gt;<i>and get
</I>&gt;<i>money from licenses in the process.  Apple, Inc. is no better than
</I>&gt;<i>Microsoft.
</I>
And Ivo is no better than Sylvia.  This isn't a 
very helpful comparison.  (Actually, I know 
Sylvia but regret that I don't think I have ever 
met you).
