</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agree on all those.

&gt;<i> - One major issue that we found here was that lots of existing
</I>&gt;<i> applications serve different resources at the same URI depending on
</I>&gt;<i> who is logged in. We could ask these applications to redesign so that
</I>&gt;<i> they don't do that, but we would prefer to not have to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Understood, but this seems to add substantial complexity to the model. Is
</I>it really a big deal to restrict users to one login available offline? A
browser can of course support multiple profiles or something similar to
address that use case without complicating the development model.

&quot;Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred
denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back,
so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?&quot;
Simon replied, &quot;I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.&quot; &quot;You
have judged correctly,&quot; Jesus said. [Luke 7:41-43]
