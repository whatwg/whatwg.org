Seeming they are already under risk from what they already support,  
what advantage do Apple get by supporting more codecs, therefore  
opening up themselves to further risks?

&gt;<i> It's also quite interesting that different portions of MPEG-4,

No, they don't, it all goes through MPEG-LA.

&gt;<i> Oh, and will you look at this, Apple, Inc. holds one the patents!  US

</I>&gt;<i> How nice.  They are attempting to lock vendors into MPEG-4 and get

So a company which owns a patent on a standard that can bought and  
read at freedom is just as bad as a company which owns a patent on a  
standard that has absolutely no public documentation? Also, a large  
part of this topic has been around H.264, Apple holds no known  
patents affecting H.264.
