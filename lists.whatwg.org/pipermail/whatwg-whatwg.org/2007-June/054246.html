Our current plan is to primarily support MPEG-4, including H.264/AVC  
video and AAC audio. We may support other codecs as well - it won't  
necessarily be the full set of codecs supported by QuickTime. This  
has been discussed to death already, but here are our basic reasons:

- MPEG-4 is an ISO open standard (although unfortunately patent- 
encumbered).
- Ogg Theora/Vorbis offers a royalty-free license for the few known  
patents, but we would assume additional risk of submarine patents if  
we supported it.
- H.264 offers considerably better quality at the same bitrate than  
Theora/Vorbis.
- H.264 is better for video delivery to limited-capability and low- 
power devices that support hardware video decoding. You may have  
heard that YouTube will be serving their video content as H.264 to  
AppleTV and iPhone.

That's our current plan. We may revise it in light of future events,  
but it is unlikely that even a MUST-level requirement in the HTML  
spec would have much effect on whether we support Ogg or not.

Regards,
Maciej
