</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Three cheers for Apple for trying to tackle some of the

</I>
Many thanks for all your helpful comments!

&gt;<i>Without trying to assess whether CSS media queries are the best 
</I>&gt;<i>approach generally, here's three particular issues I wanted to raise:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. Property values
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I honestly don't think the property values are well-named. &quot;either&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i>is confusing and vague; &quot;dont-want&quot; is a misspelled colloquialism.
</I>


We struggled with this also;  suggestions are welcome.

&gt;<i>How about one of the following possibilities:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>captions: wanted
</I>&gt;<i>captions: unwanted
</I>&gt;<i>captions: no-preference
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(This seems more natural to me than the original proposal.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>/or/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>captions: prefer
</I>&gt;<i>captions: prefer-not
</I>&gt;<i>captions: no-preference
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(Has the consistency of using the same word as the basis for each 
</I>&gt;<i>value. OTOH &quot;prefer-not&quot; and &quot;no-preference&quot; may be confusing if 
</I>&gt;<i>your English isn't that good.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>/or/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>captions: desired
</I>&gt;<i>captions: undesired
</I>&gt;<i>captions: no-preference
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(&quot;desire&quot; has the minor advantages of being in Ogden's basic English 
</I>&gt;<i>word list and being common to Romance languages thanks to a Latin 
</I>&gt;<i>root. OTOH it's slightly longer.)
</I>
nice (in my personal opinion).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2. Conflict resolution
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The proposal does not describe how conflicts such as the following 
</I>&gt;<i>would be resolved:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>User specifies:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>captions: want
</I>&gt;<i>high-contrast-video: want
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Author codes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;video ... &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;source media=&quot;all and (captions: want;high-contrast-video: 
</I>&gt;<i>dont-want)&quot; ... /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;source media=&quot;all and (captions: dont-want;high-contrast-video: 
</I>&gt;<i>want)&quot; ... /&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;/video&gt;
</I>
There is no suitable source here;  it's best to have something (late) 
in the list which is less restrictive.

&gt;<i>Because style rules cascade, this sort of conflict doesn't matter 
</I>&gt;<i>when media queries are applied to styles. But you can only view one 
</I>&gt;<i>video source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3. (Even more) special requirements
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The suggested list of media features is (self-confessedly) not 
</I>&gt;<i>exhaustive. Here's some things that seem to be missing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>a) I should think sign-language interpretation needs to be in there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>sign-interpretation: want | dont-want | either (default: want)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Unless we want to treat sign interpretation as a special form of 
</I>&gt;<i>subtitling. How is subtitling in various languages to be handled?
</I>
I think we assume that a language attribute can also be specified, as today.

I have to confess I saw the BBC story about sign-language soon after 
sending this round internally.  But I need to do some study on the 
naming of sign languages and whether they have ISO codes.  Is it true 
that if I say that the human language is ISO 639-2 code XXX, and that 
it's signed, there is only one choice for what the sign language is 
(I don't think so -- isn't american sign language different from 
british)?  Alternatively, are there ISO or IETF codes for sign 
languages themselves?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>b) Would full descriptive transcriptions (e.g. for the deafblind) 
</I>&gt;<i>fit into this media feature-based scheme or not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>transcription: want | dont-want | either (default: either)
</I>
how are these presented to a deafblind user?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>c) How about screening out visual content dangerous to those with 
</I>&gt;<i>photosensitive epilepsy, an problem that has just made headlines in 
</I>&gt;<i>the UK:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6724245.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6724245.stm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Perhaps:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>max-flashes-per-second: &lt;integer&gt; | any (default: 3)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Where the UA must not show visual content if the user is selecting 
</I>&gt;<i>for a lower number of flashes per second. By default UAs should be 
</I>&gt;<i>configured not to display content which breaches safety levels; the 
</I>&gt;<i>default value should be 3 /not/ any.
</I>
I think we'd prefer not to get into quantitative measures here, but a 
boolean &quot;this program is unsuitable for those prone to epilepsy 
induced by flashing lights&quot; might make sense.  epilepsy: dont-want -:)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Compare:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20070517/Overview.html#G19">http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20070517/Overview.html#G19</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>d) Facilitating people with cognitive disabilities within a media 
</I>&gt;<i>query framework is trickier. Some might prefer content which has 
</I>&gt;<i>been stripped down to simple essentials. Some might prefer content 
</I>&gt;<i>which has extra explanations. Some might benefit from a media query 
</I>&gt;<i>based on reading level. Compare the discussion of assessing 
</I>&gt;<i>readability levels at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://juicystudio.com/services/readability.php">http://juicystudio.com/services/readability.php</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>reading-level: &lt;integer&gt; | basic | average | complex | any (default: any)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Where the integer would be how many years of schooling it would take 
</I>&gt;<i>an average person to understand the content: basic could be (say) 9, 
</I>&gt;<i>average could be 12, and complex could be 17 (post-graduate).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This wouldn't be easily testable, but it might be useful nevertheless.
</I>
Yes, this isn't testable, and is quantitative.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Postscript: This isn't an accessibility issue but /if/ media queries 
</I>&gt;<i>are adopted as a mechanism for serving up the best content for a 
</I>&gt;<i>person's abilities, I wonder if they could also be used to enhance 
</I>&gt;<i>parental control systems using queries based on PICS:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/PICS/">http://www.w3.org/PICS/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So for example, one &lt;source&gt; might have a music video featuring 
</I>&gt;<i>uncensored swearing, and another &lt;source&gt; might have the same video 
</I>&gt;<i>with the swearing beeped out.
