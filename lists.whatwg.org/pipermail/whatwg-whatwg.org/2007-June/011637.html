It also defines the names of events, their associated IDL interfaces,  
whether they bubble, whether they are cancellable, and so forth.  
Admittedly it does not give useful formal conformance criteria for  
when to dispatch most of events.

DOM 3 Events defines this for the &quot;load&quot; event for instance. It seems  
to me that &quot;load&quot; and &quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot; can both be defined in ways  
that are independent of the specific markup language, and are equally  
deserving of being in DOM 3 Events itself. Certainly in a user agent  
that supports multiple markup languages, you'd want DOMContentLoaded  
to be dispatched for all of them under the same conditions.

Finally, the reason it was left out in the first place was largely  
due to presumed lack of use cases, not because it was believed to  
require language-specific processing rules. And that argument was  
accepted largely due to your support for it. So it would be good to  
at least present the new info.

Regards,
Maciej
