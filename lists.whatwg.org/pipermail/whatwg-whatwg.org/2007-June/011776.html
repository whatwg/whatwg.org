I don't really see why. Seems like an additional level of indirection.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've come to the conclusion that you need pictures to accompany the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;adoption agency algorithm&quot;.  However, I'm not an artist.  Indeed, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm so bad at drawing pictures, that in the past, users often sent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; me replacement bitmap graphics for my programs because they found my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; attempts so distressing :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, I completely agree. Diagrams and examples. If someone wants to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do a diagram here I'd be most happy. Failing that, I'll probably get 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around to it in due course (e.g. once I'm convinced it actually 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is the most complex part of the tree construction.  Perhaps in lieu 
</I>&gt;<i> of pictures in the short term, a short non-normative summary could be 
</I>&gt;<i> added describing what the algorithm is doing, because reverse 
</I>&gt;<i> engineering it from the 14-step plan is hard.
</I>
As I said, if someone wants to contribute examples, introduction 
materials, diagrams, or other helping material, I'm certainly open to 
adding it to the spec. I just don't want to do it myself until I'm 
confident the spec is stable.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The &quot;parsing quirks&quot; box lists several issues that I think are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; important. The &lt;script&gt; one in particular is so very common. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I had to cave in eventually and support that because 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it broke some customers' own sites.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you describe what exactly the quirk is? I have yet to see an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; algorithmic description of how to parse &lt;script&gt; blocks in quirks 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mode. In my research and the research that other people have done, it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was found that every UA does it slightly differently. This is why I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really rather not do this.  If you can tell me exactly what it is, I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might be more convinced to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's hard to pin down.  In effect, it's a new value for the content 
</I>&gt;<i> model flag which is like some sort of combination of RCDATA and 
</I>&gt;<i> PLAINTEXT. I'm not sure it's just a quirk, to be honest.  I've tried the 
</I>&gt;<i> following snippet in Firefox, Opera &amp; IE6 and they behave the same way 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of the presence of a strict HTML4 doctype declaration before 
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;html&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;html&gt;&lt;title&gt;The &lt;!-- comment with a &lt;/title&gt; in the --&gt; title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;body
</I>&gt;<i> onload=&quot;document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(document.title))&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In all cases, the window title and the text shown in the document body was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The &lt;!-- comment with a &lt;/title&gt; in the --&gt; title
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same behaviour appears to apply to TEXTAREA, SCRIPT, NOSCRIPT, 
</I>&gt;<i> NOFRAMES, NOEMBED.  STYLE works differently in Firefox (it thinks that 
</I>&gt;<i> the content property's value terminates the style tag:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;style&gt; &lt;!-- h1:after { content: '&lt;/style&gt;'; color: red } --&gt; &lt;/style&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The rule seems to be that whilst you are lexing the contents of one of 
</I>&gt;<i> these magical elements, you have an additional flag, initialised to 
</I>&gt;<i> false, that indicates that you are inside an pseudo-comment.  You 
</I>&gt;<i> continue to accumulate character tokens, but if you see the sequence 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;!-- and the flag is false, you set the flag to true.  If the flag is 
</I>&gt;<i> true and you see the sequence --&gt;, you set the flag to false.  Whilst 
</I>&gt;<i> the flag is true, finding the &lt; does not switch to the open tag state.  
</I>&gt;<i> The character tokens are all accumulated into the content of the 
</I>&gt;<i> element, regardless of whether they match the &lt;!-- or --&gt; markers.
</I>
It does indeed seem that CDATA and RCDATA have this behaviour in the 
tokeniser in IE. Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Finally (for now ;-), right at the beginning of the tree 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; construction section, it says that DOM Mutation events must not fire 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for changes caused by the UA parsing the document.  I cannot decide 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; whether or not I agree with that statement.  My experimentation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; appears to show that this is indeed what happens in Firefox, at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; least. I put a script in the head of my document that attaches a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; listener for DOMNodeInserted on the document.documentElement node 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (i.e. the HTML element) and it never gets called due to nodes being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; added by the parser.  Internally, for me, it's a PITA though, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; because my node tree construction code and DOM implementation code 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; use the same internal APIs - and these automatically trigger the DOM 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; events, which, in turn, get dispatched to the various internal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; default event handlers to deal with the special types of node that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; require additional behaviour (like IMG, LINK, META etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In Web browsers it's simply not an option. Having to fire mutation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; events for every mutation according to the complete DOM3 Events model 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is prohibitively expensive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I've not found it a burden even on the sorts of low-end 
</I>&gt;<i> devices that our software runs (typically 300MHz CPUs, 8MB RAM, that 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of thing)  Then again, I have a highly optimised event dispatcher 
</I>&gt;<i> that takes steps to minimise the work, particularly when there are no 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM listeners for the event being raised, which will almost always be 
</I>&gt;<i> the case for the events concerned (DOMNodeInserted and 
</I>&gt;<i> DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument and the Removed counterparts).  The internal 
</I>&gt;<i> default event handlers have similar filtering to eliminate any 
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary processing quickly.
</I>
Even minimal work is more than no work, and when you're dealing with 
thousands of elements, that's a big difference (in the order of 
milliseconds).


&gt;<i> In the &quot;in body&quot; section, WBR doesn't really belong with a,b,big,em... 
</I>&gt;<i> because it never had content.  It probably ought to go in with 
</I>&gt;<i> area,basefont,bgsound... a bit further down, or in its own section.  
</I>&gt;<i> There's no real point bothering with putting it in the list of active 
</I>&gt;<i> formatting elements so it's coming off the stack again straight away.
</I>
Fixed.
