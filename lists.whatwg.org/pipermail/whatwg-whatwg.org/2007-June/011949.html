Done.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think it would be beneficial to additionally stipulate that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1. The meta element-based character encoding information declaration 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is expected to work only if the Basic Latin range of characters maps

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this realistic? I'm not really familiar enough with character 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encodings to say if this is what happens in general.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose it is realistic. See below.
</I>
That was already there, turns out.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. If there is no external character encoding information nor a BOM 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (see below), there MUST NOT be any non-ASCII bytes in the document 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; byte stream before the end of the meta element that declares the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; character encoding. (In practice this would ban unescaped non-ASCII 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; class names on the html and [head] elements and non-ASCII comments 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; at the beginning of the document.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, can we realistically require this? I need to do some studies of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-latin pages, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As UA behavior, no. As a conformance requirement, maybe.
</I>
I don't think we should require this, given the preparse step. I can if 
people think we should, though.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Authors should avoid including inline character encoding 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; information. Character encoding information should instead be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; included at the transport level (e.g. using the HTTP Content-Type 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; header).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I disagree.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; With HTML with contemporary UAs, there is no real harm in including 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the character encoding information both on the HTTP level and in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; meta as long as the information is not contradictory. On the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; contrary, the author-provided internal information is actually 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; useful when end users save pages to disk using UAs that do not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reserialize with internal character encoding information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...and it breaks everything when you have a transcoding proxy, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, not until you save to disk, since HTTP takes precedence. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> authors can escape this by using UTF-8. (Assuming here that tampering 
</I>&gt;<i> with UTF-8 would be harmful, wrong and pointless.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interestingly, transcoding proxies tend to be brought up by residents of 
</I>&gt;<i> Western Europe, North America or the Commonwealth. I have never seen a 
</I>&gt;<i> Russion person living in Russia or a Japanese person living in Japan 
</I>&gt;<i> talk about transcoding proxies in any online or offline discussion. 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I doubt the importance of transcoding proxies.
</I>
I think this discouragement has been removed now. Let me know if it lives 
on somewhere.


&gt;<i> &gt; Character encoding information shouldn't be duplicated, IMHO, that's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just asking for trouble.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest a mismatch be considered an easy parse error and, therefore, 
</I>&gt;<i> reportable.
</I>
I believe this is required in the spec.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; For HTML, user agents must use the following algorithm in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; determining the character encoding of a document:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. If the transport layer specifies an encoding, use that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Shouldn't there be a BOM-sniffing step here? (UTF-16 and UTF-8 only; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; UTF-32 makes no practical sense for interchange on the Web.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know, should there?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there should.
</I>
There's a BOM step in the spec; let me know if you think it's in the wrong 
place.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Otherwise, if the user agent can find a meta element that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; specifies character encoding information (as described above), 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; then use that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If a conformance checker has not determined the character encoding 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; by now, what should it do? Should it report the document as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; non-conforming (my preferred choice)? Should it default to US-ASCII 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and report any non-ASCII bytes as conformance errors? Should it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; continue to the fuzzier steps like browsers would (hopefully not)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll continue to treat such documents as non-conforming, then.
</I>
I've made it non-conforming to not use ASCII if you've got no encoding 
information and no BOM.


&gt;<i> Notably, character encodings that I am aware of and [aren't 
</I>&gt;<i> ASCII-compatible] are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> JIS_X0212-1990, x-JIS0208, various legacy IBM codepages, x-MacDingbat 
</I>&gt;<i> and x-MacSymbol, UTF-7, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The x-MacDingbat and x-MacSymbol encodings are irrelevant to Web pages. 
</I>&gt;<i> After browsing the encoding menus of Firefox, Opera and Safari, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty confident that the legacy IBM codepages are irrelevant as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest the following algorithm as a starting point. It does not handle
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-7, CESU-8, JIS_X0212-1990 or x-JIS0208.
</I>
I've made those either MUST NOTs or SHOULD NOTs, amongst others.


&gt;<i> Set the REWIND flag to unraised.
</I>
The REWIND idea sadly doesn't work very well given that you can actually 
have things like javascript: URIs and event handlers that execute on 
content in the &lt;head&gt;, in pathological cases.

However, I did something similar in the spec as it stands now.


&gt;<i> Requirements I'd like to see:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Documents must specify a character encoding an must use an 
</I>&gt;<i> IANA-registered encoding and must identify it using its preferred MIME 
</I>&gt;<i> name or use a BOM (with UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32). UAs must recognize the 
</I>&gt;<i> preferred MIME name of every encoding they support that has a preferred 
</I>&gt;<i> MIME name. UAs should recognize IANA-registered aliases.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> Documents must not use UTF-EBCDIC, BOCU-1, CESU-8, UTF-7, UTF-16BE (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> BOMless), UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE or any encodings from the EBCDIC 
</I>&gt;<i> family of encodings. Documents using the UTF-16 or UTF-32 encodings must 
</I>&gt;<i> have a BOM.
</I>
Done except for UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE, though you might want to check 
that the spec says exactly what you want.


&gt;<i> UAs must support the UTF-8 encoding.
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> Encoding errors are easy parse errors. (Emit U+FFFD on bogus data.)
</I>
Encoding errors are covered by the encoding specs.


&gt;<i> Authors are adviced to use the UTF-8 encoding. Authors are adviced not 
</I>&gt;<i> to use the UTF-32 encoding or legacy encodings. (Note: I think UTF-32 on 
</I>&gt;<i> the Web is harmful and utterly pointless, but Firefox and Opera support 
</I>&gt;<i> it. Also, I'd like to have some text in the spec that justifies whining 
</I>&gt;<i> about legacy encodings. On the XML side, I give warnings if the encoding 
</I>&gt;<i> is not UTF-8, UTF-16, US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1. I also warn about aliases 
</I>&gt;<i> and potential trouble with RFC 3023 rules. However, I have no spec 
</I>&gt;<i> backing for treating dangerous RFC 3023 stuff as errors.)
</I>
Done, except about the RFC3023 stuff. Could you elaborate on that? I don't 
really have anything about encodings and XML in the spec.


&gt;<i> Also, the spec should probably give guidance on what encodings need to 
</I>&gt;<i> be supported. That set should include at least UTF-8, US-ASCII, 
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252. It should probably not be larger than the 
</I>&gt;<i> intersection of the sets of encodings supported by Firefox, Opera, 
</I>&gt;<i> Safari and IE6. (It might even be useful to intersect that set with the 
</I>&gt;<i> encodings supported by JDK and Python by default.)
</I>
Made it just UTF-8 and Win1252.

Indeed. (The HTML5 spec says the above.)

Required, always.

That isn't what the spec says, but I have other outstanding comments on

Does the current text (which doesn't mention forms) satisfy you?

BOCU-1 has been used for security attacks. It's on the &quot;no fly&quot; list.

If you know the encoding before going in (e.g. it's in Content-Type 
metadata) then if the BOM is correctly encoded you just ignore it, and if 
it's incorrectly encoded then you won't see it as a BOM and you'll 
probably treat it as U+FFFD. From an authoring standpoint, especially 
given that tools now tend to output BOMs silently (e.g. Notepad), and 
*especially* considering that a BOM is invisible, it would just be a pain 
to have to take out the first character in certain cases. No?
