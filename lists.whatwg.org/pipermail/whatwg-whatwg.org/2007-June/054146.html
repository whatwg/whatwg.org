Right now the two groups are using exactly the same spec, byte-for-byte, 
just with a different header.


&gt;<i> Even if DTDs are non-normative and antiquated in the HTML 5 spec, it at 
</I>&gt;<i> least provides some method for authors to indicate their intentions.  
</I>&gt;<i> If my intention was to write a document conforming to HTML 3.2, I can 
</I>&gt;<i> use the HTML 3.2 DTD to tell anyone in the future that I was using a 
</I>&gt;<i> certain set of elements.
</I>
Wouldn't simply the act of using those elements be enough to say which 
elements you used?


&gt;<i> If browsers pay no attention to DTDs, as WHATWG has said time and again, 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers must be rendering &quot;the latest and greatest&quot; markup.  If in 50 
</I>&gt;<i> years, the &quot;i&quot; element has been out of use for 40 years, and browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> stop rendering that element and validators throw errors on that element, 
</I>&gt;<i> the document still conforms to the DTD.  It's not the author's fault 
</I>&gt;<i> that the document doesn't perform the way it intended.  Ideally, the 
</I>&gt;<i> browser should care about DTDs.
</I>
If you're arguing that browsers in 50 years should have two modes, one 
with the obsolete &lt;i&gt; element not supported, and one with the obsolete &lt;i&gt; 
element supported (to support old content), why wouldn't it be better to 
simply have one rendering mode, which supported &lt;i&gt;?


&gt;<i> The WHATWG HTML 5 spec provides no way to specify what version / fork of 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML the author intended to use.  Even if browsers don't pay attention, 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is a shame that there is no way to specify (if for nothing 
</I>&gt;<i> else, to future-proof documents).  I blogged about this in more detail. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://robertdot.org/2007/03/08/html-5-whatwg-versus-w3c.html">http://robertdot.org/2007/03/08/html-5-whatwg-versus-w3c.html</A>
</I>
I don't understand why it matters what version you're using. Or, for that 
matter, how most authors are supposed to work out which version they're 
using.


&gt;<i> It seems the WHATWG is staunchly against DTDs, even if it has an 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate use (e.g. emails in this thread talking about XML entities).
</I>
It's perfectly possible to use DTDs and entities when using XML with 
XHTML5. Nothing in the spec prevents that. (Browsers somewhat prevent it, 
since they don't fetch DTDs, though.)


&gt;<i> I've mulled over this awhile.  Since DTDs aren't normative in browsers, 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a &quot;link&quot; element with a &quot;rel=specification&quot; and an 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;href=<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/</A>&quot; (for example) 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a new way to say, &quot;this is the specification I used to create 
</I>&gt;<i> this document.&quot;  It is easier to remember than the DOCTYPE DTDs on 
</I>&gt;<i> pervious versions of HTML, and it is much more human-readable than DTDs.  
</I>&gt;<i> It addresses my concerns, and doesn't use DTDs.
</I>
Why does it matter which spec you used?
