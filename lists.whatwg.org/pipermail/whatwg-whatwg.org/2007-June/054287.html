<PRE>

Of course you are right; I was thinking of the tr&#233;ma when I wrote that and I
changed it to a dieresis afterwards to make it more English (to get rid of
the red underlines).  A general qui pro quo followed.
Slovak &#228; is an original invention; the tr&#233;ma palatalizes the preceding
consonant.  I did not consider capharna&#252;m invalid but irrelevant: it is a
Hebrew (or Aramaic?) proper name and can be regarded as a transcription.
Thanks
Chris

As you may know, diaresis derives from the Greek verb ???????? (diairein),
which means &quot;to divide&quot;, and it does indeed have an intrinsic meaning.

According to the OED, a diaresis is &quot;[t]he sign (&#168;) marking [a phonological
diaresis], or,
more usually, placed over the second of two vowels which otherwise make a
diphthong or single sound, to indicate that they are to be pronounced
separately.&quot;

Similarly, umlaut is defined as &quot;[t]he diacritical sign (&#168;) placed over a
vowel to
indicate that [umlaut] has taken place.&quot;

Hence, the use of either term when the double-dot diacritic is performing
another linguistic function is equally abusive.

&gt;<i> the phonetic meaning of umlaut is generic and well-defined by its
</I>&gt;<i> very name and it does not apply to the vowel I.
</I>
Indeed. German umlaut notation is further restricted, and I am not quite
sure
if the phonetic phenomenon applies to y either, but this is rather far off
topic.

&gt;<i> I did not intend to make HTML support all possible linguistic intricacies;
</I>&gt;<i> I only wanted to eliminate the common nonsense of denoting i with &iuml;
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>  I only want the true umlaut to be distinct, not as a code point but as an
</I>entity name.
&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> It would be up to the author to determine whether &uuml; or &utrema;
</I>&gt;<i> is appropriate; both entities should denote the same character.
</I>
Do you really think it is a good idea to introduce twelve new aliases
that do not work in current browsers, do not make the language more
expressive and require authors to make meaningless decisions?
(Is Slovak &#228; borrowed from German [it is pronounced a or ?] and
therefore &auml; or does it have another origin? Should we use
&atrema; by default? How about Pinyin &#252;? Swedish words that contain
an &#246; as a result of umlaut vs those that contain it for a different reason?)

Trema or diaresis might have been a better choice than umlaut as a generic
name,
since umlaut does not apply to all Latin vowels, but it is really too late
to fix this now.

The canonical example in Dutch seems to be co&#246;rdinatie, see
<A HREF="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trema_in_de_Nederlandse_spelling">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trema_in_de_Nederlandse_spelling</A> .

&gt;<i> Something along the lines of zo&#246;logy, but actually required?
</I>
Well, such spellings are &quot;actually required&quot; in some varieties of English.
&quot;The New Yorker mandates that authors must co&#246;perate to re&#235;ducate our
readership.&quot; - allegedly from the magazine's style manual.

I have no idea why you consider capharna&#252;m to be invalid (if this is what
you imply),
but perhaps Spanish ping&#252;ino and Dutch re&#252;nie will be more convincing
examples.
