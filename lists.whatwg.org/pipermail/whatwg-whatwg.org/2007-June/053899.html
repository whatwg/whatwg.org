I have removed the dependency. You can now specify &quot;defer&quot; even without 
the &quot;src&quot; attribute.

I've also removed the restriction for &quot;async&quot;, because you might want to 
run a set of scripts in a particular order, with one of them being 
external and async, and another being internal. The only way to guarentee 
the internal one runs immediately after the external one is to make the 
internal one async too.

This doesn't preclude us allowing the other.

It might not be better, but that's not a reason to disallow it.

HTML5 defines it exactly.

HTML5 defines this more exactly than HTML4.
