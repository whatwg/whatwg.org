<PRE>&gt;<i> When the tokenization state machine is defined, every state first
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consumes&quot; and then potentially &quot;emits&quot;. Some of the states transfer to
</I>&gt;<i> another state with an order to &quot;re-consume the character in the next
</I>&gt;<i> state&quot;. This means that what you do in the new state is dependant on
</I>&gt;<i> what you did in the last state and that the &quot;comsume&quot; is necessarily an
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent operation. A much better wording would be &quot;look at the next
</I>&gt;<i> character&quot; and on state transition &quot;consume and emit&quot; or just &quot;emit
</I>&gt;<i> without consumption&quot; making it clear when the input cursor moves.
</I>
I did the same in Twintsam with PeekChar/PeekChars and EatChar/EatChars methods.
<A HREF="http://twintsam.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Twintsam/Html/HtmlReader.StreamHandling.cs">http://twintsam.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Twintsam/Html/HtmlReader.StreamHandling.cs</A>
(beware, Twintsam hasn't been updated since January so it's not in
sync with the spec as it is now)

though actually you could just use a character queue into which you
push back characters that needs to be &quot;re-consumed&quot; (i.e. you
&quot;un-read&quot; the character and then you switch to the other state).
This is what html5lib does:
<A HREF="http://html5lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/src/tokenizer.py">http://html5lib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/src/tokenizer.py</A>
(search for self.stream.queue; this needs to be refactored with an
unread() method on the HTMLInputStream)

That is to say, I don't think the spec should be changed at all. It's
just a matter of how you implement it. You just have to know that the
&quot;queue&quot; won't ever be larger than 9 characters as there are tweaks for
0-prefixed numeric entities and/or numeric entities greater 1114111.

&gt;<i> It would be nice if all &lt;!...&gt; tags (except comments) were considered
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;declarations&quot; instead of bogus comments. Then DOCTYPE wouldn't need
</I>&gt;<i> special handling by the tokenizer, just special handling by the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> (Too much of the parser seems to have gotten into the tokenizer; with
</I>&gt;<i> CDATA and RCDATA, this is a necessary evil. With &lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt; it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't.)
</I>
I can't see the problem here; plus DOCTYPE parsing is special because
we need the DOCTYPE name.
Moreover, the spec has changed recently so that DOCTYPE parsing takes
care of PUBLIC and SYSTEM identifiers.
