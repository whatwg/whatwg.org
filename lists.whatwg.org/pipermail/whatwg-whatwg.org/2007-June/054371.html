My Google apps currently use mail.google.com, docs.google.com,
picasaweb.google.com ... Calendar uses www.google.com, I don't know why :-)
So most of these apps have their own domains, and won't face a problem here.
Is it overly burdensome to put separate apps in their own domains?

If it is, then I would suggest simply allowing consistency to be partitioned
by directory as well. I'm not sure of the best way for the server to
configure that, though.

In fact while we want to make sure the user has the most up to date version
&gt;<i> we don't need to check on every use. In most cases the current captured

</I>&gt;<i> the server needs to tell the client application that it has to force an

Yep.
