This was fixed recently.

</I>&gt;<i> the parsing section is changed.
</I>
Oops, forgot to fix that last time. Fixed now.

HTML5 requires this now.

Indeed.

That seems a bit specious given that for type=file you'd have to ignore 
value=&quot;&quot; anyway. Furthermore, making the &quot;&lt;&quot; be _not_ part of the tag name 
is what causes the security issue, as it's only when you _don't_ put it in 
the tag name that you end up with an &lt;input&gt; element.

Anyway, that's the advantage of having a single, well-defined tokeniser, 
you don't have to worry about differences in opinion. :-)


&gt;<i> It also seems like a bad idea to allow a document to be parsed such as 
</I>&gt;<i> there is no way to serialize it without creating an invalid html5 
</I>&gt;<i> serialization.
</I>
We are well past that point. Example:

   &lt;p bogus=&quot;&quot;&gt;

...can be parsed but can't be serialised legally.


&gt;<i> As far as element names go, i don't really see a reason to allow more, 
</I>&gt;<i> or less, characters than the XML spec lets you use.
</I>
The main reason is that you have to define what happens to the characters 
you don't allow. We don't have the option of fatal failure.
