<PRE>Hi Jerason,

I think there may be a lack of information about Theora rather than
anything else.

On 6/27/07, Jerason Banes &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">jbanes at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> If I may, I'd like to echo Timeless's point here. I've been watching this

</I>
It is not true that Theora is not used today. Wikipedia allows it as
the only video codec to publish content in on their site. Archive.org
support it as a format. And just about all video published by
Linux-related conferences is now published in Ogg Theora. Even some
social video hosting sites support it now.

I agree however that it is early days and that there is a lot of
education to be done around Ogg Theora.

&gt;<i> And can you blame web users? Theora provides a solution that's high
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth and low quality.
</I>
What makes you say that? Ogg Theora is comparable to MPEG-2, WMV,
RelPlayer and many other proprietary codecs - the only codec really
outperforming it is H.264.

&gt;<i> If and when the Dirac codec is completed, there will be a viable alternative
</I>&gt;<i> to the non-free video codec problem that might justify the risk/reward
</I>&gt;<i> equation for support.
</I>
Yes, Dirac is comparable in quality to H.264, but just hasn't got the
tool support yet that Ogg Theora has. If we are standardising for a
few years down the track, we should indeed consider Ogg Dirac/Vorbis
as an alternative.


Regards,
Silvia.
