It does if we say it does.

Why would we do this? I don't really want to add a lot of new attributes 
to &lt;option&gt;; it would overload &lt;option&gt; and that element is already having 
plenty enough fun with &lt;select&gt;, &lt;optgroup&gt;, &lt;datalist&gt;, form submission, 
&quot;am i control or am i not&quot; schizophrenia, etc.


&gt;<i> We can just use &lt;option&gt; elements instead of &lt;command&gt; when we need to 
</I>&gt;<i> hide menus. If we're going to support &lt;select&gt; elements as menu fallback 
</I>&gt;<i> markup, &lt;menu&gt; will have to support &lt;option&gt; elements anyways. This 
</I>&gt;<i> frees up &lt;command&gt; to be used specifically in the &lt;head&gt;.
</I>
I don't see any reason why &lt;command&gt; can't be used in the head anyway.

Basically I think the way that &lt;menu&gt; will have to support &lt;option&gt; is 
separate and distinct from the way that it will have to support other 
commands. I don't expect &lt;option&gt; to support everything that &lt;command&gt; 
might. Do you disagree?


&gt;<i> Sort of. I'm leaning towards having all elements but &lt;option&gt; nested
</I>&gt;<i> in an &lt;li&gt; element, though.
</I>
Yeah, I'm just worried that people are going to want more flexible 
fallback than a bulleted list though (notwithstanding the fact that you 
can use CSS to change the presentation).


&gt;<i> It just seems to have better semantics, and it also allows you to use 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple elements to build a menu item, like having an &lt;img&gt;, a &lt;input 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt; and a &lt;label&gt; in the same &lt;li&gt; to create a menu item 
</I>&gt;<i> with a checkbox and an icon.
</I>
Oh I certainly agree that we want to allow &lt;li&gt;.


&gt;<i> &gt; Not quite sure how to get the label for nested &lt;menu&gt; elements yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fail to see what's wrong with using the activation of &lt;menulabel&gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> display menus.
</I>
I dunno, it's just ugly. I wasn't really happy with it when I first put it 
in the spec and the more I look at it the less I like it. (See also 
earlier mail about this.)


&gt;<i> Part of the benefit of [menulabel] is the ability to call menus that are 
</I>&gt;<i> outside the &lt;menubar&gt;:
</I>
Yes, we want to keep that functionality. There might be neater ways to do 
this than &lt;menulabel for=&quot;&quot;&gt;, though. Maybe even &lt;menu def=&quot;&quot;/&gt; or 
something.


&gt;<i> For toolbars, something similar to &lt;menubar&gt; that takes &lt;button&gt; or 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;menulabel&gt; children seems in order. I prefer doing this as opposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;menu type=&quot;menutype&quot;&gt;, especially since &lt;input type=&quot;[type]&quot;&gt; has 
</I>&gt;<i> receive some resistance.
</I>
So the main problem with &lt;input type=&quot;&quot;&gt; is that one element is used for 
things that need to be implemented in fundamentally different ways.

The proposal with &lt;menu&gt; is not as bad. Specifically, we have these cases:

 * &lt;menu&gt; is dumb (can just be styled by CSS).

 * &lt;menu&gt; is hidden.

 * &lt;menu&gt; is replaced by a toolbar.

In addition, any &lt;menu&gt; can be used to generate a native menu. This isn't 
something relevant to &lt;menu&gt; itself, though -- much like the fact that you 
can generate an outline from &lt;h1&gt;s, etc, is not really that relevant to 
the &lt;h1&gt; elements themselves.


&gt;<i> It also creates specific elements they have to support rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute values, which makes it harder for vendors to falsely claim 
</I>&gt;<i> support.
</I>
The solution to that problem is test suites, not compromises in language 
design, IMHO.


&gt;<i> I think it also increases visibility.
</I>
Not sure what you mean here.


&gt;<i> Thought: Is the distinction between a menubar and a toolbar entirely 
</I>&gt;<i> presentational? Use one element? &lt;commandbar&gt;?
</I>
I don't think there is any difference at all between &lt;menubar&gt; and 
&lt;toolbar&gt;, really, hence wanting to just use &lt;menu&gt;.


&gt;<i> Not sure I like the whole thing about the user agent guessing it's a 
</I>&gt;<i> menu based on if it has a label or is connected to a context menu 
</I>&gt;<i> reference. Might just be able to fix that by requiring the |label| 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute. Then again, it seems like it's doing what could be done with 
</I>&gt;<i> the |title| attribute.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> Perhaps an attribute |type| with the possible values &quot;menu&quot; and &quot;list&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> where &quot;list&quot; is the default.
</I>
Yeah.


&gt;<i> Then again, toolbars often have separators, so maybe they're a type of 
</I>&gt;<i> list anyways and require &lt;li&gt;-type markup, thus making &lt;menu type&gt; more 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate. Hmm...
</I>
&lt;hr&gt; is our separator element. Not sure what it stands for exactly. &quot;Here 
is a separatoR&quot;, maybe. *cough*


&gt;<i> Above, the type &quot;menu&quot; is assumed to be a sort of context menu activated 
</I>&gt;<i> either by a true context menu feature or by a &lt;menulabel&gt;. Then again, 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;commandbar&gt;-type elements are flat, and while they may have 
</I>&gt;<i> groupings/separators (for toolbars, at least), they don't have 
</I>&gt;<i> multilevel groupings.
</I>
They kind of do, in some contexts, e.g. drop-down buttons.
