</I>
All right, I missed this bit.

I'll comment on the file upload stuff later, in the meantime:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> http: - &quot;put&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; are little-used methods on the web.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Well, yeah, since there's basically no way to use them. This is  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> partly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> intended to address this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In theory you could use them through XMLHttpRequest, if that were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified as allowed I think it would be more useful than allowing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as form submission methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's specified as allowed already.
</I>
So you think they should be left in? It wouldn't be an unreasonable  
burden to implement these so I'm willing to withdraw my objection if  
no one else things it is a problem.

&gt;<i> It would be so cool to be able to implement an FTP client with just a
</I>&gt;<i> simple HTML form. But ok. I've made them all act as GET.
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> data: - all the methods except &quot;get&quot; seem weird and of questionable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> usefulness. The things you can do through trivial text substitution
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are extremely limited and are better handled by script IMO.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So what should happen instead?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once again, treat as unknown method, i.e. like &quot;get&quot;. I think  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mistaken desire to want to fill every box in the 3-D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol/format/method grid, but it seems more reasonable to me to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> treat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> method as specific to protocol and for now only applicable to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> http, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essentially ignore method for the other protocols.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough for the other protocols, but in the case of data:, it  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> actually be really useful from a debugging persective to be able to  
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> ahold of the form submission data. Given how easy the definition  
</I>&gt;<i> for data:
</I>&gt;<i> is to implement, do you still object to it?
</I>
No strong objection, although the usefulness of this behavior seems  
limited and it would have to be a special case in the code.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Untrusted content&quot; is unclear. It implies the existence of something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that isn't &quot;untrusted content&quot;, i.e. &quot;trusted content&quot;. Where is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined? I do not believe it is defined anywhere, in which case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specifying its behavior seems non-useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have rephrased this sentence.
</I>
I think this section is still somewhat problematic because a  
reasonable behavior is to allow &quot;get&quot; posts to &quot;file:&quot; URLs from a  
local file document that is not marked trusted in any special way, as  
such a document can already do normal &quot;file:&quot; URL loads anyway  
through other mechanisms. And this is much less risky than allowing  
execution of prgrams or writing/deleting of files.

However, ignoring the method in this case would put UAs in conflict  
with this non-normative section, so at minimum it seems they would  
have to change to disallow &quot;post&quot;, &quot;put&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; entirely or be  
in conflict with this section. I'm not even sure if considering some  
content only &quot;trusted&quot; enough for one of the four columns would  
satisfy this section.

But this does not seem like a very serious problem, now that the  
section is non-normative.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mailto: - &quot;post&quot;/&quot;put&quot;/&quot;delete&quot; behavior seems useless, since  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the form
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can control the body but not the headers (or at least the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> headers can't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> come from form elements in any obvious way). It seems like in  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most cases
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you'd want the body text to be composed text in any case -  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> popping up a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> message window full of form submission date does not seem useful. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> recommend just removing everything but &quot;get&quot; for now, since the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feature
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> freeze means it is too late to redesign this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once again I would omit this and treat like &quot;get&quot;. I think being  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specify the message body is a handy feature for &quot;mailto:&quot; submission.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But this is already offered via the &quot;get&quot; method, see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc2368.txt">http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc2368.txt</A> and search for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;body&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So &quot;post&quot; is not adding any new capabilities and therefore I think  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec should omit this extension and treat it as an unknown method,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same as &quot;get&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, the current descriptions of POST and GET match what UAs  
</I>&gt;<i> do, in
</I>&gt;<i> my limited testing. (I've changed PUT and DELETE to say they should  
</I>&gt;<i> match
</I>&gt;<i> GET instead of POST, though.) The upload part is new, of course.
</I>
I stand corrected. This seems fine.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do not think it is right for the spec to call for undefined
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> behavior. The right way to leave behavior undefined is to not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specify it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think it's much better to explicitly state when behaviour is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> undefined rather than leave the reader in the dark, but that's  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> another
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> story.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, submission behavior is also unspecified for &quot;gopher:&quot;, &quot;sip:&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;nfs:&quot;, and so forth. I do not think it is the spec's job to list  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> URI scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, but it's the spec's job to answer questions from implementors  
</I>&gt;<i> as to
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what they are supposed to do when the user submits a form to a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol they support. The protocols listed were those most likely  
</I>&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;<i> encountered.
</I>
Agreed, but this is difficult when the URI scheme is not properly  
defined yet.


&gt;&gt;<i> By my cursory testing, current UA behavior is to do nothing,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disallowing javascript: as a submit action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My testing suggested that what happened was what I described under  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;GET&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I've removed the POST method, and defaulted post/put/delete to get.  
</I>&gt;<i> It's a
</I>&gt;<i> pity, the mechanism I described for POST was quite cool.
</I>
I stand corrected, my test case has a typo. Indeed the behavior is as  
you state. I'm glad I specified &quot;cursory testing&quot;. :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, but if there is no actual PUT operation, then it seems like the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right treatment is as unknown action. Why should POST be handled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differently for mailto: than, say, HEAD? Or FOOBAR? All three are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> equally meaningless in this context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, in the mailto: case, POST and GET have always been treated
</I>&gt;<i> differently. I understand what you mean, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if the updated spec still has issues. I didn't change  
</I>&gt;<i> all the
</I>&gt;<i> things you raised, as noted above; let me know if you disagree with my
</I>&gt;<i> reasoning above and think I should change the spec more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#methodAndEnctypes">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#methodAndEnctypes</A>
</I>
I like most of the changes. I will review the revised file upload  
behavior and comment on that. I would also like to review the &quot;data:&quot;  
behavior in more detail to see if it seems appropriate. Other than  
that, I feel my concerns have been addressed, and I'll get back to  
you on the two points above.

Regards,
Maciej
