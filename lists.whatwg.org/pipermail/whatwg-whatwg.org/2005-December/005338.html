It isn't clear to me that it is either possible or desirable to 
standardise a navigation mechanism for Web pages.

That isn't to say that we'll be removing the possibility to annotate link 
relationships in HTML5 -- quite the opposite. But I don't see what we can 
do in the spec that would improve matters for the user. Current 
implementations of browser-hosted site navigation are terrible (and I say 
this as someone who has been heavily involved in their development over 
the years). Until this problem is solved, I don't see any point in 
requiring UAs to implement such a mechanism (especially since UAs would 
just ignore the requirement anyway, making a farce of the specification).
