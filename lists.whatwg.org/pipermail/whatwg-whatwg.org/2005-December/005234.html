<PRE>I wasn't actually suggesting &lt;li&gt; be merged with &lt;menu&gt;, just that your
definition of menu as &quot;A list of available options&quot; was too broad to be
the criteria for defining &lt;menu&gt;.


The feature of ribbon I was specifically thinking of was the way chunks
collapse when space isn't available. The ribbon is segmented into
smaller toolbars such as &quot;arrange&quot;. When the window is narrow and it
can't display all the chunks some of them collapse into a single menu. 

It doesn't make sense for a &lt;menubar&gt; to behave like a menu based on
available space but if everything is a &lt;menu&gt; it's logical.

More information on this aspect of ribbon here:

&lt;ul&gt; is an unordered list of items.
&lt;ol&gt; is an ordered list of items.
&lt;dl&gt; is an unordered list of name-value tuples.
&lt;menu&gt; is an unordered list of available command options.

They seem separate to me, I'm not sure we need to merge them further.

As I understand it the two key things about the Ribbon are that effects 
are instantly previewed (requires an &quot;onmouseover&quot;/&quot;onmouseout&quot; set of 
events on all commands, though not limited to mice of course) and the
fact 
that the ribbon is context sensitive (not hard just by showing/hiding 
commands on the fly). I haven't seen it first hand though so I may be 
mistaken.

It seems that it should be possible to implement that kind of UI with 
almost any toolbar-like solution that we come up with.
