While that is certainly true, at the same time there appears to be a strong
trend towards using automated Web publishing systems (CMSs, wikis, blogs,
forums, etc.). Such a system will often 'know' already what the sitemap 'is'
and could thus probably easily generate it automagically. I think it would
make sense to adjust a spec not only to what human HTML authors can/will use,
but also take into account what automated systems can/will.

(Btw, I don't know if it would have to be a 'sitemap'. The profile attribute
to HEAD seems to apply to this.)
