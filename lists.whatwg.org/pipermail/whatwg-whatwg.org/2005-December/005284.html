And that is the vicious cycle that means &lt;link&gt; navigation will never=20
be viable. As long as *any* widely-used browser does not implement it=20
reliably, Web authors will have to duplicate &lt;link&gt;s with navigation in=20=

the &lt;body&gt; (unless they UA-sniff, which will usually be too much=20
trouble). As long as sites using &lt;link&gt; navigation have to duplicate it=20=

in the &lt;body&gt;, most of them won't bother, making it a low priority for=20=

browser vendors. And as long as sites using &lt;link&gt; navigation have to=20
duplicate it in the &lt;body&gt;, browser vendors will have an incentive=20
*not* to support it reliably, because if they do, &lt;link&gt;ed sites will=20
have confusingly redundant navigation when viewed in that browser.

That could perhaps be worked around by surrounding fallback navigation=20=

with a &lt;nolink&gt; element, to be presented by browsers that didn't=20
support &lt;link&gt; (analagous to &lt;noframes&gt;). But there are other problems,=20=

such as the vast majority of authors not *wanting* to entrust their=20
navigation to a one-presentation-fits-all navigation bar. See Google=20
Directory, IMDb, and Ask MetaFilter for examples of vastly differing=20
navigation requirements that would suffer from being made consistent=20
with each other. And see OS X's Expos=E9, OmniWeb's thumbnails, and=20
Firefox's Tab Sidebar extension for examples of features that benefit=20
from Web sites being visually inconsistent with each other. Sometimes=20
consistency is not a good thing.

As Ian alluded to, it's been ten years, two months, and 22 days since=20
the codification of &lt;link&gt;, and there is still no browser other than=20
Lynx that supports &lt;link&gt; navigation reliably enough for authors to be=20=

able to rely on it. (iCab and Opera don't count, because their toolbars=20=

can be turned off. The Firefox extension has the same problem, only=20
moreso.) You and I both tried to get &lt;link&gt; navigation off the ground,=20=

in our separate ways, but -- like Ian -- I really think it's a lost=20
cause now. Let it go. :-)
