This is also covered by &lt;a rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;, by the way. (Indeed, &lt;a rel&gt; is 
arguably better, since then UAs can highlight the link when you hit the 
shortcut key for &quot;next&quot;, which is considered good UI, iirc.)


&gt;<i> Absolute navigation includes links to fixed pages, the same on all pages 
</I>&gt;<i> of the site. Usually these are links to top-level sections and 
</I>&gt;<i> subsections thereof. Following an absolute link is like skipping to a 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed vertex in a graph, or resolving an absolute pathname on a 
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem. The absolute navigation is somewhat covered with the &lt;link&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism (rel=&quot;toc&quot;, for example), but it's not enough because the 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed nodes referenced by absolute navigation is rarely described with 
</I>&gt;<i> specific roles like &quot;TOC&quot;; more often, these are just top-level sections 
</I>&gt;<i> of the site.
</I>
Like &lt;link rel=&quot;section&quot; title=&quot;Products&quot; ...&gt;?


&gt;<i> Currently, we have &lt;link&gt; which works great in browsers which understand it.
</I>
Which is roughly none of them.


&gt;<i> For those who don't, authors usually duplicate relative navigation in 
</I>&gt;<i> the page body. For absolute navigation, though, they have no choice 
</I>&gt;<i> because there is no appropriate mechanism similar to &lt;link&gt; to instruct 
</I>&gt;<i> browsers to include absolute navigation somewhere in its UI outside the 
</I>&gt;<i> viewport.
</I>
Realistically speaking, authors don't use &lt;link&gt; anyway, though, as mpt 
pointed out.


&gt;<i> &gt; My theory is that there is an inverse relationship between the level 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of abstraction involved and the level of interest from authors. Site 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maps in external files are a kind of abstraction beyond most authors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Everyone puts CSS and JS in external files -- just to avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> repeating the same text on all or most pages of the site.
</I>
It's not the &quot;external file&quot; aspect that's the problem, it's the 
abstraction of having the site description at all.

(CSS, by the way, is not used by &quot;everyone&quot;. There are significant parts 
of the Web that don't use CSS, or that use it at most in style=&quot;&quot; 
attributes, thus completely missing the point of CSS.)


&gt;<i> And, well, everyone puts links to top-level sections of the site on 
</I>&gt;<i> every page, which is actually repetition.
</I>
Server-side includes are often used to fix this -- maybe we should 
consider ways to address this need rather than &lt;link&gt;, come to think of 
it. Especially in conjunction with &lt;a rel=&quot;&quot;&gt;, this could indirectly solve 
your problem.


&gt;<i> Also many authors put links to subsections of the top-level sections, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is even more repetition. To avoid the repetition, some use 
</I>&gt;<i> external JS to generate the menus, with JS arrays actually describing 
</I>&gt;<i> the site map. It's an ad-hoc solution to the same problem (how to not 
</I>&gt;<i> write the site map on every page), it's effectively the same level of 
</I>&gt;<i> abstraction, and it's just worse because it's not semantic, requires 
</I>&gt;<i> programmatic evaluation of JS, and is not standardized.
</I>
It's less abstract as far as the authors are concerned, because to them 
there is a direct relationship between the document.write() and what they 
see on their screen, as opposed to an indirect one that depends on the UA 
implementor's idea of navigation.
