</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> That could perhaps be worked around by surrounding fallback navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> with a &lt;nolink&gt; element, to be presented by browsers that didn't support 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;link&gt; (analagous to &lt;noframes&gt;). But there are other problems, such as 
</I>&gt;<i> the vast majority of authors not *wanting* to entrust their navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> to a one-presentation-fits-all navigation bar. See Google Directory, 
</I>&gt;<i> IMDb, and Ask MetaFilter for examples of vastly differing navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements that would suffer from being made consistent with each 
</I>&gt;<i> other. And see OS X's Expose, OmniWeb's thumbnails, and Firefox's Tab 
</I>&gt;<i> Sidebar extension for examples of features that benefit from Web sites 
</I>&gt;<i> being visually inconsistent with each other. Sometimes consistency is 
</I>&gt;<i> not a good thing.
</I>
And that too. :-)


&gt;<i> As Ian alluded to, it's been ten years, two months, and 22 days since 
</I>&gt;<i> the codification of &lt;link&gt;, and there is still no browser other than 
</I>&gt;<i> Lynx that supports &lt;link&gt; navigation reliably enough for authors to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to rely on it. (iCab and Opera don't count, because their toolbars 
</I>&gt;<i> can be turned off. The Firefox extension has the same problem, only 
</I>&gt;<i> moreso.) You and I both tried to get &lt;link&gt; navigation off the ground, 
</I>&gt;<i> in our separate ways,
</I>
Much as I did. See bugzilla bug 2800. (I filed that nearly six years ago.)


&gt;<i> but -- like Ian -- I really think it's a lost cause now. Let it go. :-)
</I>
Glad you agree!
