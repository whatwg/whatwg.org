</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; partly intended to address this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In theory you could use them through XMLHttpRequest, if that were

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; them as form submission methods.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's specified as allowed already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you think they should be left in? It wouldn't be an unreasonable

</I>&gt;<i> one else thinks it is a problem.
</I>
I think it would be useful (especially PUT, and especially in conjunction 
with the file-upload thing). As you say, it shouldn't be that hard to 
implement -- in fact, for PUT it's exactly the same behaviour as for POST, 
just with a different method name, and for DELETE you totally ignore the 
form data set.


&gt;<i> &gt; Fair enough for the other protocols, but in the case of data:, it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would actually be really useful from a debugging persective to be able 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to get ahold of the form submission data. Given how easy the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition for data: is to implement, do you still object to it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No strong objection, although the usefulness of this behavior seems 
</I>&gt;<i> limited and it would have to be a special case in the code.
</I>
Yes, and yes. The usefulness is mostly limited to debugging, but the 
implementation burden should be small.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Untrusted content&quot; is unclear. It implies the existence of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something that isn't &quot;untrusted content&quot;, i.e. &quot;trusted content&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Where is that defined? I do not believe it is defined anywhere, in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which case specifying its behavior seems non-useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have rephrased this sentence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this section is still somewhat problematic because a reasonable 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior is to allow &quot;get&quot; posts to &quot;file:&quot; URLs from a local file 
</I>&gt;<i> document that is not marked trusted in any special way, as such a 
</I>&gt;<i> document can already do normal &quot;file:&quot; URL loads anyway through other 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms.
</I>
Um, they shouldn't be able to. Or at least, in many UAs they can't.


&gt;<i> And this is much less risky than allowing execution of prgrams or 
</I>&gt;<i> writing/deleting of files.
</I>
Depends on what file you allow access to (/dev/mouse?)


&gt;<i> However, ignoring the method in this case would put UAs in conflict with 
</I>&gt;<i> this non-normative section, so at minimum it seems they would have to 
</I>&gt;<i> change to disallow &quot;post&quot;, &quot;put&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; entirely or be in conflict 
</I>&gt;<i> with this section. I'm not even sure if considering some content only 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;trusted&quot; enough for one of the four columns would satisfy this section.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But this does not seem like a very serious problem, now that the section 
</I>&gt;<i> is non-normative.
</I>
Right -- the entire section is non-normative so you can't be in conflict 
with it.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Well, submission behavior is also unspecified for &quot;gopher:&quot;, &quot;sip:&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;nfs:&quot;, and so forth. I do not think it is the spec's job to list 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; every URI scheme.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, but it's the spec's job to answer questions from implementors as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to exactly what they are supposed to do when the user submits a form 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a protocol they support. The protocols listed were those most 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely to be encountered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but this is difficult when the URI scheme is not properly 
</I>&gt;<i> defined yet.
</I>
sms: and smsto: are gone.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like most of the changes. I will review the revised file upload 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior and comment on that. I would also like to review the &quot;data:&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior in more detail to see if it seems appropriate. Other than that, 
</I>&gt;<i> I feel my concerns have been addressed, and I'll get back to you on the

Great, thanks.
