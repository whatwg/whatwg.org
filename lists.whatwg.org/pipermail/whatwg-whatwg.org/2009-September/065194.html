</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I'm not speccing something that so blatently allows users to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tracked without their consent -- and worse -- despite their attempts 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to stop it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't 'allow users to be tracked without their consent' any more 
</I>&gt;<i> than cookies by themselves do.
</I>
It's the second part that's the problem.


&gt;<i> If this is important, browsers will expose the ability to blow away all 
</I>&gt;<i> of a site's storages at once.
</I>
Right, that's what the spec encourages.


&gt;<i> You're seem to be assuming that either permanent Storage is *really* 
</I>&gt;<i> permanent, or that browsers will never expose a way to delete that data 
</I>&gt;<i> to the user (which amounts to the same).
</I>
Then I'm not expressing myself way. My concern is just that users will not 
realise that clearing away cookies doesn't stop sites from tracking them 
as it used to.


&gt;<i> Would an approach like the &lt;input type=save&gt; be okay, where the user has 
</I>&gt;<i> to explicitly take an action to enable permanent Storage for a site the 
</I>&gt;<i> first time?
</I>
There are plenty of use cases where there's nothing to explicitly save, so 
no, I don't think that would work.


&gt;<i> That makes simple navigation exactly as safe as it is today, where 
</I>&gt;<i> cookies can leak privacy but they can be wiped. You have to actively opt 
</I>&gt;<i> in to reducing your privacy.  I *want* to be able to reduce my privacy 
</I>&gt;<i> for sites that I trust.
</I>
Nothing is stopping you, is it?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; IMO this achieves what you're trying for while leaving the actual UI

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you mean this as a repalcement or in addition to what's in the spec

</I>&gt;<i> Replacement.
</I>
Ok, done.


&gt;<i> &gt; For the Cookie Resurrection section or the User Tracking section?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cookie resurrection section.  Although because the comments in both 
</I>&gt;<i> sections are so similar, I'm not sure I see value in having two 
</I>&gt;<i> sections.  Just having one, which has this text, seems fine.
</I>
Merged them together.
