SUMMARY:

I haven't removed the storage mutex. I don't see any other workable 
solution to the problem.

We can't change the API, as much as we'd like to, because it's already 
shipped in IE, and it would simply be dumb for us to screw Microsoft over 
here. It's hard enough to get them to implement specs without giving their 
management more reasons for not being on the cutting edge.

We can't simply remove the storage mutex, because then we'll have race 
conditions up the wazoo, especially for localStorage. We could probably 
get away with letting document.cookie be unprotected, since IE has done 
that for years and cookies aren't a high-traffic API, but who knows how 
many bugs that's really causing. If implementations don't implement the 
mutex around document.cookie access, I can't blame them, but it's a risk 
that each implementor needs to evaluate on their own, the spec isn't going 
to condone it.

I have made sure that as far as I am aware, there are no ways to 
synchronously invoke script from another origin in HTML5 without dropping 
the mutex (specifically, I've made history.back() and changing of 
document.domain drop the mutex), and I've made it so that you can only 
access localStorage objects of your effective script origin (i.e. changing 
document.domain means your localStorage is no longer accessible). This 
means that it should be possible to implement the storage mutex on a 
per-domain basis. This should minimise the potential damage.

I haven't added localStorage to workers, because it'd be too easy to grab 
the mutex and try to see if Pi is finite using a brute-force approach, 
leaving all the other event loops that try to grab the mutex SOL.

I haven't added an async callback to localStorage yet, because I don't 
imagine that most authors will use it given that they don't need to and 
see no problems when testing (you'd only see issues if you tested having 
two apps from the same domain both doing storage updates in long scripts).


LESSONS LEARNT

If we ever define a new API that needs a lock of some kind, the way to do 
it is to use a callback, so that the UA can wait for the lock 
asynchronously, and then run the callback once it has it. (This is what 
the Web Database spec does, for instance.)

The answer 0 would only be useful if you were to grab the storage mutex 
immediately upon receiving it, which defeats the point of the call.

What's the use case for this? I don't understand what a script making use

I think if we're willing to run the risk of pages stomping on each other, 
we should just go ahead and not have locking at all, rather than trying to 
show a consistent view that we know to be a lie.

That is, if this is going to fail when run in parallel:

   var count = getCookie('counter');
   counter += 1;
   setCookie('data' + counter, data);
   setCookie('counter', counter);

...then there's not much point worrying about whether the view is 
consistent. Either way, data loss will occur.

I think this is a non-starter, as described above.


&gt;<i> [transactions]
</I>
The problem with a system where transactions might fail based on timing is 
that there's not much for the author to do but just try again, and that's 
really not a good pattern to encourage. It's also likely that many authors 
won't notice the failure case, leading to just another kind of race 
condition very similar to what we're trying to avoid in the first place.

</I>
Not indefinitely -- only until the UA kills the script. Also, it should be 
possible to make this per-origin locks, so it would only lock up the pages 
that share its event loop or that are same-origin (or share the event loop 
of same-origin content). And then only if they themselves need the mutex.

I don't follow. Why would these break storage mutex semantics?

I would presume that the first one would just grab the mutex like anyone 
else. The &quot;close tab&quot; and &quot;quit UA&quot; cases don't seem to need the storage 
mutex. The &quot;slow script&quot; timeout would just spin the event loop, which 
releases the mutex. The &quot;store to disk failure&quot; and &quot;crash&quot; cases seem 
like exceptional cases unrelated to the storage mutex.

</I>
Sure, but there are far easier ways for that to happen, like an exception

</I>
I don't think it is a good idea to ignore the other sites, in particular 
because frankly a case like GMail is far more likely to want to use the 
Web Database feature with full transactions going on than localStorage. 
However, it's quite possible to build crash-safe transactions on top of 
localStorage if you have the implied locking semantics of the storage 
mutex, so if authors want to handle that case, they can.

WebDatabase transactions just always grab a lock on the DB. You decide 
when creating the transaction whether it's a read lock or a write lock. If 
you get a read lock, writes fail. If you get a write lock, you get an 
exclusive lock for the entire database before your callback runs. They can 
have side-effects, and they never get retried, because they can't fail 
unpredictably.

If you call a plugin, all bets are off anyway. I mean, the plugin could go

I'm not aware of any spec that fires 'resize' events currently. They 
should either fire asynchronously or release the mutex, though.

You can't nest async Web Database transactions in anything, the Web 
Database callbacks are called from the top-level event loop. You can get 
deadlocks in Workers with sync transactions (e.g. opening a write 
transaction inside another transaction, or a read transaction inside a 
write transaction), but they're not race condition deadlocks, they're 
reproduceable logic errors. (I expect UAs will detect those cases and just 
fire the timeout exception immediately, though the spec doesn't 
technically require that.)

The problem is that sites that _don't_ check will work fine in IE8, and 
fail everywhere else, and if IE8 gets enough market share that people 
write pages that work with ie without checking other browsers, as happened 
with IE6 for example, then we'll be forced to implement this anyway, 
except Microsoft will get bad PR for being incompatible and acting 
monopolistically. On the other hand, if, say, Firefox implements this 
proposal, and it gets enough market share that the opposite happens, then 
IE is SOL, because people will be calling .transaction() and it'll fail in 
IE. Either way, Microsoft end up being burnt for having done the right 
thing, implementing cutting edge specs, and then we run the risk of them 
backing off even further from doing that again.

A method called allowFoo() feels to me like it should be paired with

Anyway I think yieldForStorageUpdates() is fine. I somewhat prefer

Web Database is still very much in flux. However, localStorage is more or 
less fixed because Microsoft shipped it and their release cycle means they 
won't ship changes to it before it is solidly embedded in too many sites 
to risk changes.

With a sync access model, this wouldn't help. You'd still need one lock 
for each storage area, otherwise a single event loop could end up trying 
to aquire too locks while another is doing the opposite, and they would 
deadlock.

We could have an additional API for async localstorage access that did 
this division of data, but it's not clear that the additional value of 
this makes it worth it given that we'd have to still offer the current API 
as well. I don't think many people would use the new API.

I think the few cases where it happens are actually pretty reasonable:

 - changing document.domain
 - history.back(), .forward(), .go(n)
 - invoking a plugin
 - alert(), confirm(), prompt(), print()
 - showModalDialog()
 - yieldForStorageUpdates()

To examine each in turn:

 - changing document.domain
   After this, you can't access your storage area anymore anyway.

 - history.back(), .forward(), .go(n)
   Usually this unloads your document anyway. In the case where you're 
   navigating an iframe, I could see some confusion arising, but it is 
   likely quite a rare operation.

 - invoking a plugin
   All bets are off when calling a plugin.

 - alert(), confirm(), prompt(), print()
 - showModalDialog()
   These are all fire long-term modal dialogs, so it makes sense that the 
   storage area could change while they're running.

 - yieldForStorageUpdates()
   That's the point of the method.

You can get into a situation where the database query started from 
showModalDialog() fails to ever aqcuire the lock and call its callback, 
yes. The user can always manually dismiss the modal window, though, so 
it's not a disaster (the callback would then run when the window was 
closed and the parent transaction finishd). It's also reproduceable, so 
it's not going to be that hard to debug.

The same problem exists in workers, where you have synchronous 
transactions.

Right now, if the showModalDialog() is called from a write transaction, 
nested transactions on the same database always fail, and from a read 
transaction, nested write transactions always fail (in both cases, 
assuming the user doesn't close the window and let the callback fire once 
the parent transaction has finished). I think that's fine, we don't need 
to either drop transactional semantics or block all nested transactions or 
modal dialogs of any kind. We already have an error callback that fires 
when the UA times out, and the UA could detect this situation and report 
the likely cause of the timeout with a warning to the console to report it 
for debugging purposes. I don't think it's a particularly big problem.

If your script is linking processes in this way then you can have far more

I don't think we want to hang user experience on a hope that authors will 
do the right thing. We've lost every time we've made that bet in the past.

The only way I could see making localStorage visible to workers is with a 
mechanism that took a finite list of operations to do and that could do 
them asynchronously. However, short of inventing a new language like SQL, 
or an elaborate API with some sort of symbolic expressions, I don't really 
see how to expose that sanely.

We could let the script see a stale copy of the data and have it say when 
it wants its changes committed back, but then we'd overwrite data left 
right and centre, as described earlier. Other solutions like explicit 
locks and transactions that can fail unpredictably are equally big 
pitfalls for Web authors.

At least with what we have now the worst case scenario is pretty well 
understood and is actually no worse than all pages from a particular 
origin doing &quot;while (true) {}&quot; all at once, which is already possible, 
and just results in a &quot;slow script&quot; dialog.

I think we should be very careful before introducing a fourth storage 
mechanism to make sure that whatever we introduce really is something 
that's going to be very useful and really solve problems. I'd really 
rather not rush into adding yet another mechanism at this point.
