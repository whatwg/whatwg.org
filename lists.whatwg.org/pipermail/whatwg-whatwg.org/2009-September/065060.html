</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In general, I agree with Rob about this proposal. &#160;What problem with storage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mutex as spec'd today does your proposal solve?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The spec requires a single storage mutex for the entire UA. Therefore
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in a MELUA a web page can become unresponsive while waiting for some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other page to give up the lock. This is not good and something we have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tried to avoid everywhere else in the spec.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Attempts to address this by doing per-origin locks wind up with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deadlocks being possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How could this happen. It certainly does sound scary to have a bunch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of locks that can be grabbed in arbitrary order, but I can't off the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> top of my head think of any ways where deadlocks can happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From a Hixie mail way back in March:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018991.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018991.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> If it can be shown that it is not ever possible for script in one origin
</I>&gt;<i> to synchronously invoke script in another origin, then I guess we could
</I>&gt;<i> have per-origin locks instead of a single lock.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are two cases I know of where it is possible to have synchronous
</I>&gt;<i> script execution across origins:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Plugins. It is possible for script to invoke a plugin function in
</I>&gt;<i> one frame, and for the plugin to synchronously execute script in
</I>&gt;<i> another frame. We have addressed this in the spec by saying that
</I>&gt;<i> invoking a plugin releases the storage mutex, but that doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> solve the problem. We are exchanging violation of run-to-completion
</I>&gt;<i> for deadlock. I guess it is an improvement, but it is still a bug.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * In WebKit, onresize is invoked synchronously. You can cause
</I>&gt;<i> cross-origin synchronous script execution by resizing an iframe.
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK, the spec does not disallow this event from being synchronous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I found the second case after only a few minutes of thinking about it.
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect there are more since it was never a design goal to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous script execution across origins.
</I>
When we designed postMessage it certainly was a design goal to make
synchronous cross-origin script execution never happen. As I
understood it for two reasons:

1. The script in the origin being &quot;called&quot; would never know how much
JS stack was available, and so could never reliably call a function.
This was particularly a concern expressed by chrome developers.
2. This would force the two origins to run in the same process (or at
least processes running in lock-step).

&gt;<i> We could patch each case like this by releasing the mutex, but each
</I>&gt;<i> time we do that, we poke another hole in run to completion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also suspect such patches will be difficult to maintain. Even if we
</I>&gt;<i> update implementations to invoke onresize asynchronously, how
</I>&gt;<i> confident can we be in interactions between such unrelated components
</I>&gt;<i> as event dispatch and storage continuing to work correctly?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, even with these hacks, we have problems. In a MELUA (I love
</I>&gt;<i> that acronym!), with per-origin local storage mutexes, we still can
</I>&gt;<i> end up with unresponsive UI because it is possible to have the same
</I>&gt;<i> origin running on different event loops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding an asynchronous step to acquire the mutex neatly solves all
</I>&gt;<i> these problems. We get run-to-completion, and we never block an event
</I>&gt;<i> loop on waiting for a mutex.
</I>
But we have to break compat with existing pages...
