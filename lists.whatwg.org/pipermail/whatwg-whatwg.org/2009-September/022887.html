I forgive you :).

In fact, the many design changes to the database API were made
precisely because they made it more webby, within the constraints of
being SQL-based. As on example, the fully asynchronous API was done to
avoid blocking the UI thead, something that is important for web
browsers. All of this played out on the WhatWG mailing list over
several months with input from many vendors, but admittedly, mostly
Google and Apple (not for want of other input -- just because we
seemed to be the two that most wanted this feature).

&gt;<i> Do you agree with Jeremy that Database is too far along in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> deployment to have significant changes made to it? &#160;Given that we're
</I>&gt;<i> still hashing our major philosophical elements with respect to

</I>&gt;<i> on. &#160;&quot;Does the localStorage mutex plus onbeforeunload plus Database
</I>&gt;<i> transaction collision equal deadlock?&quot;, etc.
</I>
I don't think that is what Jeremy was saying (emphasis mine):

Picking another message from very early in the other thread that
spawned this one:

Throughout, he has reiterated his belief that we are *not* too far
along to change the design.

I think this thread has gotten long enough and involves enough people
that every possible position has already been laid out, and we
continue only out of brownian motion.
