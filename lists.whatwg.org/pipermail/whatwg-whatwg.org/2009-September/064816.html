</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The trouble with this is it doesn't allow any experimentation on the part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the app/entity to figure out what is the best idle time for it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purposes.  In terms of chat it might be that a 3 minute or 5 minute idle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time works best in terms of people's attention.  For something like watching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a video perhaps a 15 minute idle would be a better length of time, or for an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> online game a longer idle time is probably useful before being signed out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Different purposes have different requirements for the idle time so it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes sense to allow them to specify the different timeouts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This requirement could be solved in several other ways, f ex making sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the &quot;standard&quot; timeout period is short enough to not be longer than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what any app wants. Then (as was previously suggested) an app that wants a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> longer timeout can do setTimeout and trigger its own idle stuff if status
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has not come back to &quot;active&quot; during that time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we went the route of using events, I definitely think this is the way to
</I>&gt;<i> go.  Since the originally proposed API was based off of the timer API,
</I>&gt;<i> you're really only adding one step if you want that behavior.  Having a
</I>&gt;<i> globally configured value seems sloppy and you'll have to manually use
</I>&gt;<i> timeouts if, for example, you were using 2 libraries that used it for
</I>&gt;<i> different purposes and thus wanted different idle timeouts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have been thinking about this.  I think this sounds reasonable too,
perhaps we should specify a minimum idle event timeout?  For example make
the event fire after 2 minutes idle?  Be easy to hook up to the property
without a timeout to see if the user is still idle after this time.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another alternative is to have no event, and just a property:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     window.lastUserActionTime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is kept updated with the &quot;msec since epoch&quot; for the latest user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input on the desktop. Then an app can implement its own idle functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with totally own rules. This API has the drawback of maybe exposing too much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information (the rate of input events to other apps), but may spawn some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideas.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you're poling, which seems pretty ugly.  I'd much prefer events to
</I>&gt;<i> this.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One issue:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is the user idle when the tab is in the background, when the browser is in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the background, or when the user is away from the machine? These are all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distinct cases of different levels of &quot;idleness&quot;, and it's largely depended
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the use case which kind of &quot;idleness&quot; makes sense for a particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would argue that &quot;when the browser is in the background&quot; should be no
</I>&gt;<i> different from &quot;when the tab is in the background&quot;.  Given that the
</I>&gt;<i> information the system uses to determine idleness (mouse movements and such)
</I>&gt;<i> are all available to a web app while it's in the foreground tab, it seems as
</I>&gt;<i> though knowing the idle time just from the perspective of your tab is not
</I>&gt;<i> terribly useful.  So, to me, I think it's pretty clear this should be system
</I>&gt;<i> wide idleness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I agree idlessness form being in the background should be a different
event/information if it is supported.

I will update my document with these ideas and then repost.

Thanks,
David.
