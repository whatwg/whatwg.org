Ah, you beat me to it. I was just about to write an email to the list,  
honestly. ;-)

So anyway, the upshot of my somewhat unscientific survey[1] conducted  
at a workshop a couple of weeks ago is that there is great confusion  
between the &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; elements.

In that blog post, I point out that &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; were once  
more divergent but have converged over time (since the @cite and  
@pubdate attributes were dropped from &lt;article&gt;).

I've also seen a lot of confusion from authors wondering when to use  
&lt;section&gt; and when to use &lt;article&gt;. Bruce wrote an article on HTML5  
doctor recently to address this:
<A HREF="http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/">http://html5doctor.com/the-section-element/</A>

Probably the best tutorial I've seen on this issue is from Ted:
<A HREF="http://edward.oconnor.cx/2009/09/using-the-html5-sectioning-elements">http://edward.oconnor.cx/2009/09/using-the-html5-sectioning-elements</A>

...but even so, the confusion remains. The very fact that tutorials  
are required for what should be intuitive structural elements is  
worrying &#8212; I don't see the same issues around &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt; or  
&lt;footer&gt; (now that the content model has been changed) ...although  
there is continuing confusion around &lt;aside&gt;.

Anyway...

Is there a strong enough case for having two separate new elements or  
they close enough in functionality that one of them could be dropped?

Personally, I don't have a strong opinion about which element name  
should be dropped, but I do think that dropping one of them would make  
life easier for authors.

Thoughts?
