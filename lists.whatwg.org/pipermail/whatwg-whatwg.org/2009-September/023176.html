</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; diverge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on this issue, it'd be worth taking the power away from SessionStorage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; J
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Speaking from experience, I have been using localStorage in my PhD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; thesis work w/o any real need for structured clones (I would have used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Web Database but it isn't widely used yet and I was not sure if it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; going to make the cut in the end). All it took to come close to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; simulating structured clones now was to develop my own compatibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; wrapper for localStorage (<A HREF="http://realstorage.googlecode.com">http://realstorage.googlecode.com</A> for those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; who care) and add setJSONObject() and getJSONObject() methods on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; wrapper. Works w/o issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, this seems like a prime reason *to* add structured storage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support. Obviously string data wasn't enough for you so you had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write extra code in order to work around that. If structured clones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had been natively supported you both would have had to write less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code, and the resulting algorithms would have been faster. Faster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since the browser can serialize/parser to/from a binary internal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format faster than to/from JSON through the JSON serializer/parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but since LocalStorage is already widely deployed, authors are stuck
</I>&gt;<i> with the the structured clone-less version of LocalStorage for a very long
</I>&gt;<i> time. &#160;So the only way an app can store anything that can't be JSONified is
</I>&gt;<i> to break backwards&#160;compatibility.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Despite localStorage unfortunate locking contention problem, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become quite a popular API. It's also very successful in terms of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browser deployment since it's available in at least latest versions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IE, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. Don't know about support in Opera?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The more popular it becomes, the more it's going to hurt UA developers, web
</I>&gt;<i> developers, and users. &#160;I don't see why this is an argument for making it
</I>&gt;<i> more powerful.
</I>
How will it hurt UA developers? I think we're stuck forever to
implement the locking mechanism. Adding more datatypes to the API
doesn't mean that we'll have to implement it more.

&gt;<i> In addition, this argument assumes that Microsoft (and other UAs) will
</I>&gt;<i> implement the structured clone version of LocalStorage. &#160;Has anyone (or can
</I>&gt;<i> anyone) from Microsoft comment on this?
</I>
Given that I've never heard microsoft commit to a webstandard, ever, I
doubt that we'll hear anything here. Or that the lack of hearing
anything means we can draw any conclusions.

&gt;<i> This is not a small feature to add. &#160;Yes, it's smaller than creating a new
</I>&gt;<i> storage mechanism (that everyone is willing to adopt), but I still think
</I>&gt;<i> that's what we should be looking at. &#160;Rather than polishing a turd.
</I>
I do think that localStorage is a decent API that developers will want
to, and should, use. I think looking into adding a async accessor to
get a storage object so that people can use an localStorage-like API
while avoiding risks of blocking. This would also allow sharing data
between worker threads and the main window.
