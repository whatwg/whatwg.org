</I>&gt;<i> I replied to the originator of this thread, but forgot to include the

</I>&gt;<i> images.  As of IE8, all of the major browsers support data URI's for 
</I>&gt;<i> images, but none of them will generate that on paste...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I work on Xinha(WYSIWYG editor), and I know that it's possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> generate this with Gears, or maybe also with Canvas, but I don't see how

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what the original poster was asking about, but one issue 
</I>&gt;<i> I've encountered in this area is that users want to embed images from 
</I>&gt;<i> their own local drives rather than having to separately upload them to 
</I>&gt;<i> the server first.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the in-browser editors often make it look like this is 
</I>&gt;<i> going to work; users manage to get embedded images with <A HREF="file://">file://</A> URLs 
</I>&gt;<i> that seem to work for that user but obviously will not work for any 
</I>&gt;<i> other user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I'm not sure what the solution is here. If contentEditable was 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;real&quot; form widget you could imagine it supporting a 
</I>&gt;<i> multipart/form-data upload of all of its contained images, or something. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, as long as client-side code is manually shifting the data to 
</I>&gt;<i> and from real widgets it's not clear how to do this since you can't just 
</I>&gt;<i> create a file-upload control with the filename pre-populated and submit 
</I>&gt;<i> it transparently.
</I>
This is now handled by drag-and-drop and &lt;input type=file&gt; supporting 
local File access.

This is possible now.
