Ay, there's the rub: I think the disagreement is between &quot;mutex&quot; vs. 
&quot;transaction&quot; semantics.  So far, I think perhaps &quot;mutex&quot; has been used 
as shorthand for &quot;transaction.&quot;  But they aren't the same.

I think we all agree that a script may fail to modify localStorage in 
some situations (irrespective of global mutex vs. per-domain mutex). 
One camp, wanting &quot;mutex&quot; semantics, would prefer to pretend that the 
failures never happen and let scripts clean up the mess 
(partially-applied changes) if they do occur.  This is semantically 
broken, IMHO.

The second camp, wanting &quot;transaction&quot; semantics, explicitly acknowledge 
to web authors that localStorage is fallible, guarantee that 
modifications to localStorage are atomic, and notify scripts when 
modifications can't be made atomically.  This is the same approach taken 
by Web Database.  IMHO, this is much better semantically because (i) it 
gives web apps stronger guarantees; and (ii) it makes the discussion 
about global mutex/per-domain mutex/non-blocking an implementation issue 
rather semantic issue, as it should be.

Can those in the first camp explain why &quot;mutex&quot; semantics is better than 
&quot;transaction&quot; semantics?  And why it's desirable to have one DB spec 
specify &quot;transaction&quot; semantics (Web Database) and a second specify 
&quot;mutex&quot; semantics (localStorage)?

&gt;<i> Note: you're mentioning synchronous transactions here. I think that
</I>&gt;<i> the callback for localStorage.transaction() *must* be run
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronously to avoid blocking on access to the storage. I presume
</I>&gt;<i> this is what you meant. Right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I think this is an orthogonal issue concerning per-&quot;tab&quot; script 
responsiveness vs. author friendliness.  One could argue for async-only, 
sync-only, or both.

Cheers,
Chris
