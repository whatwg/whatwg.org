Yes, there is ambiguity in getItem() between the case of non existent key  
or the case or null key.
But does storing null keys adds any value, or relevant information ?

The User Agent could optimize by treating a setItem(key, null) as a  
removeItem() because getItem() would return in both cases null, and it  
would be an opportunity to spend less quota of the storage area. The only  
side effect of such optimization would be that setItem(key, null) would  
not produce a new key entry that could be read by key(index).

But back on the original issue, doing a setItem(key,null) is just  
redundant overhead that does not had any information, so the spec could  
just allow the harmless ambiguity to happen.
I personally would prefer setItem(key,null/undefined) to be treated as  
removeItem(key).
