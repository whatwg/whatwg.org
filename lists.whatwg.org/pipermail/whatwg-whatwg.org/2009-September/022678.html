<PRE>Interesting. I've been following this discussion as my
experience is that it is *extremely* hard to make an
invisible locking mechanism that is to provide both 
consistency and performance (no lockouts). 
So far it seems a silver bullet hasn't been found.

Your suggestion is in line with what I would expect from a 
solution that makes a &quot;best effort&quot; compromise between the
multi-tab browsing experience and the burden put on 
application authors.

What if cookies are accessed between beginTransaction() and
commitTransaction(), would it make sense to throw for 
updates with side-effects here as well? (Even though this
would not be the case if done outside the transaction.)
In some cases it may be helpful to get this &quot;side-effect
notification&quot; for cookies as well...

Best regards
Mike Wilson

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[whatwg] Storage mutex and cookies can lead to browser deadlock&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> thread.  Roughly, this proposal would give scripts a 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent view of 
</I>&gt;<i> document.cookie until they completed.  AIUI this is stronger 
</I>&gt;<i> consistency 
</I>&gt;<i> than Google Chrome provides today, and anecdotal evidence 
</I>&gt;<i> suggests even 
</I>&gt;<i> their weaker consistency hasn't &quot;broken the web.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage would be changed in a non-backwards-compatible way.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe that web apps can be partitioned into two classes: those that 
</I>&gt;<i> have planned for running concurrently (single-event-loop or not) in 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple &quot;browsing contexts&quot;, and those that haven't.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> further posit 
</I>&gt;<i> that the second class would break when run concurrently in multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> contexts regardless of multiple event loops, and thus 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of the 
</I>&gt;<i> storage mutex.  Even in the single-event-loop world, sites 
</I>&gt;<i> not prepared 
</I>&gt;<i> to be loaded in multiple tabs can stomp each other's data even though 
</I>&gt;<i> script execution is atomic.  (I wouldn't dare use my bank's 
</I>&gt;<i> website in 
</I>&gt;<i> two tabs at the same time in a single-event-loop browser.)  In other 
</I>&gt;<i> words, storage mutex can't help the second class of sites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I also believe that there's a very large, third class of pages that 
</I>&gt;<i> work &quot;accidentally&quot; when run concurrently in multiple contexts, even 
</I>&gt;<i> though they don't plan for that.  This is likely because they 
</I>&gt;<i> don't keep 
</I>&gt;<i> quasi-persistent data on the client side.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on that, I believe localStorage should be designed with 
</I>&gt;<i> the first 
</I>&gt;<i> class of web apps (those that have considered data consistency across 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple concurrent contexts) in mind, rather than the second 
</I>&gt;<i> class.  Is 
</I>&gt;<i> a conceptual global storage mutex the best way for, say, gmail to 
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee consistency of its e-mail/contacts database?  I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't believe 
</I>&gt;<i> so: I think that a transactional localStorage is preferable. 
</I>&gt;<i> Transactional localStorage is easier for browser vendors to implement 
</I>&gt;<i> and should result in better performance for web apps in multi-process 
</I>&gt;<i> UAs.  It's more of a burden on web app authors than the 
</I>&gt;<i> hidden storage 
</I>&gt;<i> mutex, but I think the benefits outweigh the cost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I propose adding the functions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    window.localStorage.beginTransaction()
</I>&gt;<i>    window.localStorage.commitTransaction()
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>    window.beginTransaction()
</I>&gt;<i>    window.commitTransaction()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (The latter might be preferable if we later decide to add 
</I>&gt;<i> more resources 
</I>&gt;<i> with transactional semantics.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage.getItem(),. setItem(), .removeItem(), and .clear() would 
</I>&gt;<i> remain specified as they are today.  beginTransaction() would do just 
</I>&gt;<i> that, open a transaction.  Calling localStorage.*() outside 
</I>&gt;<i> of an open 
</I>&gt;<i> transaction would cause a script exception to be thrown; this would 
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately break all current clients of localStorage.  
</I>&gt;<i> There might be 
</I>&gt;<i> cleverer ways to mitigate this breakage by a UA pretending not to 
</I>&gt;<i> support localStorage until a script called beginTransaction().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yieldForStorageUpdates() would no longer be meaningful and should be 
</I>&gt;<i> removed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A transaction would successfully &quot;commit&quot;, atomically applying its 
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to localStorage, if localStorage was not 
</I>&gt;<i> modified between 
</I>&gt;<i> beginTransaction() and commitTransaction().  Note that a transaction 
</I>&gt;<i> consisting entirely of getItem() could fail just as those actually 
</I>&gt;<i> modifying localStorage.  If a transaction failed, the UA 
</I>&gt;<i> would throw a 
</I>&gt;<i> TransactionFailed exception to script.  The UA would be 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to throw 
</I>&gt;<i> this exception at any time between beginTransaction() and 
</I>&gt;<i> commitTransaction().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are numerous ways to implement transactional semantics. 
</I>&gt;<i> Single-event-loop UAs could implement beginTransaction() and 
</I>&gt;<i> commitTransaction() as no-ops.  Multi-event-loop UAs could reuse the 
</I>&gt;<i> global storage mutex if they had already implemented that 
</I>&gt;<i> (beginTransaction() == lock, commitTransaction() == unlock).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some edge cases:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * calling commitTransaction() without beginTransaction() 
</I>&gt;<i> would throw 
</I>&gt;<i> an exception
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * transactions would not be allowed to be nested, even on different 
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage DBs.  E.g. if site A's script begins a transaction on 
</I>&gt;<i> A.localStorage, and calls into site B's script embedded in an iframe 
</I>&gt;<i> which begins a transaction on B.localStorage, an exception 
</I>&gt;<i> would be thrown.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * transactions *could* be spread across script executions, alert() 
</I>&gt;<i> dialogs, sync XHR, or anywhere else the current HTML5 spec 
</I>&gt;<i> requires the 
</I>&gt;<i> storage mutex be released.  Note that UAs wishing to forbid that 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior could simply throw a TransactionFailed exception where the 
</I>&gt;<i> storage mutex would have been released in the current spec.  Or this 
</I>&gt;<i> could be made illegal by the spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * it's not clear to me how to handle async XHRs and Worker messages 
</I>&gt;<i> sent from within a failed transaction.  They could be specified to be 
</I>&gt;<i> sent or not and either behavior implemented easily.  My gut tells me 
</I>&gt;<i> that they *should* be sent regardless.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback very much desired.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Chris
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Addendum: I think that a past argument against a 
</I>&gt;<i> transactional approach 
</I>&gt;<i> was that scripts can cause side effects during transactions 
</I>&gt;<i> that can't 
</I>&gt;<i> be (easily, performantly) rolled back.  This is true, and 
</I>&gt;<i> troubling in 
</I>&gt;<i> that it deviates from SQL semantics, but because this proposal is 
</I>&gt;<i> designed for the first class of web apps I don't believe it's a 
</I>&gt;<i> compelling argument.  Further, a script can only corrupt its 
</I>&gt;<i> browsing-context-local state by mishandling failed 
</I>&gt;<i> transactions.  Using 
</I>&gt;<i> gmail as a convenient example, if a transaction failed but 
</I>&gt;<i> gmail wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> prepared to handle the failure, that particular gmail instance would 
</I>&gt;<i> just break.  No e-mails or contacts would be corrupted, and the user 
</I>&gt;<i> could reload gmail and regain full functionality.  Servers should 
</I>&gt;<i> already be prepared to deal with clients behaving unpredictably.
</I>&gt;<i>
