Ah.  I must have been unclear.  We (Gecko) consider it a bug that a 
display:none &lt;object&gt; in a document doesn't instantiate the plug-in.  I 
don't think we have an opinion yet on &lt;object&gt;s that are not in 
documents at all; I suspect making those instantiate would be 
suboptimal, but that's really just a gut feeling with no data to back it up.

Indeed.  Thanks!

&gt;&gt;<i> As far as text/plain goes, the current spec text means that if I have a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attribute with the value &quot;text/plain&quot; then the data will be treated as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application/postscript.  That doesn't seem desirable to me.  Is it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intentional?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. This is the same as happens if you navigate straight to such a file, 
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I can tell. Why would we not want that?
</I>
One difference is that in this case in addition to the text/plain 
content-type header (which we know is untrustworthy) there is also an 
out-of-band @type attribute saying text/plain, which presumably 
represents the author's wishes.

Since the whole point of text/plain sniffing is a workaround around a 
known issue where content is reliably mis-marked as text/plain, and 
since in this case there is a source of MIME information that's more 
reliable than that, it's not clear to me why we want to continue sniffing.

Of course if there is no @type there is no problem; I'm specifically 
concerned about the @type=&quot;text/plain&quot; case here.

My concern about text/plain data being sniffed as text/html by your 
current algorithm (even with the changes you've made) seems to remain 
unaddressed.  That's a critical issue, no?
