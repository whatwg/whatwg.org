</I>&gt;<i>             your proposal in this case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         If so, I agree with roc's responses to them that they could probably

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         OTOH, I'm not really against adding the concept of fallibility here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>             In fact, I believe that the &quot;Synchronous database API&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             describes the same
</I>&gt;<i>             transaction semantics as I proposed in the OP.  That spec
</I>&gt;<i>             adds implicit
</I>&gt;<i>             begin/commitTransaction and read-only transactions, but
</I>&gt;<i>             otherwise the
</I>&gt;<i>             semantics are the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>             So I'd like to amend my original proposal to be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>              Use Synchronous Web Database API transaction semantics.
</I>&gt;<i>              Except do not
</I>&gt;<i>             offer readTransaction: a transaction is implicitly a
</I>&gt;<i>             read-only transaction
</I>&gt;<i>             if only getItem() is called on localStorage from within
</I>&gt;<i>             localStorage.transaction().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Agree. That is what I was trying to propose, too. I'm not sure where
</I>&gt;<i>         we disagree :). Is it just that my proposal has no concept of
</I>&gt;<i>         errors?
</I>&gt;<i>         I'm not against adding them, mainly I was trying to keep my proposal
</I>&gt;<i>         simple for purposes of discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ay, there's the rub: I think the disagreement is between &quot;mutex&quot; vs.
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;transaction&quot; semantics.  So far, I think perhaps &quot;mutex&quot; has been
</I>&gt;<i>     used as shorthand for &quot;transaction.&quot;  But they aren't the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I think we all agree that a script may fail to modify localStorage
</I>&gt;<i>     in some situations (irrespective of global mutex vs. per-domain
</I>&gt;<i>     mutex). One camp, wanting &quot;mutex&quot; semantics, would prefer to pretend
</I>&gt;<i>     that the failures never happen and let scripts clean up the mess
</I>&gt;<i>     (partially-applied changes) if they do occur.  This is semantically
</I>&gt;<i>     broken, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The second camp, wanting &quot;transaction&quot; semantics, explicitly
</I>&gt;<i>     acknowledge to web authors that localStorage is fallible, guarantee
</I>&gt;<i>     that modifications to localStorage are atomic, and notify scripts
</I>&gt;<i>     when modifications can't be made atomically.  This is the same
</I>&gt;<i>     approach taken by Web Database.  IMHO, this is much better
</I>&gt;<i>     semantically because (i) it gives web apps stronger guarantees; and
</I>&gt;<i>     (ii) it makes the discussion about global mutex/per-domain
</I>&gt;<i>     mutex/non-blocking an implementation issue rather semantic issue, as
</I>&gt;<i>     it should be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Can those in the first camp explain why &quot;mutex&quot; semantics is better
</I>&gt;<i>     than &quot;transaction&quot; semantics?  And why it's desirable to have one DB
</I>&gt;<i>     spec specify &quot;transaction&quot; semantics (Web Database) and a second
</I>&gt;<i>     specify &quot;mutex&quot; semantics (localStorage)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The way I understand it, there's 3 camps...and I think they've been 
</I>&gt;<i> abusing both the word transaction and mutex.  We should probably all 
</I>&gt;<i> start being more precise with our wording in this respect.  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'd like to refine the above description of the design space.  I think 
there are three main design decisions: what ACID properties are 
guaranteed and at what granularity, sync and/or async API, and whether 
or not scripts can be notified when modifications to localStorage fail.

In the current localStorage spec, the unit of atomicity/consistency is 
each modification (setItem()/removeItem()/clear()) of localStorage.  But 
the unit of isolation is all operations to localStorage between 
acquiring the storage mutex and releasing it.  And durability isn't 
specified AFAICT.  And AFAICT, scripts can observe some failed 
modifications to localStorage, but not all.

In the current Web Database spec, the unit of A/C/I is each transaction, 
i.e., all executeSql() statements invoked on a Transaction object. 
Durability isn't defined, but it seems reasonable to assume that 
successful Transactions should be durable (best effort).  So a 
Transaction object is (best-effort) ACID.  Scripts *can* observe failed 
transactions and thus &quot;rolled-back&quot; changes.

The first point on which the new proposals for localStorage in this 
thread differ is whether to guarantee ACID (best effort) at a *uniform* 
granularity or not.  All the proposals have some notion of &quot;begin&quot; and 
&quot;end&quot;.  All of the proposals seem to want all operations between begin 
and end to be isolated (although some implementations in the wild do not 
guarantee this).  Some choose individual operations 
(get/set/remove/clear) of localStorage as the unit of 
atomicity/consistency.  This allows for some modifications between begin 
and end to be applied even if all changes couldn't be applied.  Others 
choose all modifications between begin and end as the unit of 
atomicity/consistency.  For this last group, &quot;end&quot; really means 
&quot;commit&quot;, because begin/commit define a transaction in the sense of Web 
Database's Transaction objects.

Semantically, an async vs. sync API doesn't change anything.  It does, 
however, affect the optimizations available to implementations.  An 
async callback might only be invoked by a SELUA when localStorage was 
loaded from disk into memory, so that the app could handle events in the 
mean time rather than blocking on disk.  In addition, a MELUA with a 
mutex implementation might only invoke the localStorage callback when 
the mutex could be acquired (e.g. only when a trylock() succeeded).  I'm 
beginning to be convinced that async callbacks are superior because of 
more flexible (and possibly performant) implementation options.

Finally there's observable vs. unobservable &quot;failures.&quot;  What &quot;failure&quot; 
means depends on the subset of ACID preserved, and at what granularity. 
  Some proposals do not allow scripts to observe failures.  For any 
proposal wishing to expand the unit of atomicity/consistency beyond 
single modifications (single set/remove/clear), I believe that the 
proposal must immediately terminate web apps if all changes between 
begin/end could not be applied.  Otherwise the UA has the non-option of 
either exposing non-atomic or inconsistent changes to localStorage, or 
allowing side-effecty script statements to complete in between attempted 
modifications to localStorage that fail.  Other proposals explicitly 
*allow* scripts to be notified of failures, with the intention that a 
script could retry failed modifications.  One use for such an API is a 
localStorage implementation with optimistic transactions, i.e. 
transactions implemented with STM-like techniques (which is what I had 
in mind with the OP).

(For the latter, Rob O'Callahan proposed a very interesting 
&quot;localStorage developer/debug mode&quot; in which the UA would always fail a 
transaction at least once before succeeding.  This would allow authors 
to ensure that they uniformly handled failed transactions.  This could 
even be exposed as localStorage.__debug__ or somesuch rather than 
through UA-specific preferences.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those who want pessimistic transactions.  I.e. using locking so that you 
</I>&gt;<i> never need to do a rollback (because it can never &quot;fail&quot;).  This would 
</I>&gt;<i> be compatible with either a sync or an async interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
By the above characterization: { uniform granularity of ACID 
(traditional transactions), async/sync unspecified, unobservable 
transaction failures }.

&gt;<i> Those who optimistic transactions.  I.e. rollback may happen.  Either we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to restrict what can be done during a localStorage transaction or 
</I>&gt;<i> we need to have an exception that tells the script to undo itself.  This 
</I>&gt;<i> was the original proposal, AFAICT.  It would work with both a sync or an 
</I>&gt;<i> async interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
{ Traditional transactions, sync/async unspecified, observable 
transaction failures }.

I should note that I'm now of the opinion that { traditional 
transactions, async, observable transaction failures } is the way to go.

&gt;<i> Those who want a queue.  I.e. those who want an asynchronous callback 
</I>&gt;<i> based interface and the UA will only call one callback at a time. 
</I>&gt;<i>  Perhaps on a per-origin basis.  Note that this can never &quot;fail&quot;, need 
</I>&gt;<i> to be rolled back, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This sounds to me like { traditional transactions, async, unobservable 
transaction failures } which is the same as your first camp above except 
async only.  Or are you proposing that the unit of atomicity/consistency 
is not all operations performed in the callback; i.e., that 
modifications done in the callback can be partially applied?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe Aaron is in the queue camp with me.  I'm becoming more and 
</I>&gt;<i> more convinced that Chromium should/will not implement the storage mutex 
</I>&gt;<i> at all (even for LocalStorage) unless we can come up with a way for 
</I>&gt;<i> event loops to not be blocked.  And, as far as I can tell, Async 
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces are the only way to accomplish this.
</I>
In general, agreed.  I still believe that a sync API with exposed 
transaction failures (as I proposed in the OP) and the right 
implementation could do quite well.  But I now think that an async 
version of that same API could perform even better.  In addition, that 
API is most flexible in terms of possible UA implementations.

IOW, I think that { traditional transactions, async, observable failures 
} subsumes both { traditional transactions, sync, observable failures } 
(OP's proposal) *and* { traditional transactions, async, unobservable 
failures } (your and Aaron's proposal).


IMHO there are two remaining questions: first, whether the &quot;ideal&quot; 
localStorage transactional API should allow observable transaction 
failures.  I believe that it should, as this allows for the widest 
variety of efficient implementations without changing ACID (best effort) 
guarantees given to authors or significantly complicating the 
localStorage API.

Second, what is the best way to go forward with transactional 
localStorage while remaining backwards-compatible with current 
implementations.  One option would be to deprecate localStorage in favor 
of a future, transactional window.domainStorage or somesuch.

Another, probably better, option is Maciej's proposal, a two-headed 
localStorage.  The non-transactional localStorage would be deprecated 
and remain spec'd as today { single-modification AC/storage-mutex 
I/undefined D, sync, some observable failures }.  In addition, for cases 
like &quot;clear private data&quot;, UAs would be allowed to silently break 
storage-mutex isolation for apps using the non-transactional API.

Cheers,
Chris
