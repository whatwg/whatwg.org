Ah, ok. Yes, per spec display:none doesn't affect this.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As far as text/plain goes, the current spec text means that if I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have a PostScript file that includes some &quot;binary&quot; bytes in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; first 512 bytes and my web server sends text/plain for it and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;object&gt; has a type attribute with the value &quot;text/plain&quot; then the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; data will be treated as application/postscript.  That doesn't seem 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; desirable to me.  Is it intentional?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. This is the same as happens if you navigate straight to such a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file, as far as I can tell. Why would we not want that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One difference is that in this case in addition to the text/plain 
</I>&gt;<i> content-type header (which we know is untrustworthy) there is also an 
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-band @type attribute saying text/plain, which presumably 
</I>&gt;<i> represents the author's wishes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the whole point of text/plain sniffing is a workaround around a 
</I>&gt;<i> known issue where content is reliably mis-marked as text/plain, and 
</I>&gt;<i> since in this case there is a source of MIME information that's more 
</I>&gt;<i> reliable than that, it's not clear to me why we want to continue 
</I>&gt;<i> sniffing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if there is no @type there is no problem; I'm specifically 
</I>&gt;<i> concerned about the @type=&quot;text/plain&quot; case here.
</I>
What exactly are you proposing here?

 - Always honour type=&quot;&quot; if it's a UA-supported type, ignoring server- 
   provided content-type?
 - Always honour type=&quot;&quot; without sniffing if it matches the server- 
   provided content-type, even if normally that type would be sniffed?
 - Just honour type=&quot;text/plain&quot; regardless of the server type, but for
   other UA-supported type=&quot;&quot;s, use the server type?


&gt;<i> My concern about text/plain data being sniffed as text/html by your 
</I>&gt;<i> current algorithm (even with the changes you've made) seems to remain 
</I>&gt;<i> unaddressed.
</I>
I thought I had. Can you walk me through how anything labeled text/plain 
could get sniffed as text/html with the new text?


&gt;<i> That's a critical issue, no?
</I>
Yes.
