</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Open a SharedWorker and send a MessagePort to the other window.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unless there's a reason to prevent free communication between windows,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there must be a better solution. I can think of a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibilities. The most obvious one would be an API similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; postMessage that allows broadcasting of messages to all windows, windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by name, and windows by domain. Another one (which I haven't developed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very far) would be to stick with window.postMessage but provide an API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to ask for windows. So, I could say, &quot;Can I please have a reference to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the window named 'x'&quot;, or, &quot;...to windows at 'example.com'&quot;, or, &quot;...to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any window who'll give me one&quot;. Each window would obviously have to opt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you all think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you know there's a Window to get a hold of if you don't have a hold
</I>&gt;<i> of it already?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main reason for Window.postMessage() is communication with iframes
</I>&gt;<i> (gadgets), not with other top-level browsing contexts. What's the use case
</I>&gt;<i> for the latter?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I assume the use case for this is similar with the use case for storage
events which essentially is a broadcast mechanism that's specific to just
DOM storage.  So if, for example, you wanted to tell your other windows
&quot;hey!  I changed the cookie&quot; then you could do it with a message.  This
seems much better than, for example polling.

This could also be useful if you wanted to say &quot;hey, I just navigated to
gmail.com.  Do any of you already have the inbox and chat contacts loaded
up?&quot;.  I suppose there's not much advantage to doing it like this over
shared workers since either way you're passing messages, but I also don't
see any major downsides to allowing broadcasts.
