Despite localStorage unfortunate locking contention problem, it's
become quite a popular API. It's also very successful in terms of
browser deployment since it's available in at least latest versions of
IE, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. Don't know about support in Opera?

Browser UI jank isn't a problem as far as I can tell though. In
multi-process browsers the browser UI generally runs in a process
separate from the web page and so is not affected by the lock. In
single process browsers no lock is needed as there aren't multiple
processes that can access the localStorage at the same time.

Any time you store data into localStorage it seems useful to store
structured data. Say for example an webmail implementation storing
emails in each localStorage entry, in this case it would be possible
to store email body, from, to, date, flags, etc in a structured way.

Another reason is the ability to store file objects. This is something
that's important in order to be able to implement for example offline
email with attachments.

Note that while storing File objects is supported, you don't actually
need to store the data in it synchronously. Instead you can
asynchronously stream the filedata anyplace, and simply store a
pointer in the localStorage to that location.
