</I>&gt;<i> This is a good question.  Most of the use cases I can imagine boil down to
</I>&gt;<i> a master/slave division of labor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, if I write an app that does some batch asynchronous processing

</I>&gt;<i> entire job, so that other instances of my app know not to start another such

</I>&gt;<i> storage is modified at each step such that guaranteeing storage consistency
</I>&gt;<i> within the scope of script evaluation is not enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Darin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Also, the other motivating factor for me is access to LocalStorage from
workers.  (I know it has been removed from the spec, but that is
unfortunate, no?)

By definition, workers are designed to be long lived, possibly doing long
stretches of computation, and being able to intermix reads and writes to
storage during that stretch of computation would be nice.

Moreover, it would be nice if a worker in domain A could effectively &quot;lock&quot;
part of the storage so that the portion of the app running on the main
thread could continue accessing the other parts of storage associated with
domain A.  The implicit storage mutex doesn't support this use case very
well.  You end up having to call the getStorageUpdates function periodically
(releasing the lock in the middle of computation!!).  That kind of thing is
really scary and hard to get right.  I cringe whenever I see someone
unlocking, calling out to foreign code, and then re-acquiring the lock.
 Why?  because it means that existing variables, stack based or otherwise,
that were previously consistent may have become inconsistent with global
data in storage due to having released the lock.  getStorageUpdates is
dangerous.  it is a big hammer that doesn't really fit the bill.

The alternative to getStorageUpdates in this case is to create another
domain on which to run the background worker just so that you can have an
independent slice of storage.  That seems really lame to me.  Why should
domain A have to jump through such hoops?
