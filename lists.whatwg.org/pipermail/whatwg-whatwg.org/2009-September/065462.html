To give a data point I can tell you all about my PhD thesis work that
involves localStorage. Basically I am looking at how to automate the
persistence of JavaScript data objects (i.e. stuff JSON supports) both
locally for performance/offline reasons, and to the cloud for
synchronization/backup reasons. For the browser side I am using
localStorage to store the objects.

I have ended up using localStorage by using keys that represent
&quot;pointers&quot; for objects with the values being the JSON string for that
object. This essentially lets me treat localStorage as an object
store. With some other JavaScript trickery I am able to load only the
objects I need and avoid loading the rest of the object graph,
avoiding performance costs when trying to stringify a large object
graph at once.

Talking directly to the structured clones direction, I have to say
that I personally would rather have it revert back to strings. With my
persistence hat on I would say it would be a slight convenience, but
with my localStorage-browser-compatibility-library hat on I would say
that it is going to be a huge pain in the rear to add support for the
browsers already out there for minor benefit.

So if I can build an automated data object persistence object on top
of localStorage as it is implemented in the browsers today (sans
incompatibilities) then I think your assessment, Jeremy, is true that
localStorage can be used as the storage basis for things, and w/o
structured clones to boot.
