I mostly agree with that.  I like the idea of storage mutex 
conceptually, but I think it could end up hurting the Web as much as it 
helps.  For multi-event-loop UAs, |x = window.localStorage.getItem('x')| 
is an innocent-looking operation with global (browser-wide) 
consequences, and web devs will need to be mindful of those consequences.

&gt;<i> Part of me thinks that this API should match the WebDatabase API more. 
</I>&gt;<i>  For example, you'd call a function with a callback.  That callback 
</I>&gt;<i> would be given the localStorage object which it'd use to 
</I>&gt;<i> do manipulations.  Etc.  But part of me like what you're suggesting 
</I>&gt;<i> here.  I actually think the idea of throwing an exception whenever 
</I>&gt;<i> there's a serialization problem could be very compelling, and could keep 
</I>&gt;<i> the door wide open for future performance enhancements.  It's even 
</I>&gt;<i> possible that javascript engines could embed elements of software 
</I>&gt;<i> transactional memory in the future to eliminate the need to make such 
</I>&gt;<i> calls.  That seems really exciting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I> &gt; It might also be possible to combine the 2 ideas: you call a function
 &gt; with your callback and the callback is given a localStorage object which
 &gt; is only valid within the callback, but an exception can be thrown when
 &gt; there's a problem with the transaction.  Of course, the benefit to
 &gt; explicitly starting and ending a transaction is that it can span
 &gt; setTimeouts, event handlers, etc.  On the other hand, I wonder if the
 &gt; cases where an app would do this and still be able to recover from a
 &gt; transaction failure would be limited.
 &gt;

I would be satisfied with a callback API, even an async one.  If we were 
to go forward with transactional localStorage, I think the main API 
design decision would be whether or not to &quot;hide&quot; transactions from 
authors.  Obviously hiding them would be desirable, but unlike 
WebDatabase, localStorage can't easily import SQL semantics.  If we were 
to hide them,  I think we should offer a StorageTransaction object 
describing the operations to be performed on the DB, and offer the 
function localStorage.executeTransaction(txnObject).  In this way we 
could avoid the side-effecty problems of generic scripts accessing 
localStorage.

But personally, I prefer exposed transactions.  A transaction might 
contain data dependencies --- for example, x = getItem('x'), x += 1, 
setItem('x', x).  It seems to me very hard to capture this in an API 
that hides transactions from the user while at the same time not turning 
into a scripting language unto itself (or providing a strongly 
restricted scripting environment in a &quot;transaction callback&quot;).

&gt;<i> Another thing we might want to consider is making transactions optional. 
</I>&gt;<i>  This would satisfy group 1 and 2, but would put the group 3 you 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned at more risk.  In other words, not calling beginTransaction 
</I>&gt;<i> would not be fatal.  It would just mean localStorage works as currently 
</I>&gt;<i> spec'ed.  But, doing it within a transaction (be it a callback or within 
</I>&gt;<i> ___Transaction calls) would give you additional guarantees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I would really prefer to not do that.  Can any web devs using 
localStorage comment on how they detect whether browsers support that 
feature?  If the test is something like 
|<i>window.hasProperty('localStorage')|, then I would prefer to make this 
</I>return |false| until |window.beginTransaction| was accessed.

Cheers,
Chris
