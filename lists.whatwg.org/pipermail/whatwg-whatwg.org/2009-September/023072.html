<PRE>These two statements are true...
* &quot;We can't change the API&quot;
* It is seriously flawed
... and therein lies the problem.

I'm sad to have to say it... but I hope this withers and dies an early
death. Putting this in the web platform for perpetuity is a mistake. I don't
support the adoption of this into the platform.

Time to go read the SimpleDatabase proposal.

You must not have read Darin's proposal. It wasn't a 'lock' at all. It's a
completely async, well-factored primitive.
  void acqureFlag('name', callback);   // returns immediately in all cases
  void releaseFlag('name');  // returns immediately in all cases
The callback is called upon 'flag' acquisition. Its all yours until you call
release. Completely async. I think its self-evident that this can be
composed with a SharedWorker.

Darin's was an example of a good proposal... simple on all dimensions, yet
powerful and broadly applicable... what is not to like? Marry the 'flag'
with a unlocked storage repository and viola, you have something... the
whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

Another lesson to be learned from the LocalStorage debacle is to decompose
things, hashmaps+(implicit)locks+events... it slices and dices (and there's
more)... it was a bad idea to jumble all that together... individually,
minus the implicit, those would make for nice features.

Also, regarding &quot;we can't change the API&quot;... well it did get changed... the
application of additional implicit locking semantics to IE's API... that is
a material change.
