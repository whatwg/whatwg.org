Sure.  But what about the other idea Robert and Drew had (in the workers +
local storage thread) about just having a WorkerLocalStorage mechanism?
 Only workers would be able to access it and the interface would be exactly
the same as LocalStorage.  The only difference is that the data is in
a separate area (and pages/workers cannot share data).  (Though we could, in
the future, add such an async interface if we wanted to allow pages to
access it.)  I know the burden for implementation in WebKit is low, and I
imagine (though don't know for sure) that the burden would be low in other
browsers as well.
