I guess I should have said &quot;mutex&quot; (in quotes) because something like this
is what I intended.

Not that it matters to the spec, but this is more or less how I'm
implementing locking within Chromium.  The only difference is that the queue
is of renderer processes (blocked on getting the lock) rather than
individual callbacks.  Doing the latter would be nice since sometimes web
pages have to share the same process (and thus one origin may block another
from executing because of Chromium implementational details).

&gt;<i> An optimized implementation could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wait until the first operation that can't be un-done before acquiring it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and do everything optimistically until then.  This is the same situation
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WebDatabase if I understand it correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can't do this because upgrading the lock could block the UI
</I>&gt;<i> thread. Same thing with the database spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure you could block the UI thread more, but there's nothing to stop you
from doing a 'while (true) { }' inside the callback, which will block the UI
thread as well.  So I disagree with your assertion that waiting for a lock
upgrade is a deal breaker.  I don't think any implementation is
realistically going to do anything like this in the near term, though.

If you want to get fancy, the transaction() method can take a
&gt;<i> read/write param. This is what the database spec does, but I think it
</I>&gt;<i> is overkill here, personally.
</I>

Agreed.

I thought it over, but I can't come up with any deadlock scenario.  I would
still be a bit worried about performance issues (including many ways a
developer could shoot themself in the foot), but it is an interesting idea.


&gt;<i> I know that setting document.domain makes this tricky because it
</I>&gt;<i> synchronously enables new cross-domain interactions, but can't we handle
</I>&gt;<i> that by declaring that setting document.domain releases the storage mutex?
</I>

I think this would be very reasonable.  Especially with all the other things
that already implicitly drop the lock.
