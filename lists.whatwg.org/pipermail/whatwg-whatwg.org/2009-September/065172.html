</I>
It's only useful for IM apps to know that the user is present but not
paying attention to them because they typically have the ability to
obtain the user's attention somehow -- e.g., by popping up a window or
causing something on the task bar to flash.  As far as I know, web
apps have no way to get the user's attention if they aren't using the
web app, do they?  I'd imagine popping up a window isn't reliable --
it might be stopped by a popup blocker, or the user might have all new
windows going to tabs, or something like that.  (Is there a new API
for that, perhaps?)

&gt;<i> I'm fine with those statements as long as you append &quot;...on our specific
</I>&gt;<i> platform&quot; to each one. In the general case, however, especially on
</I>&gt;<i> non-mobile platforms, they aren't true at all. In particular, the solution

</I>&gt;<i> protocols, i.e. no detectable user interaction with the computer as a whole.
</I>
I agree with this.  If some platforms don't let applications run in
the background, I don't see why that should prevent the creation of an
idle detection API.  It just wouldn't really work on those platforms,
like a lot of other web app functionality (like checking for new mail
in the background).  The WHATWG is mainly trying to support rich
applications for desktops or near-desktops, not a
lowest-common-denominator feature set that will work even on minimal
devices.
