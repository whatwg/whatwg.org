I don't think it's hard to implement, even implementing it without 
literally using a global mutex.  I just don't think it solves the 
problem of guaranteeing cross-tab data integrity for poorly written 
sites.  And if the intention is to make scripts appear to run 
atomically, then I think there are better ways to specify that than 
storage mutex.

My problem with storage mutex boils down to the fact that by the letter 
of the spec, a script can lock out the UA indefinitely by just reading a 
cookie.  Obviously we're going to have to break that in some situations. 
  So if that's the case, why present that abstraction to scripts? 
Transactional semantics seems to be a better abstraction, and an 
ancillary benefit is that it's much easier to implement to boot.  Though 
even if it were harder to implement, I would still argue for it.

Cheers,
Chris

&gt;<i>     This is especially true if the storage mutex extends to cookies
