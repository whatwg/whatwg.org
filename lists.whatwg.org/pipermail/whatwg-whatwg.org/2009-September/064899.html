Indeed.

Flash's privacy problem can be removed by uninstalling Flash. They're not 
a license to add more privacy problems to the platform.

The latter.

</I>
If Adobe wants to violate their users' privacy, that's their prerogative. 
But I'm not speccing something that so blatently allows users to be 
tracked without their consent -- and worse -- despite their attempts to 
stop it.
