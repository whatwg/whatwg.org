That's possible; I would recommend taking up a Global Script proposal in 
the public-webapps working group, though, as it is more of a Web App API 
type of thing than an HTML5 core feature.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This feature is of minimal use if there are multiple global objects

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate global object, we really haven't solved the problem this is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setting out to solve. We can already get a hold of the Window objects 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of subwindows (e.g. for popping out a chat window), which effectively 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provides a global object for those cases, so it's only an interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal if we can guarantee global objects to more than just those.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What problem do you think this is trying to solve? I think you're 
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding the motivation. The motivation is frame/page navigation 
</I>&gt;<i> performance once an app is up and running.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, we can't. Given that all frames in a browsing context have to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be on the same thread, regardless of domain, then unless we put all 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the browsing contexts on the same thread, we can't guarantee that all 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frames from the same domain across all browsing contexts will be on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same thread.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As proposed, there is nothing that forces things into a single thread. 
</I>&gt;<i> Those contexts that happen to be on the same thread can benefit from the 
</I>&gt;<i> feature.
</I>
We already have a single global object today, in the world where 
independent windows end up with different &quot;global script&quot; objects. It's 
the Window object of the opener.


&gt;<i> &gt; I know that some consider the asynchronous interaction with workers to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a blocker problem, but I don't really understand why. We already 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to have asynchronous communication with the server, which holds 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the roster data structure, and so on. What difference does it make if 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of talking to the server, you talk to a worker?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Provided you can talk to the 'shared worker' in the same fashion you can 
</I>&gt;<i> talk to the server (XHR)... you have a point here when it comes to 
</I>&gt;<i> keeping application 'state' in memory and quickly retrieving it from any 
</I>&gt;<i> page in the application. But, using a worker does nothing to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> application 'code' required to run in pages 'hot'... code that does HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> DOM manipulation for example can't run in the worker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can't rely on opener since it can be closed at any time... including 
</I>&gt;<i> prior to the openee being loaded.
</I>
It won't get garbage-collected though, so if it's closed, just grab the 
&quot;hot&quot; stuff you want over to a new &quot;master&quot; window.


&gt;<i> Maybe a better approach would be to make frame navigations not so 
</I>&gt;<i> costly.
</I>
That's up to browser vendors.


&gt;<i> Does that mean you won't help produce a draft spec of this for us to 
</I>&gt;<i> work with?
</I>
I think it's a bad idea, so no. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> - The async model isn't really that tough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the first, I would argue that the web should progress much like

</I>&gt;<i> by putting different apps on different cores, not by requiring each
</I>&gt;<i> application view to run in its own thread.
</I>
That's fine today, but it won't do us much good when we have orders of 
magnitude more cores than running applications.


&gt;<i> Finally, I don't think the UI can ever be a simple shim. There's a
</I>&gt;<i> long list of things that have to be in the UI: complex widget
</I>&gt;<i> rendering
</I>
...should be in the browser, not the Web app.


&gt;<i> UI effects
</I>
...should be in the CSS, not the script.


&gt;<i> event handling
</I>
That's pretty much all that should be in the UI-thread script, and it 
should just defer to the workers.

Aren't global script objects supposed to be client-side? I don't see how 
they would help with server-side state.
