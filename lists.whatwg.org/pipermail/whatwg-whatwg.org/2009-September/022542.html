Does the silence mean that no one has any intention of implementing this?
 If so, maybe we should resign ourselves to a break in the single threaded
illusion for cookies.  This doesn't seem too outlandish considering that web
servers working with cookies will never have such a guarantee and given that
we have no evidence of widespread breakage with IE 8 and Chrome.

If we were to get rid of the storage mutex for cookie manipulation (as I
believe we should) maybe we should re-examine it for local storage.  At a
minimum, it could be implemented as a per-origin mutex.  But I feel strongly
we should go further.  Why not have an asynchronous mechanism for atomic
updates?  For example, if I wanted to write an ATM application, I would have
to do the following:

var accountDelta = /* something */;
window.localStorage.executeAtomic(function() {
    localStorage.accountBalance = localStorage.accountBalance +
accountDelta;
}

Alternatively, we could make it so that each statement is atomic, but that
you have to use such a mechanism for anything more complicated. For example:

localStorage.accountBalance = localStorage.accountBalance + accountDelta;
 // It's atomic, so no worries!
var balance = localStorage.accountBalance;  /* Oh no!!!!  This isn't safe
since it's implemented via multiple statements... */
localStorage.accountBalance = balance + accountDelta;  /* ....we should have
used localStorage.executeAtomic! */

Such ideas would definitely lighten lock contention and possibly eliminate
the need for yieldForStorageUpdates (formerly getStorageUpdates).  Another
major bonus is that it'd allow us to expose localStorage to workers again,
which is one of the top complaints I've gotten when talking to web
developers about localStorage.

I know this is radical stuff, but the way things are speced currently just
are not practical.
