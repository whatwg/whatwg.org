</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is being referred to in a lot of cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which of the above is unclear?
</I>
By this point I've totally forgotten how I was interpreting the text
when I first read it, but I know I was confused.

&gt;<i> Ah. I think I'd rather stick to the explicit terms instead of adding more!
</I>
Right, I didn't mean to suggest you should add more.

&gt;<i> Nothing is to be read between the lines -- unless it says that something
</I>&gt;<i> can be changed, the default assumption is that it can't be changed. (There
</I>&gt;<i> are a finite number of things that can be changed, and an infinite number
</I>&gt;<i> that cannot, so it doesn't make sense to do it the other way around.)
</I>
The wording &quot;Unless otherwise specified&quot; makes it sound like it's not
otherwise specified, though, or at least it's noncommittal about
whether it's otherwise specified.  It would be clearer (and marginally
shorter) if it said &quot;The user agent should not allow the user to
modify the element's value or checkedness except as specified&quot;, thus
making it clear that it *is* specified.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The difference is stylistic. Compare the two in Safari.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think more informative notes about the purpose of things like this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would make the spec a lot easier to comprehend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Added a note about this.
</I>
Great.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In 4.10.4.1.7:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;If the element is mutable, the user agent should allow the user to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; change the global date and time represented by its value, as obtained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; by parsing a global date and time from it. User agents must not allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the user to set the value to a string that is not a valid global date
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and time string expressed in UTC, though user agents may allow the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; user to set and view the time in another time zone and silently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; translate the time to and from the UTC time zone in the value. If the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; user agent provides a user interface for selecting a global date and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; time, then the value must be set to a valid global date and time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; string expressed in UTC representing the user's selection. User
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; agents should allow the user to set the value to the empty string.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This paragraph looks repetitive to me. &#160;I think the third sentence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; can just be dropped, unless I'm missing something -- does it add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; anything?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This paragraph is setting out precisely what the requirements are for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; user agents. The four sentences each cover a slightly different aspect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of the requirements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; They don't seem to overlap at all -- the first says that the UI needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to allow changes, the second that if the user can set the value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; directly, the UA needs to prevent invalid values from being set, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; third says that if the UA allows the user to set the value using some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; sort of UI, that the UI should convert the value to one of those valid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; things, and the fourth one says that in addition, the UA can allow the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; user to reset the value to nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I'm reading it, the first two sentences imply the third. &#160;The user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must be allowed to change it, but not to invalid values; so obviously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any input mechanism that's provided must only allow valid values to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input. &#160;What incorrect behavior does the third sentence rule out, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rest of the spec would permit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The third sentence isn't ruling out anything, it's requiring specifically
</I>&gt;<i> that if the user agent offers a UI, say a clock, that the user agent set
</I>&gt;<i> the value to a value that matches what the user selected, so that, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, setting the value to 4 o'clock when the user picked 2 o'clock
</I>&gt;<i> would be non-conforming.
</I>
Then the only significant part of the sentence is &quot;representing the
user's selection&quot;, and &quot;a valid global date and time string expressed
in UTC&quot; is in fact redundant to the second sentence?  You could
replace it with &quot;a date and time string&quot; or such, to make it clear
that the sentence adds no additional requirement of validity beyond
what the second sentence imposes.

I really think it's self-evident that the user agent has to set the
date and time to one corresponding to what the user actually selected,
though.  I know you like to be explicit, but . . .

&gt;<i> There are any number of possible ways of doing autocomplete that aren't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily worse than &lt;datalist&gt;, depending on what you want to do.
</I>
Like what?

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;readonly&quot; means that the value should be selectable for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; copy-and-paste (thus it makes no sense for buttons and other non-text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; controls to be readonly), while &quot;disabled&quot; means that the control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; should not be responsive to user interaction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; These conventions are common to most GUI systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this behavior specified anywhere? &#160;If not, it seems like it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be, even if some subset of readers would be expected to guess it from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> familiarity with the conventions of GUI systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The spec does say that disabled controls aren't focusable. I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> what else it can say.
</I>
I'm not sure either, I guess.

&gt;&gt;<i> Assuming both are kept, this is another case where a brief informative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> note would be helpful -- it's logical to expect that new features add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something new, and if you can't spot the difference you're left
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncertain as to whether there is any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where would you put the note?
</I>
Probably near the top of &quot;The button element&quot;, since that's later in
the spec than input elements.
