<PRE>In general, I agree with Rob about this proposal.  What problem with 
storage mutex as spec'd today does your proposal solve?

I'm eagerly willing to concede explicit 
beginTransaction()/commitTransaction() for a window.transaction() 
wrapper that implicitly does those.

No, transactions can still fail.  They can fail in ways immediately 
hidden from the script that requested them if the UA has to interrupt 
the conceptually executing transaction in the ways enumerated in a 
separate branch of this thread.  Later script executions can observe 
inconsistent state unless more is specified by your proposal.

Transactions can also fail visibly if write-to-disk fails (probably also 
in other ways I haven't considered).  It's not clear what should happen 
wrt to your proposal in this case.

(We could pretend that these failures never occur, but IMHO my original 
proposal handles both naturally.)

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I have to admit that I didn't closely read the Web Database spec before 
making the OP.  Like Rob, my scan of the text led me to believe that it 
provided an API to asynchronously execute SQL free from script side 
effects.  It does *not*.  Arbitrary side-effecty script statements can 
execute within Web Database transactions.  And these transactions can be 
synchronous.  And like my OP concerning localStorage, Web Database 
transactions are allowed to fail by the spec.

In fact, I believe that the &quot;Synchronous database API&quot; describes the 
same transaction semantics as I proposed in the OP.  That spec adds 
implicit begin/commitTransaction and read-only transactions, but 
otherwise the semantics are the same.

So I'd like to amend my original proposal to be

   Use Synchronous Web Database API transaction semantics.  Except do 
not offer readTransaction: a transaction is implicitly a read-only 
transaction if only getItem() is called on localStorage from within 
localStorage.transaction().

SELUAs (single-event-loop UAs) can implement this semantics without 
mutexes.  MELUAs (multi-event-loop UAs) can implement this semantics 
with mutexes, but more interesting and performant non-blocking 
implementations also seem possible (which is what I had in mind with the 
OP.)

Cheers,
Chris
