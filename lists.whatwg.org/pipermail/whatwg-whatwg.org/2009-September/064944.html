<PRE>For the record, I'm perfectly happy with WebSockets not being made any more
complicated for v1 (i.e. no multi-plexing), but I don't think your arguments
against it are compelling at all, so I'm going to play devils advocate:

Latency and limits within the OS.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You could have it be an optional feature.  Most websites are hosted through
just a couple servers like how most websites are viewed in just a couple
browsers.  Its not like every web developer would have to implement their
own server.  I don't understand why you think this server side argument is
so compelling

&gt;<i> 3. Scripts in different tabs, and even from different sites, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connect to the same server would be able to share TCP/IP channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do we really want two different pages sharing the same TCP connection?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Once again yes, for latency reasons.


&gt;<i> That seems like a disaster waiting to happen -- it just takes one minor
</I>&gt;<i> bug on the server for information to end up in the wrong channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You could say the same thing about so many parts of the networking stack.
 An off by one error here or there could easily mis-route a message to the
wrong app/router/etc.  But they generally don't.  When there are worries
about correctness, you make test suites.  I really don't understand why you
think this is so risky.


&gt;<i> Seems reasonable, though I am skeptical about throwing this level of
</I>&gt;<i> complexity at Web authors, and I don't really know how we would expose it
</I>&gt;<i> at the API level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why is this necessary?  It seems like when you open multiple WebSocket
connections to the same server, they could transparently share the same
connection.
