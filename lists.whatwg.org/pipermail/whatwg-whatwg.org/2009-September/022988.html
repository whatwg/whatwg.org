SOP?


&gt;<i> &gt; How do you know there's a Window to get a hold of if you don't have a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hold of it already?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't. What's common among the use cases for this kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> inter-window communication is that you are trying to talk to windows 
</I>&gt;<i> which may have been around longer than you or were created after you. If 
</I>&gt;<i> the call fails or you get no response, handle it (tell the user, open 
</I>&gt;<i> the window, or do nothing.).
</I>
Seems like a shared worker is the best way to do that, since that way you 
don't have to worry about a master election each time one of the windows 
you're talking to closes.


&gt;<i> &gt; The main reason for Window.postMessage() is communication with iframes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (gadgets), not with other top-level browsing contexts. What's the use case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the latter?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I assume the use case for this is similar with the use case for storage

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DOM storage. &#160;So if, for example, you wanted to tell your other windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;hey! &#160;I changed the cookie&quot; then you could do it with a message. &#160;This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems much better than, for example polling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This could also be useful if you wanted to say &quot;hey, I just navigated to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gmail.com. &#160;Do any of you already have the inbox and chat contacts loaded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up?&quot;. &#160;I suppose there's not much advantage to doing it like this over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shared workers since either way you're passing messages, but I also don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see any major downsides to allowing broadcasts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The original case that made me start exploring these APIs was a &quot;stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> browser&quot; that I'm working on (think address book). The browser stays 
</I>&gt;<i> open (as a popup) and can be used alone, but other pages should be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to ask it to navigate to a specific record. A shared worker would 
</I>&gt;<i> actually work quite nicely in this situation, but wouldn't work at all 
</I>&gt;<i> across-domains.
</I>
That's an interesting use case.

(You can work around the current limitation of shared workers being 
same-domain only by having an iframe to proxy the request to talk to the 
shared worker, and then getting it to post you back a pipe to the worker. 
Not hugely elegant, but it'll work for now.)


&gt;<i> For instance, websites are big these days on asking for login
</I>&gt;<i> information for webmail clients to pull down contacts. What if an
</I>&gt;<i> informal protocol were developed for exchanging contact information?
</I>&gt;<i> Then, let's say I'm on Google Voice and want to call a number from my
</I>&gt;<i> address book (which may be run by an unrelated company). Google Voice
</I>&gt;<i> checks to see if I have a window open that identifies itself as an
</I>&gt;<i> address book, sends it a MessagePort, and displays an &quot;add from
</I>&gt;<i> address book&quot; button next to the phone number field. When I click the
</I>&gt;<i> button, the address book's UI changes to indicate that it's ready for
</I>&gt;<i> me to pick a phone number to send back to Google Voice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same concept could apply to a password manager. An informal
</I>&gt;<i> protocol would let login pages broadcast their existence to other
</I>&gt;<i> windows and and if the user happens to have a web-based password
</I>&gt;<i> manager open, it could answer the request and send back credentials.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not great at coming up with use cases, but messaging between
</I>&gt;<i> separate top-level browsing contexts with different origins isn't
</I>&gt;<i> covered by the current APIs, and it's a broad enough category that
</I>&gt;<i> more-creative developers will want it once they realize that message
</I>&gt;<i> passing exists at all.
</I>
I think the experience would be better using a shared worker for this, to 
be honest. You don't want to have to pop up a new window if the user 
doesn't yet have one for the contacts window, or something like that.
