Is it?  Can you provide some use cases?  :-)

As I stated, my conversations with developers led me to believe having
access to storage within workers is most important and that having shared
memory between pages and workers would make things easier on some of them.
 In other words, from my talks, it's a secondary goal.

</I>
Well, doing just a sync interface is &quot;MUCH simpler&quot;, but I suppose there's
no reason not to add both to the spec.  To be clear, though, adding the sync
interface to workers would be a much higher priority for me than the async
interface.  Enough so that there's a chance we'd ship a version of Chrome
that did not yet implement the async interface.  That seems OK to me,
though.

</I>&gt;<i> multiple-differently-named storage area does add additional
</I>&gt;<i> complexity, and maybe we should defer that to something like the
</I>&gt;<i> WebSimpleStorage spec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I certainly agree that having some shared memory format between workers
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages would be good, and there's some use cases which would

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aspects were more nice to have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would the specifics of a worker-only storage be? Can multiple

</I>&gt;<i> by a mutex). Is there one storage per worker URL? Or do all workers
</I>&gt;<i> from a particular domain share the same workerStorage?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also wondering what the use-cases for a worker-only storage is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The use cases all revolve around having a backend in a worker that handles
offline and/or caching.  It could either feed its data to the page via
messages or shared memory.  The former requires at least worker-only and the
latter requires storage shared between the worker and the page.  The latter
is technically an optimization, but I agree that it's a fairly major one.
