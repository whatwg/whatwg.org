</I>&gt;<i>

The authors still have to implement it on the server side, though.

</I>
The website authors still have to do it even if the UA is the one that 
codes it up on the client side.


&gt;<i> 3. Scripts in different tabs, and even from different sites, that
</I>&gt;<i> connect to the same server would be able to share TCP/IP channel.
</I>
Do we really want two different pages sharing the same TCP connection? 
That seems like a disaster waiting to happen -- it just takes one minor 
bug on the server for information to end up in the wrong channel.

(Multiple tabs can be done with a shared worker.)


&gt;<i> 4. If websocket is successful, websocket proxies will likely show up, 
</I>&gt;<i> allowing multiplexing across different users that share the same proxy.
</I>
That sounds frightening.


&gt;<i> Looking at how much HTTP benefits from &quot;multiplexing&quot; in the form of 
</I>&gt;<i> connection: keep-alive, and how much more it would have benefitted from 
</I>&gt;<i> good multiplexing in the form of pipelineing, I'd be very surprised if 
</I>&gt;<i> websocket wouldn't benefit from it as well.
</I>
I agree entirely that we shouldn't keep creating and tearing down 
connections, but Web Sockets are long-lived, so multiplexing doesn't 
really save much on that front. HTTP has a very different interaction 
model than Web Sockets. HTTP wouldn't benefit anywhere near as much from 
true multiplexing as it does from just simple pipelining.


&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that it could be useful for bigger packets; maybe when we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support binary frames we should say that the frames are compressed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I'm not sure all binary frames needs to be compressed. For example 
</I>&gt;<i> transmitting a jpeg over websocket should be done in a binary frame, but 
</I>&gt;<i> would unlikely benefit from being compressed. One possible solution is 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the 0x80 frame type as a raw binary frame, 0x81 is a compressed 
</I>&gt;<i> frame, with the following contents:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> frame-type
</I>&gt;<i> name-of-encoding
</I>&gt;<i> 00
</I>&gt;<i> encoded-contents
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> frame-type is a single byte indicating which frame-type is encoded.
</I>&gt;<i> name-of-encoding is a US-ASCII encoded string indicating the name of
</I>&gt;<i> the encoding, this could be 'gzip' for gzipped compression, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 00 is the single byte with value 0
</I>&gt;<i> encoded-contents is the actual contents, ending at the end of the frame.
</I>
Seems reasonable, though I am skeptical about throwing this level of 
complexity at Web authors, and I don't really know how we would expose it 
at the API level.

Something to look at in a future version, though.
