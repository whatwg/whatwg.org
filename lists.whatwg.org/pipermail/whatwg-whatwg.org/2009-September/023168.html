Actually, this seems like a prime reason *to* add structured storage
support. Obviously string data wasn't enough for you so you had to
write extra code in order to work around that. If structured clones
had been natively supported you both would have had to write less
code, and the resulting algorithms would have been faster. Faster
since the browser can serialize/parser to/from a binary internal
format faster than to/from JSON through the JSON serializer/parser.
