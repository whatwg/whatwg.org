Thanks for this.

&gt;&gt;<i> Know any sites that'd break or begin to unexpectedly load a bunch of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure, but since as far as I now Opera and IE both keep the plug-in

</I>&gt;<i> Want to test?
</I>
Attaching a test.

Results:

O.K., if the initial display state of the &lt;object&gt; is none, then Opera,  
Firefox, Safari and IE don't load the plug-in.

Then, once you set the display to inline, inline-block, block or table for  
example, the &lt;object&gt; will display and fire up the plugin.

Then:

In Opera:

If you switch the display to none, it destroys the plug-in instance.  
Setting the display to something else again doesn't restore the previous  
plug-in instance. It creates a new one that starts playing from the  
beginning.

However, switching between inline, inline-block, block and table just  
changes the display and the plug-in keeps playing the file.

In Safari:

Setting to a display of none destroys the plug-in instance like Opera.

However, switching between inline, inline-block, block and table destroys  
the current instance and creates a new one each time, which causes the  
plug-in to start playing from the beginning.

In IE:

Once the &lt;object&gt; is shown for the first time, you can set its display to  
none, inline, inline-block, block and table and it will just change the  
display while letting the plug-in keep playing. This means that setting  
the display to none won't destroy the plug-in instance like it does in  
other browsers.

In Firefox:

Same as Safari.

So, is it IE's behavior we want here, or Opera's? The difference being  
that display: none can kill an already-started plug-in in Opera (and other  
browsers right now), while in IE, I think you have to actually remove the  
&lt;object&gt; from the document to get rid of it, or perhaps change its  
@type/@classid etc.

Judging by the use-case you mentioned above, IE's exact behavior in these  
situations is what's desired?

Or, are you saying that the &lt;object&gt; should also load the plug-in even  
when its display is set to none by default?

Just want to make sure what's desired, if HTML5 matches it and what each  
browser has to change.

&gt;&gt;<i> If the change is trivial, maybe someone can throw up an experimental FF
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or webkit binary with the fix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the change were trivial it would have been done back when the bug was  
</I>&gt;<i> filed, in 2001.
</I>
O.K. Thanks (thought maybe it was a political issue for why it wasn't  
fixed yet instead.)
