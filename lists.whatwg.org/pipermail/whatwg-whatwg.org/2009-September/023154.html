HTML documents sometimes occur in places in which they are not  
independently bookmarkable, such as in an HTML email, or embedded in  
an Atom or RSS feed.

They also sometimes occur in places in which it's generally not  
expected that someone will bookmark them, nor particularly easy to do  
so, such as within an iframe which is being used for a gadget or some  
sort of sandboxed content that isn't really independent of the  
containing page.

Yes, but sometimes you don't have a reasonable value for the title.  
Say you are converting some word processing document format to HTML  
(or spreadsheet, or slides, or anything of the sort); what would you  
use if there isn't any sort of heading to take the title from?

There are several options (you could use the filename, or look for  
anything heading like, or use the first couple of words), but if a  
&lt;title&gt; element is missing, then the user agent could do the same.

This has the problem of duplicating content, which may get out of  
sync. And why can't the user agent just extract the title from the  
heading if it needs it rather than the generator?

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, my concern is that a validator should be useful as an authoring

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leaving out &lt;title&gt; is very much like leaving out a paragraph of text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and not something that should matter for validation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As it affects user interfaces, and since the cost of including a  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;title&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> is so low, I think it makes sense to continue to make it required.
</I>
As it's something that affects the user interface in a fairly visible  
way, it's not likely that many authors will neglect to use it if it's  
useful to do so. However, in some cases it is not possible to include  
a title, or there isn't any really useful title to include, so I'm not  
sure why it should be required in those cases.

This seems somewhat analogous to the &lt;img alt&gt; case; there are some  
times when you don't have any useful text to put in there, and putting  
in auto-generated placeholder text just to conform seems less than  
useful. The number of pages unhelpfully titled &quot;Untitled&quot; or &quot;Untitled  
page&quot; seems to confirm this.

There are other cases in which a title just isn't all that useful,  
like an iframe; the title will be invisible, and it's pretty uncommon  
for people to open that iframe in a new tab and then bookmark it from  
there (unless maybe they happen to be web geeks like us). For example,  
see Google Gadgets &lt;<A HREF="http://www.google.com/webmasters/gadgets/">http://www.google.com/webmasters/gadgets/</A>&gt;, or  
iframe sandboxes used for isolating untrusted content while still  
being inline in the page.

So, my recommendation is that &lt;title&gt; be made optional; perhaps a  
validator could issue a warning if you leave it off, but there are  
perfectly valid cases of wanting to produce an HTML document that  
doesn't have any sort of meaningful title or for which a title will  
never be seen or used, it doesn't seem likely that people will forget  
it in cases in which it's useful, and right now it is sometimes being  
filled with useless values like &quot;Untitled&quot; that actually get in the  
way of a UA computing a better value (such as the URL or the top level  
heading).
