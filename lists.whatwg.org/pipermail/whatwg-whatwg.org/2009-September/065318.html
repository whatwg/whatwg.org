</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If you're going to route your localstorage access through an async API
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; anyway, then you might as well proxy it to the parent page - there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; little advantage to doing it otherwise, other than access to lexically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; scoped resources from within your callback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, there's a pretty big difference. With the current state of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affairs, if a worker wants to make a computation based on values in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the localStorage, and store the result in localStorage, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extremely hard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, say that a worker want to perform the following operation:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> localStorage.result = F(localStorage.n);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where F(n) is the n:th value in the Fibonacci sequence.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To do this today the worker would first have to call the main window
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get the localStoreage.n value. It could then calculate the result
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of F(localStorage.n). It would then send a message to the main window
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to store the result in localStorage.result. However in the meantime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> localStorage.n might have changed, which causes an inconsistent state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So instead the worker has to send both the value of localStorage.n as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well as the result to the window. The window can then check if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> localStorage.n has changed. If it has changed, the window has to send
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new value back to the worker, and then the worker has to redo its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calculation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This has several problems. It's bug prone since the developer might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not realize the race condition. It's very hard to do correctly. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even when done correctly risks wasting a lot of cycles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An alternative solution is to do all calculations in the main window,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which has synchronous access to localStorage. But the whole point of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worker is to avoid having to do heavy work in the window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, with the solution Jeremy proposed, calculating the above
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> algorithm can be done in the worker after the worker while the worker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is inside the callback and thus have synchronous access to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> localStorage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Say that instead of calculating Fibonacci numbers, we were storing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> database of emails in localStorage, and using a worker to synchronize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that database to a server. In this case it seems extermely complex to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to communicate asynchronously through the window and deal with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> race conditions where the user is modifying the email database at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that some page from the same origin might also try to access
</I>&gt;<i> LocalStorage. &#160;If it does, it'll block the entire event loop until the
</I>&gt;<i> worker is finished. &#160;I can't think of how to &quot;fix&quot; this in a way that's not
</I>&gt;<i> racy. &#160;My originally proposal was written in the hope that developers would
</I>&gt;<i> be more cautious since they're doing things inside an async callback, but
</I>&gt;<i> the more I think about it, the more I think this isn't realistic.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we have 3 options:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Create a LocalStorage like API that can only be accessed in an async way
</I>&gt;<i> via pages (kind of like WebDatabase).
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Remove any atomicity/consistency&#160;guarantees&#160;from&#160;synchronous&#160;LocalStorage
</I>&gt;<i> access within pages (like IE8 currently does) and add an async interface for
</I>&gt;<i> when pages do need atomicity/consistency.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Come up with a completely different storage API that all the browser
</I>&gt;<i> vendors are willing to implement that only allows Async access from within
</I>&gt;<i> pages. &#160;WebSimpleDatabase might be a good starting point for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 is probably the simplest to implement, but it seems pretty hacky and it's
</I>&gt;<i> likely not powerful enough for many advanced web apps (offline web mail
</I>&gt;<i> would be an example). &#160;If we do 2, many (most?) web developers will just use
</I>&gt;<i> the sync interface and write racy apps. &#160;3 will take the longest time to do,
</I>&gt;<i> but is definitely the best long term solution.
</I>
I think 2 is right out. 1 is what we should have done in the first
place if we had thought about the multiple processes thing. The only
thing that's bad about 1 is that we're creating two extremely similar
features. So I'd say 1 is unfortunate rather than hacky.

3 is is something that I personally think we should do no matter what
as I'm not a big fan of the current SQL interface. But I wonder if we
might want to do 1 anyway. After all, localStorage and the SQL APIs
were both suggested. Presumably to allow localStorage to handle the
simple cases and SQL to handle the more complex ones.
