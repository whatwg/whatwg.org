</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Calls to transaction() are queued and executed serially per-origin

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> branch of this thread.  Later script executions can observe inconsistent

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Transactions can also fail visibly if write-to-disk fails (probably also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other ways I haven't considered).  It's not clear what should happen wrt
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your proposal in this case.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If so, I agree with roc's responses to them that they could probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be handled without surfacing errors to the developer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OTOH, I'm not really against adding the concept of fallibility here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  In fact, I believe that the &quot;Synchronous database API&quot; describes the same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> transaction semantics as I proposed in the OP.  That spec adds implicit
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> begin/commitTransaction and read-only transactions, but otherwise the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> semantics are the same.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So I'd like to amend my original proposal to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Use Synchronous Web Database API transaction semantics.  Except do not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> offer readTransaction: a transaction is implicitly a read-only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> transaction
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if only getItem() is called on localStorage from within
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> localStorage.transaction().
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agree. That is what I was trying to propose, too. I'm not sure where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we disagree :). Is it just that my proposal has no concept of errors?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not against adding them, mainly I was trying to keep my proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple for purposes of discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ay, there's the rub: I think the disagreement is between &quot;mutex&quot; vs.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;transaction&quot; semantics.  So far, I think perhaps &quot;mutex&quot; has been used as
</I>&gt;<i> shorthand for &quot;transaction.&quot;  But they aren't the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we all agree that a script may fail to modify localStorage in some
</I>&gt;<i> situations (irrespective of global mutex vs. per-domain mutex). One camp,
</I>&gt;<i> wanting &quot;mutex&quot; semantics, would prefer to pretend that the failures never
</I>&gt;<i> happen and let scripts clean up the mess (partially-applied changes) if they
</I>&gt;<i> do occur.  This is semantically broken, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second camp, wanting &quot;transaction&quot; semantics, explicitly acknowledge to
</I>&gt;<i> web authors that localStorage is fallible, guarantee that modifications to
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage are atomic, and notify scripts when modifications can't be made
</I>&gt;<i> atomically.  This is the same approach taken by Web Database.  IMHO, this is
</I>&gt;<i> much better semantically because (i) it gives web apps stronger guarantees;
</I>&gt;<i> and (ii) it makes the discussion about global mutex/per-domain
</I>&gt;<i> mutex/non-blocking an implementation issue rather semantic issue, as it
</I>&gt;<i> should be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can those in the first camp explain why &quot;mutex&quot; semantics is better than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;transaction&quot; semantics?  And why it's desirable to have one DB spec specify
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;transaction&quot; semantics (Web Database) and a second specify &quot;mutex&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> semantics (localStorage)?
</I>

The way I understand it, there's 3 camps...and I think they've been abusing
both the word transaction and mutex.  We should probably all start being
more precise with our wording in this respect.  :-)


Those who want pessimistic transactions.  I.e. using locking so that you
never need to do a rollback (because it can never &quot;fail&quot;).  This would be
compatible with either a sync or an async interface.

Those who optimistic transactions.  I.e. rollback may happen.  Either we
need to restrict what can be done during a localStorage transaction or we
need to have an exception that tells the script to undo itself.  This was
the original proposal, AFAICT.  It would work with both a sync or an async
interface.

Those who want a queue.  I.e. those who want an asynchronous callback based
interface and the UA will only call one callback at a time.  Perhaps on a
per-origin basis.  Note that this can never &quot;fail&quot;, need to be rolled back,
etc.


I believe Aaron is in the queue camp with me.  I'm becoming more and more
convinced that Chromium should/will not implement the storage mutex at all
(even for LocalStorage) unless we can come up with a way for event loops to
not be blocked.  And, as far as I can tell, Async interfaces are the only
way to accomplish this.
