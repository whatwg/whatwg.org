I believe this opinion was expressed by people who hadn't yet tried to do it
in a web browser with multiple event loops.  :-)

A bunch of us working on Chromium have spent a lot of time
thinking about this and I don't think it's just a matter of burdening user
agents.  I think it's pretty clear that the spec, as is, is not possible to
implement without making it trivial for a single website to lock up all of
your event loops....which is a major step back in terms of browser
performance...especially in this multi-core world we now live in.  :-)

This is especially true if the storage mutex extends to cookies since one
tab running a poorly written site can lock everything up.  And it sounds
like, because of that, no one is going to implement the storage mutex for
cookies per the spec.  I really do think it's time to discuss alternatives.
