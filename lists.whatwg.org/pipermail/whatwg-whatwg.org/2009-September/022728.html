I agree with you as an author.  I wrote an HTML output function in
MediaWiki assuming that what the standard says is known to be
interoperable, which is apparently wrong.  If I hadn't been keeping up
with HTML 5, I would have introduced an XSS vulnerability because of
some browsers' handling of `.

If the problem will go away with time, then perhaps a later version of
the standard could make such unquoted attributes conforming, once
there's no more problem with them.
