</I>
Calls to transaction() are queued and executed serially per-origin
with exclusive access. There is no such thing as a transaction abort
because there cannot be consistency problems because of the serialized
access.

&gt;<i> You'd have to implement it via a mutex.
</I>
I think you would have a queue of all pending requests for access to
storage, along with their associated callbacks, message loops, and
execution environments. Each time the local storage frees up, if there
is any queued request, invoke the callback in the correct environment.

&gt;<i> An optimized implementation could

</I>&gt;<i> WebDatabase if I understand it correctly.
</I>
You can't do this because upgrading the lock could block the UI
thread. Same thing with the database spec.

If you want to get fancy, the transaction() method can take a
read/write param. This is what the database spec does, but I think it
is overkill here, personally.
