Only if those scripts don't use any of the banned interfaces and

I'm not sure that throwing an error is a good idea. Would you throw an  
error when there's no declared encoding? That seems to be annoying for the  
common case of just using ASCII characters. Throwing an error when there  
is a declared encoding that is not utf-8 might work, but are there many  
scripts that have a declared encoding and are not utf-8?

I think it is to just ignore any declared encoding and assume utf-8. If  
people are using non-ascii in another encoding, then they would notice by  
seeing that their text looks like garbage. Browsers could also log  
messages to their error consoles about encoding declarations declaring  
non-utf-8 and/or sequences of bytes that are not valid utf-8.
