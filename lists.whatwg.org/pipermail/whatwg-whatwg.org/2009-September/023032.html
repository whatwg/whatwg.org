<PRE>Jeremy, what's the use case here - do developers want workers to have access
to shared local storage with pages? Or do they just want workers to have
access to their own non-shared local storage?
Because we could just give workers their own separate WorkerLocalStorage and
let them have at it. A worker could block all the other accesses to
WorkerLocalStorage within that domain, but so be it - it wouldn't affect
page access, and we already had that issue with the (now removed?)
synchronous SQL API.

I think a much better case can be made for WorkerLocalStorage than for &quot;give
workers access to page LocalStorage&quot;, and the design issues are much
simpler.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One possible solution is to add an asynchronous callback interface for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function myCallback(localStorage) {

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; executeLocalStorageCallback(myCallback);  // TODO: Make this name better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The interface is simple.  You can only access localStorage via a
</I>&gt;<i> callback.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Any use outside of the callback is illegal and would raise an exception.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  The callback would acquire the storage mutex during execution, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worker's execution would not block during this time.  Of course, it's
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible for a poorly behaving worker to do large amounts
</I>&gt;<i> of computation in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the callback, but hopefully the fact they're executing in a callback
</I>&gt;<i> makes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the developer more aware of the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off, I agree that not having localStorage in workers is a big
</I>&gt;<i> problem that we need to address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I were designing the localStorage interface today I would use the
</I>&gt;<i> above interface that you suggest. Grabbing localStorage can only be
</I>&gt;<i> done asynchronously, and while you're using it, no one else can get a
</I>&gt;<i> reference to it. This way there are no race conditions, but also no
</I>&gt;<i> way for anyone to have to lock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So one solution is to do that in parallel to the current localStorage
</I>&gt;<i> interface. Let's say we introduce a 'clientStorage' object. You can
</I>&gt;<i> only get a reference to it using a 'getClientStorage' function. This
</I>&gt;<i> function is available both to workers and windows. The storage is
</I>&gt;<i> separate from localStorage so no need to worry about the 'storage
</I>&gt;<i> mutex'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is of course a risk that a worker grabs on to the clientStorage
</I>&gt;<i> and holds it indefinitely. This would result in the main window (or
</I>&gt;<i> another worker) never getting a reference to it. However it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> affect responsiveness of that window, it's just that the callback will
</I>&gt;<i> never happen. While that's not ideal, it seems like a smaller problem
</I>&gt;<i> than any other solution that I can think of. And the WebDatabase
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces are suffering from the same problem if I understand things
</I>&gt;<i> correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a couple of other interesting things we could expose on top of
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, a synchronous API for workers. We could allow workers to
</I>&gt;<i> synchronously get a reference to clientStorage. If someone is
</I>&gt;<i> currently using clientStorage then the worker blocks until the storage
</I>&gt;<i> becomes available. We could either use a callback as the above, which
</I>&gt;<i> blocks until the clientStorage is acquired and only holds the storage
</I>&gt;<i> until the callback exists. Or we could expose clientStorage as a
</I>&gt;<i> property which holds the storage until control is returned to the
</I>&gt;<i> worker eventloop, or until some explicit release API is called. The
</I>&gt;<i> latter would be how localStorage is now defined, with the important
</I>&gt;<i> difference that localStorage exposes the synchronous API to windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, allow several named storage areas. We could add an API like
</I>&gt;<i> getNamedClientStorage(name, callback). This would allow two different
</I>&gt;<i> workers to simultaneously store things in a storage areas, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> they don't need to use the *same* storage area. It would also allow a
</I>&gt;<i> worker and the main window to simultaneously use separate storage
</I>&gt;<i> areas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However we need to be careful if we add both above features. We can't
</I>&gt;<i> allow a worker to grab multiple storage areas at the same time since
</I>&gt;<i> that could cause deadlocks. However with proper APIs I believe we can
</I>&gt;<i> avoid that.
