You mean a download link I can click? Sure, but then the site has no  
ability to access that data later unless I explicitly locate the file  
and upload it. That's not the same thing as a storage area it can  
access.

In case it wasn't clear: In my example, the thing you're saving isn't  
a document file (like an SVG or PDF or whatever) but the actual local  
storage database for the site. Once that's been created, the site can  
continue to use it.

&gt;<i> Also, we'd have to keep providing persistent storage without user  
</I>&gt;<i> input,
</I>&gt;<i> so that the site can store preferences or the like without prompting  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> user (just like cookies today).
</I>
Yes, I think it's unavoidable that there be two tiers of local  
storage, a small one that doesn't require permission and is equivalent  
to a cookie, and a larger one that does need permission. That's what a  
lot of the discussion here has been about.

&gt;&gt;<i> I go through my Web Documents folder, see the old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;SooperAnimator.com Data&quot; file, and trash it to save disk space.
</I>&gt;<i> You can do that today with cookies, which local storage is supposed  
</I>&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;<i> exposed as in the UI. Do users ever look through their old cookies?
</I>
You can't store 50MB of data in a cookie. I'm talking about the entire  
local storage of a site here, not a 40-byte session ID or something.
