&lt;snip&gt;
If it can be shown that it is not ever possible for script in one origin
to synchronously invoke script in another origin, then I guess we could
have per-origin locks instead of a single lock.
&lt;/snip&gt;

Here are two cases I know of where it is possible to have synchronous
script execution across origins:

* Plugins. It is possible for script to invoke a plugin function in
one frame, and for the plugin to synchronously execute script in
another frame. We have addressed this in the spec by saying that
invoking a plugin releases the storage mutex, but that doesn't really
solve the problem. We are exchanging violation of run-to-completion
for deadlock. I guess it is an improvement, but it is still a bug.

* In WebKit, onresize is invoked synchronously. You can cause
cross-origin synchronous script execution by resizing an iframe.
AFAIK, the spec does not disallow this event from being synchronous.

I found the second case after only a few minutes of thinking about it.
I suspect there are more since it was never a design goal to prevent
synchronous script execution across origins.

We could patch each case like this by releasing the mutex, but each
time we do that, we poke another hole in run to completion.

I also suspect such patches will be difficult to maintain. Even if we
update implementations to invoke onresize asynchronously, how
confident can we be in interactions between such unrelated components
as event dispatch and storage continuing to work correctly?

Finally, even with these hacks, we have problems. In a MELUA (I love
that acronym!), with per-origin local storage mutexes, we still can
end up with unresponsive UI because it is possible to have the same
origin running on different event loops.

Adding an asynchronous step to acquire the mutex neatly solves all
these problems. We get run-to-completion, and we never block an event
loop on waiting for a mutex.

</I>
Ok, I don't have a strong preference on this. Transaction semantics
seem better to me, but only marginally so.
