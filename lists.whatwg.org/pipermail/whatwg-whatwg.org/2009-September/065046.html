</I>
The spec requires a single storage mutex for the entire UA. Therefore
in a MELUA a web page can become unresponsive while waiting for some
other page to give up the lock. This is not good and something we have
tried to avoid everywhere else in the spec.

Attempts to address this by doing per-origin locks wind up with
deadlocks being possible.

</I>
Cool, that is the only point I was trying to make.

</I>
It sounds like you're talking about these issues that you listed a bit earlier:

 * clear private data
 * close tab
 * quit UA
 * &quot;slow script&quot; timeout
 * store-to-disk failure
 * crash

Right?

If so, I agree with roc's responses to them that they could probably
be handled without surfacing errors to the developer.

OTOH, I'm not really against adding the concept of fallibility here.
That wasn't really my point. Mainly, I just think that:

a) We can't have synchronous access to the storage API
b) We should not have an API that requires an author to explicitly
begin and commit transactions

&gt;<i> I have to admit that I didn't closely read the Web Database spec before
</I>&gt;<i> making the OP. &#160;Like Rob, my scan of the text led me to believe that it
</I>&gt;<i> provided an API to asynchronously execute SQL free from script side effects.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;It does *not*. &#160;Arbitrary side-effecty script statements can execute within
</I>&gt;<i> Web Database transactions.
</I>
Yeah, I meant to correct Rob on that.

&gt;<i> And these transactions can be synchronous. &#160;And
</I>&gt;<i> like my OP concerning localStorage, Web Database transactions are allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> fail by the spec.
</I>
Right.

&gt;<i> In fact, I believe that the &quot;Synchronous database API&quot; describes the same
</I>&gt;<i> transaction semantics as I proposed in the OP. &#160;That spec adds implicit
</I>&gt;<i> begin/commitTransaction and read-only transactions, but otherwise the
</I>&gt;<i> semantics are the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd like to amend my original proposal to be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;Use Synchronous Web Database API transaction semantics. &#160;Except do not
</I>&gt;<i> offer readTransaction: a transaction is implicitly a read-only transaction
</I>&gt;<i> if only getItem() is called on localStorage from within
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage.transaction().
</I>
Agree. That is what I was trying to propose, too. I'm not sure where
we disagree :). Is it just that my proposal has no concept of errors?
I'm not against adding them, mainly I was trying to keep my proposal
simple for purposes of discussion.

Note: you're mentioning synchronous transactions here. I think that
the callback for localStorage.transaction() *must* be run
asynchronously to avoid blocking on access to the storage. I presume
this is what you meant. Right?
