Told by whom, if I might ask?

This doesn't actually specify what Gecko implements.  In particular, the 
current spec text means that if I have a plug-in installed which 
supports text/html and the &lt;object&gt; has type=&quot;text/html&quot; then the data 
should be rendered as text/html regardless of the server type, even 
though it will be rendered by the browser itself, not by the plug-in. 
This was explicitly something I wanted to avoid in the Gecko code, and 
was called out that way in the bugs I referenced.

Was that difference intentional?

Another other difference is the way data-sniffing is applied.  In Gecko, 
data-sniffing is applied on the HTTP layer in this case, so that the 
type considered in subsubstep 3 of your algorithm already takes 
data-sniffing into account.  In practical terms the difference is that 
data-sniffing only occurs if the HTTP response from the server doesn't 
deliver a Content-Type header (modulo the text/plain thing, of course). 
  If we assume that no plug-in has registered itself for 
application/octet-stream, then the only cases that lead to a different 
behavior between the two algorithms are those of the server sending 
text/plain (for binary data) or application/octet-stream as the type. 
Your algorithm leads to data-snifing in both cases, while no 
data-sniffing is performed in Gecko for either case.

I'm not particularly happy performing data-sniffing in those cases, 
particularly the text/plain case (since that can lead to such data being 
handled as text/html by the UA, given how your spec text is written 
right now).

As far as text/plain goes, the current spec text means that if I have a 
PostScript file that includes some &quot;binary&quot; bytes in the first 512 bytes 
and my web server sends text/plain for it and the &lt;object&gt; has a type 
attribute with the value &quot;text/plain&quot; then the data will be treated as 
application/postscript.  That doesn't seem desirable to me.  Is it 
intentional?

&gt;&gt;<i> 3)  A number of sites not only send a bogus server-provided type (e.g. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application/octet-stream) but also use a bogus type attribute 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (specifically, application/plugin-mimetype; I suspect this is a relic of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Netscape's devedge documentation using that as an example placeholder).  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See &lt;<A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=393756">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=393756</A>&gt;.  The URI 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extension is used to get the type to really use in those cases in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gecko...  If desired, I could probably dig through and figure out the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exact conditions that trigger this case.

</I>&gt;<i> dependence on extensions as possible.
</I>
What the Gecko code basically does is that if the type is 
application/octet-stream after everything else has been done (so the 
place where your current spec says &quot;then change the resource type to be 
unknown, so that the sniffing rules in the next step are invoked&quot;) then 
we examine the extension of the URI.  If that extension exists and if 
there's a plug-in registered for that extension, then we set the 
&quot;resource type&quot; (in your current draft's terms) to be the associated 
MIME type reported by the plug-in.  I'm not sure where this list of 
(extension,type) pairs comes from, but it looks like the plug-in 
provides it somehow (possibly even in that form, looking at
