This seems reasonable. Different apps really do want different idle- 
time thresholds (if only for compatibility with other manifestations  
of the app, i.e. an IM platform), but I think the event-plus-custom- 
timeout mechanism would let them achieve that.

&gt;<i> Another alternative is to have no event, and just a property:

</I>
This would have to be deliberately fuzzed, as it is apparently  
possible to guess user typing by looking at the timing between  
keystrokes. Rounding it to the nearest second would probably suffice.

The problem with this API is that, once the app determines the user is  
idle, it has to keep polling lastUserActionTime until it sees it  
change. I'm not fond of APIs that require the client to poll.

The best solution, I think, would be both of the above. The  
lastUserActionTime property lets a page test whether the user's  
already idle at the time it loads, and the event lets it detect  
transitions without having to poll.
