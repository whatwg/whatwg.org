My suggestion is to only perform text/plain &quot;is this text or binary&quot; 
sniffing where it belongs: on the HTTP level; since it's a workaround 
for a particular HTTP server bug.  It shouldn't affect other type metadata.

Perform the sniffing such that it detects as either text/plain or 
application/octet-stream.

Then if it's application/octet-stream we'll end up using the @type. 
Though see below on other sniffing issues.

This does fail to sniff text/plain as the various &quot;non-scriptable&quot; 
types, but I question how desirable that is anyway, honestly.  If we 
want to preserve this property without clobbering @type=&quot;text/plain&quot; 
then I need to think a bit more about how to specify the behavior here.

Maybe your option 2 is what would give that behavior... I can work 
through it if you'd like.

Your option 1 would be ok if that's what we want (but a change from 
HTML4 and what UAs at least _try_ to implement now; I'm not sure whether 
it's desirable on its own).  Your option 3 is a bit too magic for 
text/plain in @type; unnecessarily so unless we want to go the full 
option 1 route.  All in my opinion, of course.

&gt;&gt;<i> My concern about text/plain data being sniffed as text/html by your 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current algorithm (even with the changes you've made) seems to remain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unaddressed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I had. Can you walk me through how anything labeled text/plain 
</I>&gt;<i> could get sniffed as text/html with the new text?
</I>
Hmm.  Assume the type attribute is not set and HTML data is sent as 
text/plain and contains a &quot;binary byte&quot; in the first 512 bytes (can just 
stick it in the &lt;title&gt; or something).  Also assume no plug-in claims to 
support the URI's file extension.

At step 3, the resource type is set to text/plain.

At step 4, the resource type is sniffed as application/octet-stream, 
since text/html is marked as scriptable in [MIMESNIFFF].

At step 5, there is no @type, and the resource type is 
application/octet-stream, so the resource type is changed to unknown.

At step 6, nothing changes since there is no plug-in supporting the 
URI's file extension.

At step 7, the resource type is &quot;unknown&quot;, so it is changed to the 
&quot;sniffed type of the resource&quot;.

Maybe I simply misunderstood this last reference, by way of contrasting 
it with what step 4 says and you mean to apply the full sniffing 
algorithm, including the special-cases for text/plain, and not just 
section 5 of [MIMESNIFF].  In that case there wouldn't be a problem (the 
data would get sniffed as application/octet-stream).  That wasn't quite 
clear, but I can see now that this is probably what you meant.
