It's hard to tell -- it depends on how fast implementations line up on 
what HTML5 already says.


&gt;<i> Similarly, if it was determined that a sufficient number of browsers

</I>
It's not just this feature -- for example, &lt;canvas&gt; is pretty well 
implemented, but we're not adding new features to it at the moment, 
because browser implementors jump at the chance to implement anything I 
add to canvas, instead of fixing other bugs. So each time we add a canvas 
feature, we delay the time until other things are implemented well.


&gt;<i> As you stated, both IE and Safari have this thing pretty nailed down for

</I>
Both IE and Safari are quite buggy when it comes to drag-and-drop 
actually, at least compared to what the spec says (especially IE).


&gt;<i> Firefox has done a considerable amount of work to implement this as well 
</I>&gt;<i> and at the very least advertises it as a &quot;complete&quot; feature. Is there 
</I>&gt;<i> some way to measure the quality of implementations?
</I>
We'll need a test suite.

Neither.

As an extreme example: if a thousand people want the HTML5 spec to include 
an element that executes arbitrary author-provided inline assembler, and 
one person points out that that would allow for remote code execution 
attacks, then the one person wins.

An example where this actually happened: lots of people think we should 
include the longdesc=&quot;&quot; attribute in HTML5. However, we did some research, 
and found that it isn't a technically good solution according to the 
collected data. So we don't have longdesc=&quot;&quot;.
