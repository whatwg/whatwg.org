I think it's predictable that it will be used in badly wrong ways  
without implementing it. Explicit application-managed locking is a  
massive failure as a mechanism for managing concurrency.

&gt;<i> As for the idea of a sync API:  What if some library/framework and

</I>
If we want to go async, then I'd rather have an asynchronous way to  
acquire an *actual* lock on the resource (as with the LocalStorage  
async transaction proposal), than an async advisory locking model.  
Having both asynchronicity *and* advisory locks seems like the worst  
of both worlds.

On the other hand, if we offer only the equivalent of tryLock() and  
not a blocking lock(), it's almost certain Web apps will build spin  
locks in the way you describe, leading to wasteful CPU usage, bad  
performance, and the possibility of deadlocks.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's another idea that I think is actually kind of cool:  What if  
</I>&gt;<i> we kept track of locking precedence (i.e. the graph of which locks  
</I>&gt;<i> have been taken while other locks were held) and threw an exception  
</I>&gt;<i> if any lock was ever taken in a way that violated the graph.  In  
</I>&gt;<i> other words, we wouldn't make the developer tell us the locking  
</I>&gt;<i> precedence, and we wouldn't wait until you hit an actual deadlock.   
</I>&gt;<i> Instead we would look for the first call site that _could_ have  
</I>&gt;<i> deadlocked.  A long time ago, I was working on a project that had  
</I>&gt;<i> some deadlock problems.  We implemented exactly this and it worked  
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well.
</I>
This seems like a very challenging programming model for little gain.  
If the locks are purely advisory, they do not prevent race conditions,  
but a discipline to prevent deadlocks will still make them very hard  
to use. Note also that the possibility of synchronous cross-site code  
execution would require a lock precedence graph to be cross-site to  
really prevent deadlocks, but it would be impossible for a Web  
application to guarantee anything about lock order with respect to Web  
apps in different origins. The other possibility is to drop all locks  
in the case of synchronous cross-origin code execution, but then these  
advisory locks would not even be useful for preventing race conditions.

Locking is broken - just don't do it.

Maciej
