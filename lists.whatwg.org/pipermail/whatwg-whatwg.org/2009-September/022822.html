</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And second, can scripts be notified that the transaction failed (or was

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AFAICT this is irrespective of sync/async/optimistic/pessimistic/queue.
</I>&gt;<i>  Any implementation has to deal with this error somehow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the current localStorage spec, if a setItem() fails because space is

</I>&gt;<i> change in setItem().  That is, setItem() is atomic --- it either applies or
</I>&gt;<i> not (not partially applied).  But modifications to localStorage *before*
</I>&gt;<i> that failing setItem(), within the same storage mutex acquire/release set,
</I>&gt;<i> *are* applied to backing store.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the Web Database spec, if executing a SQL statement in a Transaction
</I>&gt;<i> would cause space quota to be exceeded, then *none* of the statements in the
</I>&gt;<i> transaction are executed (i.e. none committed to backing store), and the
</I>&gt;<i> Transaction fails with QUOTA_ERR.  The unit of atomicity for Web Database is
</I>&gt;<i> that Transaction object --- either all statements in Transaction
</I>&gt;<i> successfully execute or none do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure whether you're proposing that modifications within a
</I>&gt;<i> localStorage.transaction() callback are atomic (all applied or none applied)
</I>&gt;<i> in the face of quota exceeded.  (I'm proposing that they *should* be
</I>&gt;<i> atomic.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you're proposing that scripts *cannot* be notified of quota

</I>&gt;<i> discuss.  But I want to make sure we're on the same page first :).  (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> proposing that scripts *should* be able to be notified of this.)
</I>

The way it works right now is that an exception is thrown and that's it.  I
think it'd be perfectly acceptable for the behavior to remain, even if it's
inside a &quot;transaction&quot;.  In other words, I don't think the transaction
necessarily needs to stop or anything.  I think most app developers will
want to explicitly handle out of space errors (they're not just going to go
away on their own), but probably won't want to explicitly deal with
transient errors (like what you can see with optimistic transactions).

I don't think quota errors should be grouped in with any atomicity
guarantees, in other words.

Are there any other examples of failures you can have within a pessimistic
transaction?
