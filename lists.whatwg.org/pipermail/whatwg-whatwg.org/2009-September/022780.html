</I>
To be clear, that's not what I had in mind at all.  I envisioned a 
synchronous API that speaks in terms of fallible, atomic/consistent 
transactions.  Mutexes are implementation details that the spec would 
not mention.

It's easy to make an async API out of a sync one by using setTimeout(0, 
...).  It's harder to go the other way.

&gt;<i> Would the transaction function be defined so that it never runs immediately
</I>&gt;<i> but is always enqueued? Also, I think the function name should make it
</I>&gt;<i> clearer that it's an asynchronous callback:
</I>&gt;<i> window.localStorage.queueTransaction or somesuch?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm against having explicit begin/commit methods for the same reason
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as I am for the SQLDatabase feature:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - It is easy to forget to commit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The most likely paths in an application to be wrong are ones that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are rarely run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Therefore many applications will contain uncommon paths that end up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hung (responsive, but still unable to make forward progress) and with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uncommitted data
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this is true if you never implicitly commit the transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> But if you were to implicitly commit the transaction when a script runs to
</I>&gt;<i> completion, would that negate the most serious of these issues? I'm defining
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;completion&quot; as &quot;all those places where the current spec says the storage
</I>&gt;<i> mutex is unlocked&quot;, which seems equivalent to &quot;the places script can block
</I>&gt;<i> on network or UI activity&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It sounds like you're proposing to make the unit of run-to-completion 
implicitly delineate localStorage transactions?  This is fine but it 
complicates the handling of failed transactions, IMHO.

&gt;<i> I suspect that making incompatible changes to the existing storage API is
</I>&gt;<i> going to be a hard sell for some authors: could we continue to support
</I>&gt;<i> completely transaction-free access to storage, in addition to the race-free
</I>&gt;<i> queued version. This would allow authors (JS libraries) to do
</I>&gt;<i> runtime-detection of the form:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if (window.localStorage.transaction === undefined)
</I>&gt;<i>   window.localStorage.transaction = function(fn) {
</I>&gt;<i>     window.setTimeout(fn, 0);
</I>&gt;<i>   };
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No one has responded directly to my original proposal of making 
|<i>window.localStorage === undefined| until |window.transaction| or 
</I>whatever has been accessed.  Unlike your proposal and a similar one from 
Jeremy, mine is a &quot;safe&quot; (non-racy) way for spec-compliant UAs to &quot;bend&quot; 
backwards compatibility without explicitly breaking it.  Web apps slow 
to change should theoretically be prepared for |window.localStorage === 
undefined| anyway, as not all UAs support localStorage.  And if a UA 
doesn't support window.transaction, a web app that cares never needs to 
worry about racy localStorage because in non-compliant UAs, 
|<i>window.transaction === undefined|.
</I>
Cheers,
Chris
