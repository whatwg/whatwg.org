That sounds good, how?

My problem with storage mutex boils down to the fact that by the letter of
&gt;<i> the spec, a script can lock out the UA indefinitely by just reading a

</I>

What do you mean &quot;lock out the UA&quot;?


&gt;<i> Transactional semantics seems to be a better abstraction, and an ancillary

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree with you. However, there is still the compatibility issue. (Some
people may also argue that what we currently have is simpler for authors
than any explicit transactional API --- personally I'm unsure if that
matters.)

&quot;He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are
healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his
own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; [Isaiah
53:5-6]
