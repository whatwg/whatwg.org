</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before the move to structured clones one could tell if a key was set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by calling getItem() and seeing if it returned null (had to use === as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone could have called setItem() w/ null, but that would be coerced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a string for storage). But with the latest draft's switch to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structured clones that test no longer clearly differentiates between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether the value returned by getItem() signifies that the key was not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set, or the key was set with the value null.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As written right now the only way to detect if a key was truly set is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to iterate through all of them with 'length' and key(). Perhaps a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contains() function that returns true/false based on whether the key
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is set is warranted? Otherwise you could do something like Python's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get() method on dicts where an optional second argument is provided to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getItem() which is returned only if the key is not set, allowing a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user-provided object represent a key not existing w/ ===.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And since I just subscribed to the mailing list, I was wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the whole workers/localStorage discussion ended or not, as I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide a (potentially minor) real-world use-case for sharing access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between the page and worker if people want to hear it (in a new email
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second method (optional second argument) is definitely the correct
</I>&gt;<i> one.  Common Lisp deals with similar issues by *returning* a second
</I>&gt;<i> value which is a boolean reflecting whether the key was in the hash
</I>&gt;<i> (and was simply set to the default value) or was missing (and thus the
</I>&gt;<i> default value was returned).  However, multiple return values isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> pattern used by most languages, so a second argument that switches the
</I>&gt;<i> function into returning the was-it-there bool is correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would say it's far from &quot;definitely the correct&quot; method.  I can see use
cases where both the default case and a containsItem() function would be
useful.  Why not add both?
