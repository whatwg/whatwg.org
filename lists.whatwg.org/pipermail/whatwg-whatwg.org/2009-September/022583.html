Ok, that sort of defeats the point as it will not be possible
to depend on this security function for HTML5 features released
before its appearance in the standard - my idea was that f ex 
WebStorage would refer to (and require) the new enhanced 
security model. 
I'd say it is extremely difficult to add a stricter security 
model on to a released standard (with deployed browsers) in a 
way so authors can depend on it.

On the other hand, there hasn't been an overwhelmingly positive
response (understatement ;-) on this suggestion, so 
unfortunately I guess it might better be dropped.

Best regards
Mike
