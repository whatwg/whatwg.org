</I>
Expecting developers to hack out a substring at all will only lead to
more bad designs. For example, Linux and Mac OS allow filenames to
contain backslashes. So if the filename was &quot;up\load.txt&quot; then
foo.value would be &quot;C:\fakepath\up\load.txt&quot; which could easily be
mistaken for &quot;load.txt&quot;. Fakepath will actually encourage developers
to fall into this trap, which just goes to show that it is not a
perfect solution.

the affected routers aren't interested in releasing updates to make
them work in non-fakepath browsers like Firefox, they may not be
interested in releasing updates for them at all. A specific list of
affected routers would go a long way to help us determine the
frequency and severity of their vulnerabilities, and whether firmware
updates are available to resolve them.

Incidentally, it would be really cool if the routers automatically
downloaded and installed their own updates. Automatic updates would
provide much more consistent security than asking end users to
regularly check for and install updates on their own.

</I>&gt;<i> (Speaking as an engineer who does not enjoy caving, but who is glad to

</I>
Essentially, you are choosing to trade long-term good design for
short-term compatibility. It's the quick and easy path, and it's not a
good idea. It would be like writing specifications for the IE7 (or
IE6) rendering engine and then declaring them to be the new standard.
Sure, sites that were only tested in IE7 would continue to work
perfectly, and you could throw in some cool new features too, but it
wouldn't fix the bugs that make IE7 hard to work with in the first
place. IE8 tries to offer the best of both worlds by having a
&quot;Compatibility View&quot; button--why can't fakepath just be another part
of this one-click workaround?

I know that I don't get to write the standard; the decision is
ultimately not up to me. If the major browser vendors agree to
standardize on fakepath then myself and other web developers will just
have to live with it. All I can do is share my perspective and hope it
makes a difference.
