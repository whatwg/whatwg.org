That's far too many things for me to change safely just to make the spec 
sound more formal. I'm as likely to introduce errors in doing this change 
as I am to fix everything I set out to fix.

Also, many of the contractions above are in explicitly non-normative text 
(like examples), and I definitely think it's fine to have them there.

Again, if there are specific cases (e.g. &quot;section 5.4.76's second 
paragraph says 'Browsers shouldn't do that', which is an ambiguous use of 
RFC2119 terminology, please use 'should not'&quot;), then let me know, but I'm 
not ready to make such a wide series of changes as you describe above.
