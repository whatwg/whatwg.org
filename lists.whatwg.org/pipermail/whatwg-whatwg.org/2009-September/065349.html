Ian,

Consider a webapp with U users, each with W widgets accessing
S services on the server.

The resources the server needs to service with with multiplexing
is O(U+S)

But if there is no multiplexing and each widget makes it's
own connection to a service (with associated buffers and state
machine), then the server resources could scale O(U*W*S).
If we make the simplifying assumption that each widget only
accesses 1 service, then scaling is still O(U*max(W,S))

Even if the per connection resources are small, it is the
non linear scaling that makes this too expensive for
large scale deployment.

This is a real problem already with HTTP.  It is why
products like netscalers and network concentrators exist.
There is a reason why default ulimit on unix is 1024.
There are license conditions on some operating
systems that require you to pay more if you want more
connections.  There are half a million hits if you
google &quot;too many connections&quot;!

It is not a good example and I know of no serious large scale
web application that uses CGI.  It is only for small scale
systems.

Imagine the response if you proposed standardizing the next
generations of web applications around CGI!!!!

If you did try, suddenly you would find your world populated
with things like SCGI, ISAPI, FastCGI, AJP, WSGI, servlets,
portlets and many other attempts to achieve the functionality and
scalability required by serious web applications.

I don't understand your point?

Why is the server side any different to the client side.
You don't expect most client side developers to write their own
browsers and websocket implementations do you?

Why do you expect server side developers to write their
own servers?

</I>
There is no wheel being reinvented.

TCP/IP is not there for hold state that is entirely private to the
application.

TCP/IP is there to create a channel between application (eg browser) to
application (eg server).

It is the job of the application level protocol (eg HTTP, SMTP, websocket,
etc) to route data between an application component (eg widget within
page within browser) and application component (eg resource within server).


So while you obviously think connections should not
be a limiting factor - the reality is that they are
and there is only a small design cost to make a protocol
that is not wasteful of connections.
