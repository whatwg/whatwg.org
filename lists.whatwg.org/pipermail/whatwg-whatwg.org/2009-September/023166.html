Speaking from experience, I have been using localStorage in my PhD
thesis work w/o any real need for structured clones (I would have used
Web Database but it isn't widely used yet and I was not sure if it was
going to make the cut in the end). All it took to come close to
simulating structured clones now was to develop my own compatibility
wrapper for localStorage (<A HREF="http://realstorage.googlecode.com">http://realstorage.googlecode.com</A> for those
who care) and add setJSONObject() and getJSONObject() methods on the
wrapper. Works w/o issue.

Actually, there is a third drawback to the structured clones, which is
creating a backwards-compatible layer for existing browsers to
simulate structured clones will probably be hard. Since JSON does not
cover the new object types being introduced in HTML5 you will most
likely have to stringify all the file types some how, prefix a type to
the JSON string, and then on getItem() parse the string.

But the constructor for all the types covered by the structured clone
algorithm will not let you create a perfect copy. Take RegExp; the
structured clone spec says you get to skip lastIndex. OK, but what
about constructing a RegExp object with the proper input, lastMatch,
lastParen, etc.? Would a wrapper have to re-execute the search on the
RegExp to fast-forward to the proper state of the stored object? That
sounds painful.

If you all are regretting localStorage already even though it's
deployed using strings on most browsers (I think Opera doesn't have
it?), I would agree with Jeremy that perhaps this part of the spec
should just be considered &quot;dead&quot; and not fiddled with to try to
improve it.
