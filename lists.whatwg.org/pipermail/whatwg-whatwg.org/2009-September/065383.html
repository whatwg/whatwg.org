I'm rather confused about what your question is. Are you asking if you  
can use question marks as an ad-hoc markup for unknown characters?  
There's nothing in HTML5 that will break that usage, so that should be  
fine. But I don't think that there's been anything in the history of  
HTML that has gone so far as appropriating formerly legal characters  
for markup. Can you point to such an example?

Is there a particular form of breakage that you are trying to avoid?  
HTML5 does obsolete a few features, though none that I think should be  
relevant to the use case that you provided, and it documents how  
browsers must render obsolete features which have worked in the past,  
so that features being made obsolete does not break anything that  
already works. If you can find examples in the draft of this not being  
the case, you should probably point those out.
