Oh, sure, I don't deny that. So is &quot;&lt;font&gt;&quot;, though, and we're not going 
to encourage that either.


&gt;<i> It's technically not a valid option, but it's the best we've got in HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> if you don't want the browser to preselect an option in your select box.
</I>
But if we're going to fix the problem here, it would be better to fix the 
problem by providing real menus or a real way to make &lt;select&gt;s have a 
label and require a selection, than it would by kludging the current model 
to do it without fixing the semantics.

I fully agree that we need to cater for the use case you gave; but I think 
it would need non-trivial changes and therefore I would like us to wait 
until the next version of the Web Forms draft.


&gt;<i> I simply think that my original proposal makes the most sense from a 
</I>&gt;<i> real-world web-apps implementation standpoint. Why deny authors the 
</I>&gt;<i> ability to require a select element when this method would match up with 
</I>&gt;<i> normal day-to-day usage of the element while not causing any negative 
</I>&gt;<i> side-effects (that I know of)?
</I>
As mpt pointed out, I do not really think the interaction model you are 
proposing really makes sense for users who are used to list boxes.


&gt;<i> However, if you cannot get past the semantic conflict, wouldn't it at 
</I>&gt;<i> least make sense to allow the required attribute on the select tag and 
</I>&gt;<i> have it say that at least one option must be selected? For any single 
</I>&gt;<i> select it would always be satisfied (since one option is always selected 
</I>&gt;<i> by the browser), but for a multiple select at least one option would 
</I>&gt;<i> have to be selected (since one is not always selected by the browser by 
</I>&gt;<i> default)?
</I>
What's the use case for multiple select being required?
