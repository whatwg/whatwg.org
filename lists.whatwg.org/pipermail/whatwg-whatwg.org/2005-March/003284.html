Yeah, I don't really like the attributes either. But it's better than the 
only other alternative I see (one attribute with a hard-to-parse syntax).


&gt;<i> It was my understanding (from reading previous threads) that there were

</I>
I have heard people say vague things, but I haven't heard any specific 
issues (short of &quot;I don't think it should be there at all&quot;). Lacking 
actual concrete issues, there's not much we can do. (I don't propose 
delaying that part of the spec while we wait for concrete issues.)


&gt;<i> As Olav suggests, it may be complex enough to warrant a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> document. That would give us some leeway to iron out any crinkles that 
</I>&gt;<i> the model is perceived as having.
</I>
We have the time to iron the problems out now, without splitting the 
document out. Someone just needs to say what it is that needs ironing! :-)


&gt;<i> I've thought about some changes we could make to the model but to be 
</I>&gt;<i> honest, I think it may be as good as we can do. Which is pretty good 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO.
</I>
Yeah, I think that sums up my own opinion too.
