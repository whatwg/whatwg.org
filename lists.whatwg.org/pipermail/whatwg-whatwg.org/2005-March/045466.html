<PRE>How about this. Instead of an autocomplete attribute to specific form
elements, how about an attribute that is less specific about
instructing the user agent what to do:

sensitiveinput=&quot;yes&quot;

we could place it over a form element or an input element.

&gt;<i>From here, here's what we do: the main issue revolves around shared
</I>computers in public places. Administrators of those computers SHOULD
be instructed to go into their user agent's preferences and enable a
feature that would take steps to protect sensitive information. This
&quot;step&quot; would look into various things, disabling autocomplete on forms
or form elements with the &quot;sensitiveinput&quot; attribute would be one of
the things such preference setting would do.

I'd keep the feature turned-off by default, while making it fairly
easy to enable in the preferences pane.

Upon the first installation of a user agent, upon the first encounter
for a &quot;sensitiveinput&quot; attribbute on a form, a user agent might
consider warning the user. In fact, i would throw this functionality
in the same bag as &quot;password reminder&quot; and &quot;password manager&quot;
features. The existing dialogs could be modified to talk about
&quot;sensitive information and passwords&quot;. So, when a user elects to &quot;save
passwords for this site&quot;, they'll also be electing to &quot;save sensitive
information&quot; for this site.

that should keep everybody happy, no?

</I>&gt;<i> I fully support your sentiment, but all this part of the spec is doing
</I>&gt;<i> is more closely matching unavoidable reality. In the current market,
</I>&gt;<i> form control vendors *will* support autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; -- whether it's
</I>&gt;<i> in any spec is completely irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a prisoners' dilemma that works like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Stupid banks and other e-commerce sites (which is a substantial
</I>&gt;<i>      proportion of them) think autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; improves their
</I>&gt;<i>      security.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  If any free-as-in-beer browser implements autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; while
</I>&gt;<i>      other browsers do not, these sites will *block the browsers* that do
</I>&gt;<i>      not, telling visitors to &quot;upgrade&quot; to the browser that does. (That's
</I>&gt;<i>      presumably why Microsoft implemented it in the first place.)
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  In the absence of collaboration between them, all browser vendors
</I>&gt;<i>      are forced to cave and recognize autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;, because not
</I>&gt;<i>      being able to save data entered on the site is a much better user
</I>&gt;<i>      experience than not being allowed to use the site at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if you want user agents to ignore autocomplete=, your most hopeful
</I>&gt;<i> course of action is to take it up with Microsoft. They are, currently,
</I>&gt;<i> the only UA vendor with enough (relatively) immovable market share to
</I>&gt;<i> de-implement autocomplete=, say &quot;stuff you&quot; to the banks and e-commerce
</I>&gt;<i> sites, and (by sheer weight of users) to force the sites to let them in
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. (Even then, a few would force their customers to use Firefox,
</I>&gt;<i> while others would convert their forms to non-autocompletable Flash,
</I>&gt;<i> Java, or PDF. Yes, that would be stupid, but I already said they were
</I>&gt;<i> stupid. And that's why I said &quot;form control vendors&quot; above, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;browser vendors&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A much longer-term strategy is to continue working toward wide use of
</I>&gt;<i> standards-compliant browsers (and Free plug-ins for Java and Flash that
</I>&gt;<i> implement auto-completion uncompromisingly), and then toward neutering
</I>&gt;<i> any ability for sites to tell what browser you're using. Then sites
</I>&gt;<i> won't be able to tell whether your browser or plug-ins support
</I>&gt;<i> autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; or not, there will be nothing they can do about it,
</I>&gt;<i> and you'll be able to use autocomplete with impunity.
