I obviously described the situation very badly, we must _also_ support
WF2 provided via Internet explorer plugins etc.

Having the author add in a line is not fine, I can't see the point in
having WF2 and a load of extra stuff to make it more implementable,
why not just have the extra stuff?  In any case extra author added
stuff also makes the &quot;is this a wf2 capable browser&quot; even harder to
deal with.

&gt;<i> But like I said, you are naturally entitled to disagree. Thankfully, this

</I>
It does if they both end up doing it and they collide because there's
no way for the page author to identify a WF2 browser (which there
isn't currently, and I've brought it up many times, so I'm surprised
it's not a still open issue)
