<PRE>It's been over a month since this comment was raised, there's numerous
other comments gone un-responded too.  Any chance of an update, or at
least some information that the various outstanding WF2 issues are
proceeding.

It might be nice to see a complete spec so we can have a call for
implementations - It would be nice if we could have  a spec to
implement against before IE7 is released, so the developers there have
to something to work against...

Jim.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While it may not be in the form of heavy volume posting to the WHATWG

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't recall speed ever being an issue that was raised related to doing

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The WF2 spec is basically done. Implementation work has started.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What?  before a &quot;call for implementation&quot;, that's scary, I understood
</I>&gt;<i> you'd previously argued that this was a bad thing?  The spec is
</I>&gt;<i> clearly not finished, there are big unresolved issues (particularly
</I>&gt;<i> the date fallback and icomplex type proposals)
