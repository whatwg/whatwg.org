I fully support your sentiment, but all this part of the spec is doing 
is more closely matching unavoidable reality. In the current market, 
form control vendors *will* support autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; -- whether it's 
in any spec is completely irrelevant.

It's a prisoners' dilemma that works like this:
1.  Stupid banks and other e-commerce sites (which is a substantial
     proportion of them) think autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; improves their
     security.
2.  If any free-as-in-beer browser implements autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; while
     other browsers do not, these sites will *block the browsers* that do
     not, telling visitors to &quot;upgrade&quot; to the browser that does. (That's
     presumably why Microsoft implemented it in the first place.)
3.  In the absence of collaboration between them, all browser vendors
     are forced to cave and recognize autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;, because not
     being able to save data entered on the site is a much better user
     experience than not being allowed to use the site at all.

So if you want user agents to ignore autocomplete=, your most hopeful 
course of action is to take it up with Microsoft. They are, currently, 
the only UA vendor with enough (relatively) immovable market share to 
de-implement autocomplete=, say &quot;stuff you&quot; to the banks and e-commerce 
sites, and (by sheer weight of users) to force the sites to let them in 
anyway. (Even then, a few would force their customers to use Firefox, 
while others would convert their forms to non-autocompletable Flash, 
Java, or PDF. Yes, that would be stupid, but I already said they were 
stupid. And that's why I said &quot;form control vendors&quot; above, rather than 
&quot;browser vendors&quot;.)

A much longer-term strategy is to continue working toward wide use of 
standards-compliant browsers (and Free plug-ins for Java and Flash that 
implement auto-completion uncompromisingly), and then toward neutering 
any ability for sites to tell what browser you're using. Then sites 
won't be able to tell whether your browser or plug-ins support 
autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; or not, there will be nothing they can do about it, 
and you'll be able to use autocomplete with impunity.
