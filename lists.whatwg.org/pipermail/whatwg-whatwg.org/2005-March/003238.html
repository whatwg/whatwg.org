<PRE>i need to better articulate what i had in mind for a &quot;sensitiveinput&quot;
attribute to form or form elements:

Let's forget about &quot;autocomplete&quot; for a second, and focus on a
different specific feature, which is &quot;saving passwords&quot;.

Today, all browsers ask you whether or not you wish to save passwords
on a given site. If they don't ask you via prompt, they let you
specify it in a preference.

A browser identifies a &quot;password' field through an attribute &quot;type&quot;
whose value is &quot;password&quot;.

If a user has explicitly allowed their browser to save passwords for a
given site, the next time they come back to this input box, their
password will be pre-filled with dots *******.

Now, I would like &quot;sensitiveinput&quot; to be a part of this specific
behavior, enabled based on the exact same preference that governs
password auto-completion. Imagine &quot;sensitiveinput&quot; being just like
making all your sensitive text inputs of type &quot;password&quot;: their
auto-completion behavior mirrors that of passwords, yet their display
isn't as obfuscated.

SO, whenever a user, at any given time, is asked by their browser &quot;do
you wish to remember passwords for this site?&quot;, if they click Yes, the
browser will not only remember passwords for this site, but also all
inputs that are marked with the &quot;sensitiveinput&quot; attribute, on-top of
remembering non-sensitive inputs.

If the user answers &quot;NO&quot;, then the browser will make a point of NOT
remembering passwords and inputs with the &quot;sensitiveinput&quot; attribute.
It may remember other inputs that are not marked &quot;sensitive&quot;.

With all this in mind, the message that today, in most browsers, says
something like &quot;do you wish to remember passwords for this site?&quot;
might be reworded to &quot;do you wish to remember passwords and other
entries of sensitive nature for this site?&quot;.  ... or not ...

Again, i'm not talking about &quot;adding yet another warning for sensitive
inputs&quot;, i'm talking about leveraging an existing warning, and
extending its behavior to a new type of attributes.

With that said, this is all ideal-world speculation, likely not
something that we'll be able to put into a draft or anything, but i
just wanted to at least clarify the idea so it can rear its head back
up should an implementation opportunity arise.
