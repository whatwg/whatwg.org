</I>&gt;<i> So you are acting within WHAT-WG as a representative of Opera, and not

</I>
At the moment there is no practical difference.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Could you explain why not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Because I don't see any way that WHATWG's copyright status is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;urgent&quot;, and I don't see how it could possibly be more important than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any of the other things that Opera's legal team is involved with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From Opera's perspective certainly not, however from WHAT-WG's 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, then all of Operas other stuff is irrelevant - obviously 
</I>&gt;<i> they as wholly independant from the WHAT-WG can take as long as they 
</I>&gt;<i> want, I simply asked for you to request an urgent response under your 
</I>&gt;<i> role as spokesperson for the WHAT-WG work.
</I>
I don't see why Opera lawyers would care about what is urgent in a WHATWG 
context.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you also please request that you are allowed to post their 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; response to the mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; No.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Could you explain why not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This doesn't seem particularly open?
</I>
As far as I can tell, Opera's legal advice is not even remotely covered by 
the WHATWG charter.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; No, I know, I asked you to confirm to me that you did - something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you've still not done - can you confirm to me that the licence given 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to the WHAT-WG and others to use and re-licence Opera copyright 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; material is something you have in writing and would be producible in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any future court case rising from Opera (or future owners of its 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; content) revoking the licence?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, of course I have the license in writing. So do you. It's written 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right at the top of every WHATWG spec, and I even sent it to this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, that is not what I asked, I asked that you had Opera's intention and 
</I>&gt;<i> lawyer advice that the WHAT-WG documents be provided under that licence 
</I>&gt;<i> in writing
</I>
Yes; I copied and pasted the license that is in the draft from an e-mail.


&gt;<i> if you are able to produce that in a court at a future date if Opera (or 
</I>&gt;<i> the future copyright owners) decide to revoke that licence.
</I>
I thought you said that even with the license, it could be revoked? In 
which case how would this be useful?


&gt;<i> &gt; Just for kicks, could you outline how it could become in Opera's best 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interests to prevent whatever it is that revoking this license would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prevent?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any successful product has the ability to make money for the owners of a 
</I>&gt;<i> product in a number of ways, there's lots of ways that ownership of the 
</I>&gt;<i> specification by a single vendor could be used.
</I>
Could you actually explain one?


&gt;<i> &gt; Could you also point me to the relevant part of the equivalent W3C 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licenses that protect you from such license grant revocation when it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comes to W3C specifications?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The W3C doesn't licence such blanket derivative works of its
</I>&gt;<i> specifications, for a very good reason
</I>
So what is it you wanted permission to do then?


&gt;<i> as to the seperate issue of ownership, I believe I'd already explained 
</I>&gt;<i> why a consortium that anyone can join is reasonable protection, whereas 
</I>&gt;<i> a single company in the industry is something to be more concerned with.
</I>
Anyone can join WHATWG. WHATWG contributors are equivalent to W3C members 
in terms of status. W3C _team_ membership, which is equivalent to WHATWG 
membership, is most certainly _not_ open to anyone.
