What if a feature from WF2 is not implementable in IE6?

I'm concerned about file upload. I'm not sure its possible to upload 
files in other ways than using the &quot;native&quot; form-submission, which is 
always multipart/form-data and POST. This means that you cannot include 
file upload in xml-encoding, or with PUT in any encoding, and you cannot 
support single-file upload with arbitrary content-types.

I may be wrong though, since some people is able to make IE do the 
impossible. In this case, however, it might be considered a security 
problem if someone were able to tamper with file upload, and the we run 
the risk of it being fixed in an update :-)
