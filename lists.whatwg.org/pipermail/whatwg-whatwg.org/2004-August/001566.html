    So you're using the WF2 spec to defeat a suggestion for the WF2 
spec?  Hmm...

    If there's going to be an implicit default value, how to determine 
that value must be defined in the spec. Otherwise, the webmaster will 
never know what to expect the value of the slider to be. If users 
typically don't even change the value of the &quot;range&quot; control, you could 
have different values for that control purely based on what UA the user has.

    I really don't know how you'd enforce the requirement of a default 
value, though. Look at |alt| attributes. They're required, yet how often 
do webmasters not include this property? I suspect most UAs will simply 
violate such a restriction.
