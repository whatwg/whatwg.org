    Is incremental rendering really possible for XHTML? For give my 
ignorance, but I was under the impression that according to 
specification an XHTML document has to validate entirely before being 
displayed. If that's the case, a compliant application can't start 
loading the document until the entire file is transferred. Isn't Mozilla 
simply sticking to the letter of the spec?

&gt;&gt;<i>And note that SVG and XForms are in exactly the same problem space as Web

</I>
    There has a &quot;Requirements and ideas&quot; section that outlines the 
problem space of Web Apps 1.0 for months, and development of the draft 
is currently in full swing. I fail to see how members of the SVG and 
XForms work groups couldn't at least get an idea of what WA1 does.

</I>&gt;<i> Of course XHTML is, IE6 is the best XHTML browser IMO, it renders it

</I>&gt;<i> (although I've got a feeling it's not even possible in the current
</I>&gt;<i> releases.)
</I>
    As I explained before, it is my understanding that a compliant XHTML 
renderer will not display a page with invalid markup. IE6 is so &quot;good&quot; 
at rendering XHTML because it does not parse or render it as XHTML at 
all. Effectively, you're saying that Mozilla would be so much better if 
it rendered XHTML as tag soup.
