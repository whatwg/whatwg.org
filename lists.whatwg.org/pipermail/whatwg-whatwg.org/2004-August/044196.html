Where?


&gt;<i> see just about any RFC for common use. If you don't denote them somehow, 
</I>&gt;<i> people will be confused about which statements are normative (see last 
</I>&gt;<i> comment in this mail).
</I>
Every use of those terms in normative sections of the spec are occurances 
of RFC2119 terms. It shouldn't be that confusing.


&gt;<i> Some W3C specs that didn't want to use uppercase terms have made them 
</I>&gt;<i> links back to the &quot;notational conventions&quot; section, which in turn points 
</I>&gt;<i> to RFC2119.
</I>
I have considered doing that (for a while I was thinking of making them 
small-caps in an alternate stylesheet, too) but it would make editing the 
document significantly harder and is not really worth it IMHO.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * 2.1 Extensions to the input element, last paragraph -- &quot;The size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; attribute of the input element is deprecated in favour of using CSS to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; specify the layout of the form.&quot; This approach isn't used elsewhere
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (i.e., AFAICT, other similar situations don't result in deprecation).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not aware of any similar situations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.4 &quot;The rows and cols attributes of the  textarea element are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> required attributes.&quot;
</I>
This isn't a similar situation. The &quot;rows&quot; and &quot;cols&quot; attributes aren't 
presentational, they give the wrapping edge of the textarea, which 
affects submission. These attributes shouldn't be deprecated.

They are made optional because I couldn't see any reason for them to be 
required -- I've often needed to omit them, e.g. when there was no 
wrapping involved.


&gt;<i> 2.6 &quot;The form element's action attribute is no longer a required 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute. If omitted, the default value is the empty string, which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> relative URI pointing at the current document (or the specified base 
</I>&gt;<i> URI, if any).&quot;
</I>
Again, this isn't a presentational attribute, it's just that there are 
several cases where the action attribute is just unnecessary.


&gt;<i> Elsewhere, you just loosen requirements, whereas size is deprecated.
</I>
IMHO, those situations aren't similar.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * 2.16 Handling unexpected elements and values, last paragraph -- 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; How should this be tested? Seems like a recipe for interoperability 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure which paragraph you are referring to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Other invalid cases should be handled analogously.&quot;
</I>
Oh, ok. I don't see how to define the other cases any other way, really. 
What would you suggest instead? Removing it wouldn't be any better for 
interoperability.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't have a strong preference here, but the issues may be subtle. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In the event that the current approach is kept, it should be made 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; explicit that the actual method remains what is specified, rather 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; than changing to GET, so that no information is lost.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not sure what you mean by this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My concern is that if someone uses an extension method (e.g., &quot;PATCH&quot;) 
</I>&gt;<i> with a form, the information that it is &quot;PATCH&quot; instead of &quot;GET&quot; will 
</I>&gt;<i> get lost in the request. I understand that you need to have a default 
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour for unknown methods, but the current text *could* be read as 
</I>&gt;<i> saying that when you default to GET, the method gets changed to GET too. 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be bad.
</I>
I'm not really sure I understand. Could you give an example, or quote the 
exact sentence in the spec that you think should change?

If someone says &lt;form method=&quot;patch&quot;&gt;, and the UA does not support another 
specification or vendor extension that modifies the behaviour for this 
method, then for the purposes of submission, it is treated as &quot;get&quot;. 
However, nowhere (as far as I can tell) does it say that the DOM is 
affected by this defaulting.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * 5.6 Submitting the encoded form data set -- &quot;resource is fetched&quot; --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;representation is fetched&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;representation&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#information-resource">http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#information-resource</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't fetch a resource; you fetch a representation (you can, 
</I>&gt;<i> however, dereference a resource).
</I>
With all due respect to the authors of the webarch document, the term 
&quot;representation&quot; is rather confusing and would not, IMHO, lead to a very 
readable document.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * 6.2 Seeding a form with initial values -- it's not good practice to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; put a requirement (&quot;should not&quot;) in a note.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not a requirement, since it is in a note. It's just advice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe it should be made normative, though. Any preference?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See first comment in this mail; I'm not sure what's normative.
</I>
As it says in section 1.6: &quot;Diagrams, examples, and notes are 
non-normative. All other content in this specification is normative.&quot;
