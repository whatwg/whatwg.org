If you recall it correctly?  Surely you can just look at the document

lawyers I assume, we're not just relying on a conversation are we?

As you just said above, you're not a lawyer...  and I certainly have
no idea about Norwegian law, but certainly in US law it's not possible
to give a licence that cannot be revoked. (
<A HREF="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#203</A> )  So I think I am
right to be concerned, could you be clearer about exactly the advice
the lawyers gave you, I find it rather surprsing that after 2 months
lawyers have come back with 1 sentance, I've never seen a lawyer write
so little.

&gt;<i> No news on patent stuff yet.

Why not?  What's happening, why the delay? - how is Dave Hyatt coming
along with his questions to Apple?

Jim.
