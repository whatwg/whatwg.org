<PRE>
I just added a first shot at a section for doing tabs in the Web Apps 
draft. It is probably not perfect, comments welcome.

I tried to take into account the various comments that were made on this 
list regarding tabs, including this e-mail from Matthew:

</I>&gt;<i> We've seen similar demos. You will note that this specific one doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> encountered by webmasters. Here's a list of problems with the current 
</I>&gt;<i> system regarding tabs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Inconsistent Standards Support
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This wouldn't be such a problem if we were talking about a single 
</I>&gt;<i> standard, but a tabbed control that performs in the same way as the 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent OS widgets requires HTML, CSS and Javascript. This makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> very easy to write a tabbed control that breaks on a specific browser or 
</I>&gt;<i> in a specific configuration.
</I>
The proposed solution is just an HTML element, so it should address this.


&gt;<i> 2) High Learning Curve
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The creation of tabbed controls requires specific use of multiple web 
</I>&gt;<i> standards that some may not be able to cope with or may not find it 
</I>&gt;<i> worth the effort. This places the use of tabs out of reach for amateur 
</I>&gt;<i> or hobbiest webmasters.
</I>
Since it's just HTML here, that should be resolved.


&gt;<i> 3) Lack of Encapsulation
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Current solutions do not take the form of objects. Therefore, one 
</I>&gt;<i> typically has to edit the source files used to create a widget in order 
</I>&gt;<i> to style it. For those who may be using source they didn't write, this 
</I>&gt;<i> could be disastrous for obvious reasons.
</I>
Unfortunately, there is no way to style the proposed widget. However, XBL 
would be the way to do it on the long run.
