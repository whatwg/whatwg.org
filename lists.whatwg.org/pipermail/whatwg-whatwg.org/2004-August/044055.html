I thought the process was open, and the only communication method was
the mailing list - but we've gone over this...

&gt;<i> &gt; As I've said before, I do not feel HTC's are an appropriate mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for providing this sort of support in a release environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody is forcing you to use HTCs. :-) Just don't stop anyone else from

</I>
I'm not, you're rejecting the built in extension mechanisms of HTML,
because of dubious requirements about HTC's.  This is my problem. 
There's still a reason to use HTC's with the object solution, it's
just not obvious with OBJECT in your examples.

&gt;<i> &gt; So it's the expectation of the WHAT-WG that users of Mozilla, Safari and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Opera will get a severely degraded experience unless they upgrade their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsers?  Well as I said before - it's one way to drive Opera sales.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oddly enough, Opera, Mozilla and Apple do not think it is unusual for them
</I>&gt;<i> to add new features to their products and hope that existing users of
</I>&gt;<i> previous version of those products upgrade to the new releases. In fact,
</I>&gt;<i> when we researched this, we discovered it was standard industry practice,
</I>&gt;<i> and a good way to stay in business.
</I>
So it is to drive Opera sales?    

&gt;<i> We wouldn't really have to worry about back-compat at all if it wasn't for
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft stalling IE development, 
</I>
I got upgrades to IE just last week, I saw lots of jobs on the IE team
advertised last week - in fact they're recruiting more than Opera -
doesn't look stalled to me - so what's the point of worrying about it
now?

Jim.
