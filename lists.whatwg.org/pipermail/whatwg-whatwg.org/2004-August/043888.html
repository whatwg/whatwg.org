</I>
I guess I don't know what you mean then. Could you give detailed examples?


&gt;<i> I would ask you to compare Web/doc navigation with the data-entry

</I>
I am not familiar enough with these systems to understand how the 
navigation in such systems differs from the navigation in HTML. Could you 
describe some cases for us?


&gt;&gt;<i> In general I think the separation of &quot;data&quot; from &quot;code&quot; -- the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separation of &quot;document&quot; from &quot;application&quot; -- is a concept that has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been outgrown
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In implementation terms that may be so, but in terms of modalities it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not. Support for common modalities is what users need, whether those 
</I>&gt;<i> modalities are drawn from non-computer idioms or constructed from 
</I>&gt;<i> perceptions of how computers work. Both &quot;document&quot; and &quot;app&quot; are well 
</I>&gt;<i> established idiomatic uses of particular software. A page that happens 
</I>&gt;<i> to blend those two is either failing to be either or attempting to 
</I>&gt;<i> develop a new modality. Any new modality assumedly is better in some 
</I>&gt;<i> way, which is ... ?
</I>
You're assuming users understand the application/document duality. In my 
experience, this isn't the case. The way in which the &quot;new&quot; modality is 
better than the &quot;old&quot; one is that it is, IMHO, closer to the mental model 
that most non-experts have.


&gt;<i> The brain-effort required to absorb a page/window whose structure is 
</I>&gt;<i> hinted at by graphical layout is greater than the brain effort required 
</I>&gt;<i> to navigate a page/window that has fixed and reliable structural aspects 
</I>&gt;<i> that a user can recite from memory or habit (like OS look'n'feel + 
</I>&gt;<i> useability guidelines). That is just a consequence of the cost of visual 
</I>&gt;<i> processing by the brain.
</I>
Sure.


&gt;<i> If you're a frequent Amazon user, you can learn some of the layout 
</I>&gt;<i> specific to that site. That will speed you up a bit. It won't speed up 
</I>&gt;<i> your general Web use - every app is layed out differently - and it won't 
</I>&gt;<i> speed up your use to optimal keyboard speed. That is the case behind the 
</I>&gt;<i> success of the Mozilla Amazon Browser app, and the argument for modality 
</I>&gt;<i> support in the absence of a single canonical Web page look and feel.
</I>
Ok...


&gt;<i> For HTML, the hope would be that when an app developer want to support 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;highest gear&quot; navigation speed, then such pages could be easily 
</I>&gt;<i> constructed without those other problems.
</I>
Absolutely. However, beyond providing Web application authors with richer 
widget sets, what can one really do? The &quot;highest gear&quot; is quite different 
from platform to platform (for example Ok/Cancel buttons are in a 
different order on Mac than on Windows), are you saying we should extend 
HTML to the point of being so abstract as a UI language that HTML apps can 
easily be styled into a platform-compliant application?

I have no idea how to even approach that, if so.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The web bolt-on technique of &quot;breadcrumbing&quot; is an example of how 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; HTML is encumbered by lack of fast navigation techniques. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; no breadcrumbs in WinZip or in MYOB/GnuCash/QuickBooks (for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; example), and no need for them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really see that there is a need for HTML-based applications of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that type either. GMail for example has no breadcrumbs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that's an ambitious statement at least. Those apps are in none of 
</I>&gt;<i> the classes dropped from consideration so far. Most Internet banking 
</I>&gt;<i> sites are proto-examples of such apps.
</I>
Internet banking sites don't need breadcrumbs either. I'm not really sure 
what, at the concrete level, you are suggesting.
