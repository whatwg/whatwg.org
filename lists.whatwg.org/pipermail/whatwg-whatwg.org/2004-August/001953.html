Well, we want to be able to do both, really. Have Web applications run 
inside browser chrome, and also have Web applications run as first-class 
applications. The latter would of course only be allowed if the user said 
that he trusted the site, and so forth, e.g. after being explose to a Web 
page that said:

&gt;<i> Therefore, I suggest the &lt;menubar&gt; element be renamed to &lt;menulist&gt;, to

</I>&gt;<i> vertically by default.
</I>
Here is where I ran into trouble.

Take:

&lt;menubar&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;#file&quot;&gt;File&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;menu id=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;fnew()&quot;&gt;New...&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;fopen()&quot;&gt;Open...&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;fsave()&quot; id=&quot;save&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;fsaveas()&quot;&gt;Save as...&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;/menu&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;#edit&quot;&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;menu id=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;ecopy()&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;ecut()&quot;&gt;Cut&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;epaste()&quot;&gt;Paste&lt;/button&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;/menu&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/menubar&gt;

In a legacy UA, that's going to have links before each menu, which is 
pretty ugly.

In WA1 UAs, according to the draft, it's going to just be a list with two 
&quot;menu links&quot;, links that have been styled specially, and which trigger the 
menus when activated.

Last time I thought of this I considered that maybe instead of &lt;a&gt; we 
should use &lt;menulabel&gt;. But I'm still not convinced the whole &lt;menubar&gt; 
(or &lt;menulist&gt; or whatever) rendering model is sound.

One of the problems at the moment is that the menu will be different if it 
is interpreted &quot;natively&quot; or if it is rendered just using CSS. For 
example, this menu bar/list/whatever:

   &lt;menulist&gt;
     &lt;menu label=&quot;File&quot;&gt;
       &lt;command label=&quot;Save&quot; ...&gt;
       &lt;command label=&quot;Save As...&quot; ...&gt;
     &lt;/menu&gt;
     &lt;menu label=&quot;Edit&quot;&gt;
       &lt;command label=&quot;Cut&quot; ...&gt;
       &lt;command label=&quot;Copy&quot; ...&gt;
     &lt;/menu&gt;
   &lt;/menulist&gt;

...would work fine if handled natively -- but the CSS version would show 
nothing at all.


&gt;<i> That would suit the usual use case for adjacent menus, and would avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> wrongly implying that it should look like a native menu bar. Authors 
</I>&gt;<i> wanting horizontally adjacent menus could get them without extra styling 
</I>&gt;<i> just by using adjacent &lt;menu&gt;s, without a &lt;menulist&gt; element. (Outside a 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;menulist&gt;, UAs could present a &lt;menu&gt; as a button with a 
</I>&gt;<i> downward-pointing triangle at the end of it, just like native standalone 
</I>&gt;<i> pull-down menus. This would both advertise their menu-ness, and avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> the confusion of them looking like a native menu bar.)
</I>
This isn't what authors want, based on what you see on sites today.


&gt;<i> &gt; There have been a lot of requests for nested OPTGROUPs, so I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking maybe we should just allow them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nested submenus are less evil (though still HIG-contraveningly horrible) in
</I>&gt;<i> pull-down menus (e.g. &lt;menu&gt;) than they are in option menus (e.g. &lt;select&gt;),
</I>&gt;<i> because at least in pull-down menus a particular submenu item is usually in
</I>&gt;<i> the same direction relative to its parent item. (This isn't *always* true on
</I>&gt;<i> platforms that put menu bars inside windows, because the position of the
</I>&gt;<i> window may force a menu or submenu to open *sometimes* to the north and/or
</I>&gt;<i> west instead of the southeast.)
</I>
Nested optgroups don't imply submenus. Just more indented options with 
headers.


&gt;<i> Another reason not to have &lt;optgroup&gt;s inside &lt;select&gt;s is that option 
</I>&gt;<i> menus are supposed to show their state even when closed, but they cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> do so reliably if two or more submenus contain items with the same text. 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the distinction between the towns of &quot;Australia&quot; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Palmerston&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; &gt; &quot;Palmerston&quot; would be obvious if a tree 
</I>&gt;<i> control was used, or if two &lt;select&gt;s were used; but the distinction 
</I>&gt;<i> could not be shown in a single native-looking option menu while the menu 
</I>&gt;<i> was closed, without making the menu abnormally wide.
</I>
HTML4 already allows for this, by having two labels, one for the full case 
and one for the short case.
