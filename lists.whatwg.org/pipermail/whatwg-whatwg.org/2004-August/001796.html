&quot;input&quot; conveys that the data is a single field of data input.

&quot;object&quot; conveys that the data is from an external resource.

What we want here is a single field of data input, not an external 
resource.

The &quot;sensible new model&quot; is presumably XForms.

If it wasn't for IE, we wouldn't have to even _consider_ abusing &lt;object&gt;, 
so I don't really see your point here anyway.


&gt;&gt;<i> But I do agree that the more traditional HTML-like approach would have

</I>
One possibility that has been risen (and which will be considered to WF3 
once we have more experience with the datetime controls in WF2) is to use 
a new element for the date/time controls. That would be preferable to the 
&lt;object&gt; solution.

But we shouldn't try to solve problems that aren't obviously problems. It 
isn't clear to me that the current date/time fields have inadequate 
fallback; I've found plenty of occurances of exactly the same UI in 
current forms, where it isn't fallback but intentional.
