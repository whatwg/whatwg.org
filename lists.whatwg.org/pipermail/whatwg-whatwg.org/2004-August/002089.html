So that has changed from the previous situation where you made it very
clear you were doing this as an individual.

&gt;<i> I don't see why Opera lawyers would care about what is urgent in a WHATWG

</I>
no, but you could still ask for an urgent response, then it would be
up to Opera if they decided it was a priority or not, I would hope
Opera would acknowledge the importance of the WHAT-WG and respond
accordingly.
&gt;<i> &gt; This doesn't seem particularly open?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, Opera's legal advice is not even remotely covered by
</I>&gt;<i> the WHATWG charter.
</I>
Nope, I was just making an observation.

&gt;<i> &gt; No, that is not what I asked, I asked that you had Opera's intention and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lawyer advice that the WHAT-WG documents be provided under that licence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in writing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes; I copied and pasted the license that is in the draft from an e-mail.
</I>
Could you please ensure that the email is appropriately archived and
would be available to a court for anyone who requested it?  Perhaps
register it with some 3rd party?

&gt;<i> &gt; if you are able to produce that in a court at a future date if Opera (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the future copyright owners) decide to revoke that licence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought you said that even with the license, it could be revoked? In
</I>&gt;<i> which case how would this be useful?
</I>
Any revokation would likely result in a court case, hence the reason
to ensure that documents are available.

&gt;<i> &gt; as to the seperate issue of ownership, I believe I'd already explained
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why a consortium that anyone can join is reasonable protection, whereas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a single company in the industry is something to be more concerned with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone can join WHATWG. WHATWG contributors are equivalent to W3C members
</I>&gt;<i> in terms of status. W3C _team_ membership, which is equivalent to WHATWG
</I>&gt;<i> membership, is most certainly _not_ open to anyone.
</I>
I think this is highly misleading, TEAM membership is nothing like
WHAT-WG membership - the WHAT-WG members have the power to choose what
enters a specification and when a specification is complete etc.  the
W3C team do not, the final arbiter is the AC reps - all member company
representatives (if we ignore the director for now)  Also the W3C's
structure limits its actions by nature of US laws AIUI.

Jim.
