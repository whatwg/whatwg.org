No, you are just as capable of reading the archives as I am.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; It really isn't. It's just a bunch of pretty simple regexps and some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; simple maths.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1.091574000e+12
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Massaging all of those (well perhaps not the last) into the date
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; intended by the user, is not simple, it's a lot more complicated than,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; just taking the date/month/year from the 3 input controls on most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; international forms today.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not trivial, sure. But it's still pretty simple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Point me to a library then... any language...
</I>
See the &quot;parseDateTime&quot; function at the bottom of:

   <A HREF="http://whatwg.org/demos/date-01/test-source">http://whatwg.org/demos/date-01/test-source</A>


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; No, it's not - that may be the common case for when you first enter a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; form, but even those forms upon an invalid response in it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; repopulate the form with the invalid data.  This makes the approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; unworkable for me, as after a validation failure I cannot leave the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; user value in there.  Quite apart from it failing in all the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cases where authors wish to set up a value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I maintain that it _is_ the common case. In the 50 or so pages with forms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I looked at yesterday, only about 2 had an initial value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You appear to be confusing my point - common here, I'm obviously very
</I>&gt;<i> poor at getting them across.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Upon submission of a form, that results in a validation error, or other 
</I>&gt;<i> reason to return to the page (perhaps a &quot;choose a new destination on a 
</I>&gt;<i> flight map&quot;) develepors populate the form with the previous entry - this 
</I>&gt;<i> is the initial value problem, it does not mean that on first entry pages 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily have a default value.
</I>
If you have received an invalid value, you know it is a non-WF2 UA. You 
can thus write whatever markup you want to handle the non-WF2 UA.


&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I have. Just check if &quot;input.type&quot; is equal to &quot;datetime&quot; (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever type you are checking for).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've already demonstrated UA's that do not do this the last time you
</I>&gt;<i> suggested it as the solution.  Please try again...
</I>
I just tested this again, and all the UAs I tested, did this fine:

   <A HREF="http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/html/forms/005.html">http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/html/forms/005.html</A>

Since this is required behaviour by the specs, that's good enough for me.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why bother, when we already have an HTML 4 compatible way of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; achieving this (OBJECT) which is only being rejected not because it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't degrade on IE, but because it does!  That really seems a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ridiculous reason to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea is to implement these features in IE. That's a requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understood the requirement to be degradeable in downlevel browsers 
</I>&gt;<i> including the ability to provide more enhanced fallback of the new 
</I>&gt;<i> features, via both browser plugins and scripting in UA's such as 
</I>&gt;<i> Internet explorer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I did not understand it to mean, is that the implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> the features in IE (what does that mean by the way, which versions
</I>&gt;<i> platforms etc.  Could you clarify the design goals, if they're not
</I>&gt;<i> what my first paragraph gives) were dependant on a particular
</I>&gt;<i> methodology.
</I>
Windows IE6.
