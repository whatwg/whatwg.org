I am told modern systems do, now.

I don't know, should they?


&gt;<i> &gt; 2.12. The autocomplete attribute
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this has to exist for banks with weak authentication, high paranoia

</I>
Yeah.


&gt;<i> Over here (Finland) we use OTP authentication for banking.
</I>
Norway does too.


&gt;<i> &gt; To prevent an attribute from being processed in this way, put a non-breaking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; zero-width space character (&amp;#xFEFF;) at the start of the attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't the use of that char as anything but the BOM deprecated or at least
</I>&gt;<i> considered harmful?
</I>
Arguably, it _is_ a BOM here.

I'm not overly fond of this either, but it's the only solution I could 
find that was relatively harmless (the BOM can always be dropped at the 
start of strings) and yet did the job. Better suggestions are welcome 
though.


&gt;<i> &gt; Since square brackets are not allowed in ID attributes in XML, the above
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example cannot validate to an XML DTD. It is still well-formed, however, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conformant to this specification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can DOM implementations that know about IDness be trusted not to barf when
</I>&gt;<i> creating id attributes with non-ID values?
</I>
Pretty much:

   <A HREF="http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/core/015-demo.xml">http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/core/015-demo.xml</A>

The results aren't perfectly interoperable, but they are close, and more 
importantly, seem sane.


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that a string containing the codepoint's value itself (for example, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; six-character string &quot;U+263A&quot; or the seven-character string &quot;&amp;#9786;&quot;) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not considered to be human readable and must not be used as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transliteration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you expect UAs that already do this change their behavior with the legacy
</I>&gt;<i> submission types?
</I>
We can hope.


&gt;<i> &gt;       How a UA establishes the page's character encoding is determined by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the language specification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> s/language/markup language/ to avoid confusion with natural language metadata.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> &gt; which has a root element named &quot;submission&quot;, with no prefix, defining a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default namespace uuid:d10e4fd6-2c01-49e8-8f9d-0ab964387e32.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that is an inappropriate attempt to micromanage the syntactic details
</I>&gt;<i> that are in the realm of a lower-level spec. I think the submission format
</I>&gt;<i> should either allow all the syntactic sugar that comes with Namespaces in XML
</I>&gt;<i> or be layered directly on top XML 1.0 without namespace support.
</I>
The reason it is micromanaged is to make it possible to use either a pure 
XML 1.0 parser _or_ an XML 1.0 with namespaces parser on the server side 
without getting into any complications.


&gt;<i> &gt; UAs must not include an XML declaration
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, a higher-level spec should not attempt to restrict the syntactic
</I>&gt;<i> variance allowed by a lower-level spec. The XML declaration is allowed by the
</I>&gt;<i> XML spec.
</I>
I can't really think of a good argument for keeping this restriction, so 
I've removed it.


&gt;<i> &gt; but must include a BOM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that is not a legitimate requirement when UTF-8 is used.
</I>
Why not?


&gt;<i> &gt; UAs may use either CDATA blocks, entities, or both in escaping the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contents of attributes and elements, as appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In order not to imply that this spec could restrict the ways characters 
</I>&gt;<i> are escaped, that sentence should be a note rather than part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> normative prose. (Of course, only the pre-defined entities are 
</I>&gt;<i> available. Then there are NCRs.)
</I>
This spec _could_ restrict the ways characters are escaped. It needs to 
not be a note so that the &quot;may&quot; has normative value. No?


&gt;&gt;<i> The resulting XML must be a well-formed XML instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it is not well-formed, it, by definition, is not &quot;resulting XML&quot;. :-)
</I>
That is a meaningless distinction IMHO. For sanity's sake, one has to 
consider anything labelled as XML to be XML, otherwise we can't then say 
that it is &quot;ill-formed XML&quot; when it is wrong. To put it another way -- if 
it isn't XML, then the XML processing rules don't apply, and UAs can 
suddenly do whatever they like since there is no longer a spec defining 
what they should do.


&gt;<i> &gt; The only mention of namespaces in the submission document must be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; declaration of the default namespace on the root element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See above.
</I>
See above. :-)
