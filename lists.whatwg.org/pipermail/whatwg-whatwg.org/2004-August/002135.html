This is a conceptually bad idea because it alters the defined semantics
of &lt;hn&gt; elements and combines it with XHTML2-style, structured headings.
  Doing this essentially says that h1 to h6 are exactly the same, which
they are not.  While I'd support the addition of &lt;section&gt; elements, I
do not support altering the semantics of existing elements.  If
&lt;section&gt; were introduced for the purpose of structuring a document,
than an &lt;h&gt; element should also be introduced for the headings.  But, I
believe that would not be backwards compatible with IE, as it be
ignored, and unstylable like every other new element when served as
text/html.

If you really want *numbered* heading levels to be determined by their
structure level, I'd prefer it be done using numbered sections, similar
to the numbered divs found in the ISO HTML [1] because at least that
preserves the semantics of the hn elements.  But, I also don't think
that's a good idea because it adds too many extra elements, which will
not be understood, nor used correctly by anyone.  It may also make 
documents more difficult to maintain.  So, personally, I think the 
semantics of &lt;hn&gt; elements should not be changed, but that doesn't mean 
&lt;section&gt; can't be introduced.

&gt;<i> The most obvious  use case I have in mind would be a UA hiding certian 
</I>&gt;<i> sections of the page so that the content was easilly accessible. It

</I>
I would not support a &lt;chrome&gt; element because that is the term often
used to refer to the application interface styles, and has absolutely
nothing to do with being a sectoin.

&gt;<i> to denote a section of the page other than the main content. One could then 
</I>&gt;<i> subdivide using an attribute (&lt;chrome type=&quot;header&quot;&gt; &lt;chrome 
</I>&gt;<i> type=&quot;footer&quot;&gt; and so on).
</I>
DO NOT overload the type attribute any more than it already is.  We had 
this discussion a few months ago when I was paying more attention to 
this work, and several people were suggesting the use of type for 
various things.  The type attrubue *SHOULD* only be used for denothing 
the MIME type of a resource, and for form controls.  HTML4 already 
overloaded the attrbute with 10 different uses; 8 of them being 
presentational, and thus deprecated.

&gt;&gt;<i> We'll probably keep it to a minimum though. The idea is just to relieve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the most common pseudo-semantic uses of &lt;div&gt;. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally we could get a large sample of actual sites to find out what the

</I>&gt;<i> would  allow one to spider (part of!) the web and extract the classnames 
</I>&gt;<i> given to &lt;div&gt; elements?
</I>
Andy Clarke did a study a few months back on the most common section 
ids, to determine what a general site consists of, and published his 
results [2 - 4].  Maybe that could help with determining semantics for 
new elements.
