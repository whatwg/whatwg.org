File upload controls should never be stylable. If they were stylable, it 
would be too easy to trick users into uploading private files, by making 
them think they were normal text fields, for example.


&gt;<i> Also, as I read the current draft spec (correct me if I'm wrong), but it

</I>&gt;<i> files to upload per file upload control. Does this mean that for

</I>&gt;<i> buttons for 3 file uploads and that each of those must be (validation
</I>&gt;<i> built-in?) filled out with a proper file path to an existing file?
</I>
No, it would just let the user pick three files using the Browse button.


&gt;<i> I would think that the validation should be an option that could be 
</I>&gt;<i> toggled on and off and when it is &quot;OFF&quot; that it is not required that you 
</I>&gt;<i> must have 3 files attached and that the user could specify only 1 if 
</I>&gt;<i> they wanted to. If I have this right, the way the draft spec is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently written you'd be improving on the control (allowing more files 
</I>&gt;<i> to be selected/uploaded per upload control) while causing a bit of 
</I>&gt;<i> undesired functionality (once the number of files is specified THAT many 
</I>&gt;<i> files are required to be entered) at the same time.
</I>
You can specify a minimum number and a maximum number.

Cheers,
