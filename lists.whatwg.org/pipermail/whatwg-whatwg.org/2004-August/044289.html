</I>
What?  could you describe an actual use case situation here, that
makes this relevant?  (ie a table that semantically is more than one
form, and this isn't even a use case, it's a constraint brought about
from other use cases perhaps - but which ones?)
 
&gt;<i>   * Prefilling fields that are not contiguous from two different files
</I>&gt;<i>     (as in:
</I>&gt;<i>        English [ ............ ]
</I>&gt;<i>        Norwegian [ ...........]
</I>&gt;<i>        English [ ............ ]
</I>&gt;<i>        Norwegian [ ...........]
</I>&gt;<i>     ...where the English fields are one form, and the Norwegian fields
</I>&gt;<i>     are another.)
</I>
Could you explain more what you mean here - what does &quot;prefilling
fields&quot; and &quot;from two different files&quot; mean.
 
&gt;<i>   * Having subforms, where you have, e.g., one form covering most of the
</I>&gt;<i>     page, and then little forms within it.
</I>
could you again explain more about this in terms of a use case, it
seems like you've gone from the feature to justify it.   Use cases
involve uses, not functionality.

&gt;<i>   * Being able to predefine the form submission URIs at the top of the
</I>&gt;<i>     page and then using them without having to think about what form an
</I>&gt;<i>     element is in.
</I>
I'm getting even more confused now...  how does having forms not a
member of their containing form element allow you to &quot;not think about
form an element is in&quot; it seems to me that it makes it absolutely
explicit that you know what form an element is in - since you have to
add it to the element.  I'm obviously mis-understanding.

Can I ask again for some use cases - those that made you decide &quot;right
the solution to that is having form elements in different forms&quot; -
rather than ones that you seem to have made up given the premise that
such things exist.   Or at the very least expand these so I can
understand them.

Cheers,

Jim.
