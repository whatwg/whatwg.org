I agree with everything in Henri's e-mail explaining why spec-mandated 
DOCTYPE-triggered mode switching makes no sense.

</I>
Indeed. And DOCTYPEs are basically optional -- in XML, everything has to 
be based off namespaces.

It should also be possible to construct a DOM tree &quot;by hand&quot; using the DOM 
and have the exact same rendering as if the DOM tree was obtained by 
parsing a document.


&gt;<i> &gt; In the long run, it *may* be the case that treating XHTML as tag soup is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only &quot;serious&quot; way of doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WHAT WG should not try to push things to that direction.
</I>
Indeed. And I disagree that treating XHTML as tag soup would ever be the 
right way to do it -- if that is what people want, they should use HTML, 
which is already at that stage.

XML has well-defined parsing rules. There's no reason not to follow them.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The reason why it is bogus is that including a DTD by reference and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; pasting it inline are supposed to be equivalent for validating XML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; processor and in the latter case you don't see a public identifier for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; DTD. Hence, using the public identifier for any purpose other than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; locating the DTD is just plain wrong. Of course, sane real-world XHTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; user agents use non-validating XML processors which makes the inclusion of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the doctype declaration rather pointless.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So do any real-world XHTML UAs handle a DTD pasted inline, or is this just a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; theoretical argument?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mozilla processes the internal DTD subset, but that was not my point.
</I>
UAs must, per XML, handle internal subsets.


&gt;<i> My point was that if you have
</I>&gt;<i> #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> you should not bind any black magic to the name foo.h, because it should be
</I>&gt;<i> permissible to paste the contents of foo.h inline or copy the contents of
</I>&gt;<i> foo.h to bar.h and say
</I>&gt;<i> #include &quot;bar.h&quot;
</I>
Indeed.


&gt;<i> However, considering that as a Web author you cannot trust that everyone
</I>&gt;<i> parsing your pages uses an XML processor that resolves external entities,
</I>&gt;<i> including a doctype in XML intended for the Web is mostly pointless and often
</I>&gt;<i> done out of a cargo cultish habit.
</I>
Hear hear. This is one of the many reasons that WHATWG specs actually 
subtly discourage the use of DOCTYPEs.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Now, similar argumentation does not work on the HTML side if we agree not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to pretend that real SGML is being processed. Doctype sniffing is a tag
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; soup solution to a tag soup problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's an extrapolation from a single data point. The only use of doctype
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sniffing *so far* has been to handle quirky style/layout expectations of old
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pages (and in the case of table style inheritance, they wouldn't even need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be tag-soup pages). In the long run, doctype sniffing may become a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general-purpose method of changing *any* undesired behavior (whether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; de-facto or de-jure) of old syntax in new spec versions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doctype sniffing was devised after the HTML 4 and CSS2 specs had been written
</I>&gt;<i> as a heuristic to distinguish legacy documents from documents whose authors
</I>&gt;<i> might expect conforming behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The circumstances and requirements that led to doctype sniffing were different
</I>&gt;<i> from the circumstances and requirements for specs that have not yet been
</I>&gt;<i> finalized. With WF2 there is no need to come up with an extension to an old
</I>&gt;<i> heuristic. Now that the issue has been raised in the speccing phase we can
</I>&gt;<i> have a more explicit incantation. For example: &lt;meta
</I>&gt;<i> name=&quot;mpt-approved-radio-buttons&quot; content=&quot;true&quot;&gt; or &lt;meta
</I>&gt;<i> name=&quot;what-wg-behavior&quot; content=&quot;do-the-right-thing&quot;&gt;
</I>
Exactly. DOCTYPE sniffing was always meant to be a heuristic; a way of 
detecting whether the page author had written the page before or after 
browsers started seriously looking at spec compliance.
