but it's clear from this mailing list that this is an issue that the
WHAT-WG wants resolved (it's not just me who's asked about it)  So I
see no reason why it should, you're just the spokesman here.

A derivative work that defined Opera's implementation as
non-conformant, resulting.

</I>
Me,  I don't want permission to do anything right now, I just wanted
clarification of why a WHAT-WG specification is copyright a single
vendor, because I believe that limits the options of what could be
done - I don't want an open licence etc. I want it to be owned by
someone, I just don't want that someone to be a public company - I'd
much rather it was copyright Ian Hickson as an individual because I
believe that to be more trustworty than a company that could be bought
at any time.

Of course so could you,  but I believe that risk is less.

The reason I supported the placing of it in the PD was that subsequent
work could then be copyright the WHAT-WG, not because I wanted it to
be forever Public Domain.

Jim.
