    That's _presentational_ mutual exclusion. I fail to see how that 
amounts to _semantic_ mutual exclusion.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      &lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;/tabbox&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Quick note: I have to say, I don't like the header tags being treated as

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's not straight-forward about this?
</I>
    Well, for starters, exactly how would someone unfamiliar with HTML5 
know that the &lt;h1&gt; element contains the name of the tab for that 
section? Why wouldn't the user just believe that the name is simply a 
heading within the section?

    I'm strongly opposed to the use of &lt;h1&gt; as a tab label. I would 
object far less if it were this:

&lt;sectionlabel for=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Section 1&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/sectionlabel&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;
   Content.
&lt;/section&gt;

    For WA1-compliant browsers, &lt;sectionlabel&gt; (or any of a million 
names for the element that would be far better than this one) would 
ignore heading elements such as &lt;h1&gt;.

    The reason for my objection is semantic overloading. The &lt;h1&gt; 
element would mean different things _semantically_ depending on the 
situation. This isn't really a problem with &lt;menu&gt; because it's already 
depreciated in HTML4, so the semantic value outside of being used as a 
menu is minimal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>The name &lt;tabbox&gt; will probably be changed to &lt;group&gt;. See the spec 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>for better examples. (Graceful degradation as your example had is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>possible too, since non-section elements in the tabbox are ignored.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   My &lt;tabstrip&gt; is actually more powerful, because it allows tabs to be used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>separately from the sections concept. For instance, the &lt;tabstrip&gt; could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>used with frames:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;tabstrip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &lt;tabs&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;tab for=&quot;section1.htm&quot; target=&quot;main&quot;&gt;Section 1&lt;/tab&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;tab for=&quot;section2.htm&quot; target=&quot;main&quot;&gt;Section 2&lt;/tab&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &lt;tab for=&quot;section3.htm&quot; target=&quot;main&quot;&gt;Section 3&lt;/tab&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &lt;/tabs&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;/tabstrip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is also supported in the &lt;tabbox&gt; case, using &lt;a&gt; elements instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section&gt; elements.
</I>
    Yeah, I missed that in the spec. (Need to read more carefully 
instead of skimming...)

    What I don't understand about the example is that there seems to be 
an implied &lt;iframe&gt;, since there is no |target| specified.

&gt;&gt;<i>It could also be used with simple Javascript events, so vendors could 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>keep tabstrip even if they decide to pass on &lt;section&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what you mean here.
</I>
    Right now, people can create tabs using DHTML. If webmasters had a 
tabstrip like the one that exists in VB, all they would have to do is 
write some Javascript that would run when a tab is clicked that would 
change the ZOrder of a block so that it is on top. Without the tabstrip, 
the webmasters have to implement the entire tabstrip widget, and for 
DHTML, that means you run into styling problems.

&gt;&gt;<i>What is the motivation for passing on the &lt;deck&gt; of &lt;cards&gt; metaphor? To
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>presentational in nature?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I think of &lt;deck&gt;s and &lt;card&gt;s, I don't think of sections or tabs.
</I>
    You're not supposed to. The &lt;deck&gt; element is a parallel to the XUL 
element &lt;deck&gt;, which only displays one element out of a group at any 
one time. The idea is that &lt;deck&gt; is a building block for more 
complicated UI like tabs (when combined with &lt;tabstrip&gt;), wizards, and 
different screens within a computer game.

    A section, in most people's minds, would be a set of paragraphs in a 
document, not a (presentationally) mutually exclusive block.
