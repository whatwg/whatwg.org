</I>
The suggestion of public domain was only brought up briefly during an 
unminutted meeting, and was very quickly dismissed as unworkable by the 
people who know such things. Like I said, I have no interest in 
questioning the reasons or methods of our lawyers, just like they have no 
interest in questioning the reasons or methods of my spec writing.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I also do not think the rather simple statement is sufficient 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; licence for me to accept, Opera could revoke the licence at any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I am aware, once a license has been granted, it can't be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;ungranted&quot; unless the licensee breaks the license conditions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you just said above, you're not a lawyer...  and I certainly have no 
</I>&gt;<i> idea about Norwegian law, but certainly in US law it's not possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> give a licence that cannot be revoked.
</I>
I shall forward your concerns.


&gt;<i> So I think I am right to be concerned, could you be clearer about 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the advice the lawyers gave you,
</I>
No, I can't be any clearer than I have been already.


&gt;<i> I find it rather surprsing that after 2 months lawyers have come back 
</I>&gt;<i> with 1 sentance, I've never seen a lawyer write so little.
</I>
This would seem to be a good thing, not a bad thing.


&gt;<i> &gt; No news on patent stuff yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not?  What's happening, why the delay?
</I>
I have no idea, I'm not involved in the patent matter personally.


&gt;<i> how is Dave Hyatt coming along with his questions to Apple?
</I>
I shall let him answer this.
