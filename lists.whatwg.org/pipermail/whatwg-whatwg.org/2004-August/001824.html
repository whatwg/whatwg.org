I'm sure it has, but not according to IE.

&gt;&gt;<i>What?  The fact that it doesn't support HTML or XHTML at all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're claiming IE doesn't support HTML now?
</I>
No, it doesn't fully support it.  Though, technically, Mozilla and Opera 
don't fully support HTML either (see these tests [1]), but IE is far 
worse.  It doesn't fully support &lt;abbr&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, &lt;link/&gt;, and probably 
several more elements and attributes.

&gt;<i> Do you mean:  <A HREF="http://www.lachy.id.au/">http://www.lachy.id.au/</A>  ? in which case, I seem to get
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 4.01 documents...
</I>
Yes, I put in some effort to set up content negotiation when I set it 
up, so I knew you would get HTML 4.01, but my point was that IE can't 
render documents well at all.  However, I have had a report that someone 
who tried to use IE recieved a 406 response...  I don't know what caused 
it, but IE must be more broken than I thought if it can even get the 
Accept header correct sometimes.

&gt;<i> and the rendering is better than the firefox
</I>&gt;<i> rendering, which seems really slow... not surprising as it waits for
</I>&gt;<i> ages before starting to render it...
</I>
LOL!  Now, that's just being arrogant.  It's quite obvious that the 
document is a complete mess in IE, though it's not as bad as it was &#8212; I 
included a single hack to make it at least readable.  There's not much 
else I can say, except congratulations, you've recieved an award &#9786; [2].

(Note: Mozilla does not correctly view the source as it's written in the 
files, so you'll have to save the file and view with text editor or 
another browser)

(Note: IE doesn't even display the image, or the alternate content for 
it, so you'll have to fire up a browser that works)
