Fixed.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Requirements were derived from requirements?
</I>&gt;<i> How about just &quot;Such comments&quot;?
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you want to add a note about capitalization (or lack thereof, rather)?
</I>
Not really. Should we?


&gt;&gt;<i> ...it is possible that authors would prefer to declare the page's forms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in advance, in the head element of XHTML documents (this does not apply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to HTML documents).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Replace with
</I>&gt;<i>    Similarly, form elements in XHTML may now be nested (this does not apply
</I>&gt;<i>    to HTML).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a more self-contained example, and the text actually occurs in the spec.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> The children of a form element must be block-level elements, unless one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ancestors of the form element is a td, th, li, dd, or block-level element
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other than div.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if they're not?
</I>
Fixed. But you might want to suggest a better way of phrasing it. (The 
content model then would be (%block* | %inline*).)


&gt;&gt;<i> A significand is an optional minus sign (U+002D, &quot;-&quot;), an integer, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optionally a decimal point (U+002E, &quot;.&quot;) and an integer representing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fractional part.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...optionally a decimal point (U+002E, &quot;.&quot;) &gt;followed by&lt; an integer...
</I>
There's no &quot;followed by&quot; in the first part of the list. I don't really 
understand why one would be better in the second part.


&gt;&gt;<i> with which to multiply the base to get the resulting number
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> base -&gt; significand, to be consistent with the previous sentence.
</I>
Oop. Fixed.

 
&gt;<i> resulting number -&gt; desired number
</I>&gt;<i> (If you're multiplying two numbers, you'll always have a resulting number,
</I>&gt;<i>   even if that resulting number isn't the number you wanted.)
</I>
Used &quot;actual number&quot;.


&gt;<i> Probably should swap &quot;A significand&quot; -&gt; &quot;The significand&quot; and &quot;An 
</I>&gt;<i> exponent&quot; -&gt; &quot;The exponent&quot;. The reason is you need to refer to &quot;the 
</I>&gt;<i> number&quot;, so you need to have all the number bits be definitively 
</I>&gt;<i> described (so that we're always talking about this one specific number).
</I>
*shrug*. Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> while being easier to parse than some other floating point syntaxes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> easier to parse or easer to read?
</I>
Parse.


&gt;&gt;<i> Note that +0, 0e+0, +0e0 are invalid numbers (the minus sign cannot be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replaced by a plus sign for positive numbers, it must simply be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> omitted). UAs must not submit numbers in invalid formats (whatever the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user might enter).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't combine the note and the conformance requirement in the same 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph. I suggest moving the first sentence to the end of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Numbers must be submitted as&quot; paragraph and the shifting the resulting 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;UAs must not&quot; paragraph to before the &quot;This format is designed&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> justification paragraph.
</I>
Changed &quot;Note that&quot; to &quot;The strings&quot;.


&gt;&gt;<i> See below for notes on IDN
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hyperlink &quot;notes on IDN&quot; instead of &quot;below&quot;.
</I>
I urge you to concentrate on details that actually matter.


&gt;&gt;<i> must have no value selected, unless a default value
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest removing that comma.
</I>
Doesn't really seem to aid in readability, but ok.


&gt;&gt;<i> then the defaultValue DOM attribute has the specified value
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> missing end tag
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> Extensions to theinput element
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Empty fields (those with no value) do not need to match their type... 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ranges The ERROR_TYPE_MISMATCH code is used for fields whose values do 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not match their types...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should have a section that briefly introduces type-checking
</I>&gt;<i> and includes all the random statements like this. They're currently
</I>&gt;<i> scattered throughout the section, so the whole idea gets lost. (The section
</I>&gt;<i> further down is too focused on the submission and DOM Events algorithms to
</I>&gt;<i> help.)
</I>
Ok, added an intro section. However, the first sentence you quoted above 
isn't in it, as that's a really minor detail (and, to authors, should be 
pretty obvious since it has been that way forever), and the second one is 
actually covered by a more detailed summary in the DOM section, to which 
the sentence already links.


&gt;&gt;<i> a sequence of digits 0-9, treated as a base ten integer
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should define integer somewhere and just refer to it with a 
</I>&gt;<i> hyperlinked &quot;integer&quot;.
</I>
Yeah, I've been thinking of doing that. Will bear that in mind.


&gt;&gt;<i> For date and time types it must match the relevant format mentioned for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that type, having all the fields present and with the right number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> digits, with the right separating punctuation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can we let the time portions omit the seconds?
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> The datalist element and the list attribute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  text, email, , uri,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> double comma?
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> When a control has a list attribute
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your tenses are screwed up in this paragraph.
</I>
That entire sentence was way too complicated to understand. I've split it 
into multiple paragraphs.


&gt;<i> And you're requiring an algorithm again.
</I>
Actually if you carefully read that section, you'll notice that the 
algorithm isn't required. It is carefully phrased in the form of &quot;the list 
shall be the one that would be formed by&quot;, thus making it a strict 
conformance requirement that the list be indistinguishable from the one 
described, but not specifying how it is implemented.


&gt;&gt;<i> The UA may use the label attribute to annotate the value in its interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The UA /should/ use the label attribute, and if there is no label 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, it should use the text content of the &lt;option&gt;
</I>
It's the UA's UI. We're not requiring anything that specific.

&gt;&gt;<i> If the element is marked as disabled, if the autocompletion value is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the empty string,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>
Why what?


&gt;&gt;<i> or if the autocompletion value is not a valid value for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control's type (for example, 20 is not a valid value for a datetime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control) then it must be ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This should not be part of the same sentence. The way you have it
</I>&gt;<i> written, it means that if I have an invalid but disabled value, it
</I>&gt;<i> gets treated as the empty string and not ignored.
</I>
I don't understand how you read it that way, at all.


&gt;&gt;<i> The author-specified list of predefined values may be augmented by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the UA's own autocompletion logic, for example the UA may remember
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previous values that the user has entered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> autocompletion logic. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;For example&quot; is not a conjunction. You cannot use it to combine two
</I>&gt;<i> full clauses.
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> This element should not be displayed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This should probably be qualified by an &quot;if the UA supports
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;datalist&gt;&quot; or somesuch. I do expect WF2 will be implemented
</I>&gt;<i> piecemeal, insofar as the pieces are complete. &lt;datalist&gt; is one
</I>&gt;<i> such feature.
</I>
Fixed.

 
&gt;&gt;<i> To complement the new list attribute, a datalist element is introduced.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about introducing the element _before_ you use it in your algorithm?
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> This element has two roles.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> . -&gt; :
</I>
Seriously, please concentrate on things that matter. When the text is
already correct, suggesting punctuation changes that only arguably
improve readability simply wastes your time and mine.


&gt;&gt;<i> It provides a list of data values, in the form of a list of option
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> elements, and it may be used to provide an alternate representation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the form for user agents that do not support this specification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second half of the sentence is not clear. It took me awhile to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out what you meant, and I already knew from the mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> how you mean to use &lt;datalist&gt;.
</I>
Any suggestions for improvements?


&gt;&gt;<i> Authors must only put empty option elements
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's no reason I should not be able to do this:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;datalist&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;select&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;option&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;/select&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/datalist&gt;
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> For controls inside datalist  elements must never be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> remove &quot;For&quot;
</I>
Done (that was actually a type for Form, though).


&gt;&gt;<i> This data is not made available to the page DOM.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do we need a must requirement for this?
</I>
It's an example, so no. It's just stating a fact given what the spec
already says.


&gt;&gt;<i> inside the value attribute instead of inline
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> missing end tag
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> However, if the values are required to be shown
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> need to be shown
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;&gt;<i> The UA could hove
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>
Fixed.
