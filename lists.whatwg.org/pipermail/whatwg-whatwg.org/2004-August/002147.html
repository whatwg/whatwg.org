&gt;&gt;<i> [RFC2119 terms - uppercase or not]
</I>&gt;<i> What the purpose may have been is not spelled out in the spec, and the

</I>&gt;<i> Which is my point. :-) They don't _need_ to be uppercase, it's just, IMHO, 
</I>&gt;<i> a typographic convention.
</I>
I'd actually argue that it's a semantic convention, since it allows the 
reader to distinguish between 'must' (the word) and 'MUST' (the RFC2119 
term), which can be quite useful in a sloppy language like English. But 
that's a shakey argument at best, especially since it's not formally 
described anywhere (and RFC2119 doesn't count, since, as you've mentioned,  
it's not explicit enough). 

&gt;<i> Many, many specs (especially W3C specs) don't use uppercase.
</I>
I can't say I've noticed. Maybe I don't read enough specs? :-)
CSS 2.1 was the one I first noticed, and that has an explicit explanation at 
the top. I thought it was rather clever. 

&gt;<i> It now says:
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> Is that ok?
</I>
Fine by me - it's almost identical to the CSS21 wording.

Malcolm
