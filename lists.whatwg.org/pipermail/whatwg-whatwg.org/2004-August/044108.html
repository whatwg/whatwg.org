I just added a note to the document that says:

</I>

&gt;<i> 2. Also (not wishing to compicate things too much!) did you consider

</I>
I considered it but I couldn't really see an easy way to do it. If JS
supported perl's scoped modifiers, that would work, but I don't think
it does.


&gt;<i> 3. Finally, is it necessary to have an ERROR_ for invalid regexes
</I>
No, if the regexp is invalid, it is just ignored.


&gt;<i> I guess the real point of 1 is consistency, and the expectation that the
</I>&gt;<i> input control will do what you expect. For example - I would expect that
</I>&gt;<i> if I already have a validator implemented in javascript, I should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to use the same regex pattern that I am using to validate an imput
</I>&gt;<i> field in the script.
</I>
Most of the time you would, unless your pattern was specifically a
substring search pattern, which seems unlikely.


Thanks for your input!
