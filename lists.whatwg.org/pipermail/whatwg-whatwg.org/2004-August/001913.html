&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * 1.6 Conformance Requirements -- Web Forms says that conformance is 
</I>&gt;<i> indicated by RFC2119 terms, but doesn't use any AFAICT; while there are 
</I>&gt;<i> many lower-case must, may and should's in the document, they need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> uppercase to qualify as requirements.
</I>
Why do they need to be uppercase?


&gt;<i> * 1.6 Conformance Requirements, paragraphs 7 and 8 -- What is the 
</I>&gt;<i> significance of &quot;over HTTP&quot; for the media types; does this imply that 
</I>&gt;<i> they may be served with different media types over other protocols?
</I>
Changed it to &quot;over the wire (e.g. by HTTP)&quot;.


&gt;<i> * 2.1 Extensions to the input element (no impact on this specification) 
</I>&gt;<i> -- I understand the WG intends that CSS dictate the presentation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> various controls (e.g. a clock vs. a text field for date entry). When 
</I>&gt;<i> doing so, I'd ask that consideration be given to the possibility for 
</I>&gt;<i> alternate, user-selectable modes on the same form; e.g., I as a user may 
</I>&gt;<i> want to override the clock method of entry for a particular form, so 
</I>&gt;<i> that I can use the text field mode, even though the CSS specifies a 
</I>&gt;<i> clock.
</I>
User stylesheets would be definitely be well suited for that sort of 
thing.


&gt;<i> * 2.1 Extensions to the input element, last paragraph -- &quot;The size 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute of the input element is deprecated in favour of using CSS to 
</I>&gt;<i> specify the layout of the form.&quot; This approach isn't used elsewhere 
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., AFAICT, other similar situations don't result in deprecation). 
</I>
I'm not aware of any similar situations.


&gt;<i> Also, what is the force of deprecation WRT conformance?
</I>
Nothing at this stage; however, it is presumed that a future version of 
the specification (HTML6, maybe) would remove the attribute altogether.


&gt;<i> * 2.1.1 Ranges -- &quot;values allowed by the above types&quot; --&gt; &quot;values allowed by
</I>&gt;<i> some of the above types&quot;
</I>
Fixed.


&gt;<i> * 2.1.2 Precision -- &quot;fractional number&quot; --&gt; &quot;decimal number&quot;?
</I>
A &quot;decimal number&quot; is just an number in base ten. The intent here is to 
specifically allow numbers that are not integers.


&gt;<i> * 2.12 The autocomplete attribute -- Nothing is said about the scope of
</I>&gt;<i> completion when the value is &quot;on&quot;; e.g., is a value on form on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.example.com/foo">http://www.example.com/foo</A> able to be used for completion for a form on /bar?
</I>
The exact mechanism is now explicitly undefined.


&gt;<i> * 2.16 Handling unexpected elements and values, second paragraph -- if 
</I>&gt;<i> you want this specification to be taken seriously, please act 
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>
Given the subject of that section, that _is_ serious, as any seasoned UA 
implementor or QA engineer can attest.


&gt;<i> * 2.16 Handling unexpected elements and values, &quot;For parsing errors in 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML&quot; -- giving advice to reverse-engineer products may not be wise 
</I>&gt;<i> (IANAL) and certainly isn't good practice for specifications, even if it 
</I>&gt;<i> is realistic.
</I>
Being realistic is good practice for specifications. It's certainly better 
than pretending that everything is well-defined or that UAs can do 
whatever they want.


&gt;<i> * 2.16 Handling unexpected elements and values, last paragraph -- How should
</I>&gt;<i> this be tested? Seems like a recipe for interoperability problems.
</I>
I'm not sure which paragraph you are referring to.


&gt;<i> * 2.4 Extensions to the textarea element -- it would be interesting if a 
</I>&gt;<i> media type for the textarea could be specified; e.g., if it were 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;text/html&quot; the textarea would become a HTML editor, or a rich text 
</I>&gt;<i> editor for &quot;text/rtf&quot;.
</I>
Good idea; we will look at this in more detail for Web Forms 3.0.


&gt;<i> * 5.6 Submitting the encoded form data set -- Have the consequences of 
</I>&gt;<i> making method fall back to GET been considered, WRT phasing in new 
</I>&gt;<i> methods?
</I>
That's just describing existing behaviour, I think


&gt;<i> I don't have a strong preference here, but the issues may be subtle. In 
</I>&gt;<i> the event that the current approach is kept, it should be made explicit 
</I>&gt;<i> that the actual method remains what is specified, rather than changing 
</I>&gt;<i> to GET, so that no information is lost.
</I>
Not sure what you mean by this.


&gt;<i> * 5.6 Submitting the encoded form data set -- &quot;resource is fetched&quot; --&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;representation is fetched&quot;
</I>
&quot;representation&quot;?


&gt;<i> * 6.2 Seeding a form with initial values -- it's not good practice to 
</I>&gt;<i> put a requirement (&quot;should not&quot;) in a note.
</I>
It's not a requirement, since it is in a note. It's just advice.

Maybe it should be made normative, though. Any preference?


Thanks for your input!
