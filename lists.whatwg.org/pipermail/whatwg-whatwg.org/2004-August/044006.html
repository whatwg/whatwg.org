I agree that it can be useful if you know its limitations.

My concern is mostly that there _are_ claims that having validated 
successfully proves something of much use, otherwise why would pages 
proudly display icons saying &quot;This is valid!&quot; and why would the validator 
so unconditionally praise authors who successfully validate a document?

I could definitely see benefits to providing a validator service, if it 
was clearly labelled as just doing very basic syntax checking.

Thanks for the advice!
