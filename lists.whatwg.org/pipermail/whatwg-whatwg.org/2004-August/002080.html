So this isn't just a bad design, but a design you knew was bad 
beforehand, one which could have been fixed by a single line of CSS 
(and/or a single-line onclick handler).

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see why. The reason to use &lt;label&gt; has nothing to do with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Focus passing is probably the _one_ 'reason' which has any effect at 
</I>&gt;<i> all to convince the many clueless authors out there to start using 
</I>&gt;<i> labels.
</I>
That's why, as I said earlier, UAs should style &lt;label&gt; with the same 
typeface as native UI labels by default. That would be more obviously 
label-like than non-native focus behavior.
