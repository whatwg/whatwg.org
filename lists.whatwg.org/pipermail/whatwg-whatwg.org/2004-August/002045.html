</I>
Ok, NFC and SHOULD it is.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; To prevent an attribute from being processed in this way, put a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; non-breaking zero-width space character (&amp;#xFEFF;) at the start of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Isn't the use of that char as anything but the BOM deprecated or at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; least considered harmful?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Arguably, it _is_ a BOM here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not overly fond of this either, but it's the only solution I could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find that was relatively harmless (the BOM can always be dropped at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the start of strings)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly. Which is why tools used for generating the page might drop it 
</I>&gt;<i> on the server!
</I>
That's fine. When put at the start of the string, it should be dropped. 


&gt;<i> Actually, I am distributing one such tool myself. Is the tool broken?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://iki.fi/hsivonen/php-utf8/">http://iki.fi/hsivonen/php-utf8/</A>
</I>
It depends. If it drops the BOM in the middle of the string, then yes.

I expect this to be used so that you first output the attribute with this 
&quot;BOM&quot;, then the user-derived string, then the rest of the document:

   ...
   print(&quot;&lt;input value=\&quot;\xFEFF&quot;);
   print(escape(data));
   print(&quot;\&quot;&gt;&quot;);
   ...


&gt;<i> My immediate thought is ZWNJ, but I'm not sure if using it is a good 
</I>&gt;<i> idea.
</I>
I think that would be worse than the BOM.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Note that a string containing the codepoint's value itself (for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; example, the six-character string &quot;U+263A&quot; or the seven-character 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; string &quot;&amp;#9786;&quot;) is not considered to be human readable and must 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; not be used as a transliteration.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do you expect UAs that already do this change their behavior with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the legacy submission types?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can hope.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, there may be CMS input form handlers that expect the prohibited 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior. I have been involved in developing one myself. (Not that I 
</I>&gt;<i> recommend relying on such things. Obviously, UTF-8 is the way to go.)
</I>
Yeah. Google, for one. I've also seen login forms where people typed in 
characters not in the form's submission set, and thus got a username that 
was not the one they thought it was, so when they switched to another UA 
that did things differently, it broke. It's madness.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; which has a root element named &quot;submission&quot;, with no prefix, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a default namespace 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; uuid:d10e4fd6-2c01-49e8-8f9d-0ab964387e32.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think that is an inappropriate attempt to micromanage the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; syntactic details that are in the realm of a lower-level spec. I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; think the submission format should either allow all the syntactic 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sugar that comes with Namespaces in XML or be layered directly on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; top XML 1.0 without namespace support.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The reason it is micromanaged is to make it possible to use either a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pure XML 1.0 parser _or_ an XML 1.0 with namespaces parser on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server side without getting into any complications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to guess that that was the rationale behind the requirement. 
</I>&gt;<i> But why is the ability use a namespace-unaware XML processor a 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement? The only reason I can come up with is that PHP4 is borked 
</I>&gt;<i> by default but widely used.
</I>
There are various people using non-namespace-aware parsers. I don't really 
want to force namespace-aware parsing when in fact the document is anyway 
guarenteed to only have one namespace.


&gt;<i> Processing namespaced XML with tools that don't support namespaces is 
</I>&gt;<i> clueless and just plain wrong. If tools that don't support namespaces 
</I>&gt;<i> are to be accommodated, wouldn't the natural way be to spec that the 
</I>&gt;<i> elements are not in a namespace and the namespace processing layer is 
</I>&gt;<i> not used? That way you wouldn't endorse behavior that is clueless and 
</I>&gt;<i> just plain wrong.
</I>
It's actually more the other way around. This is a non-namespaced 
document, but to accomodate people who are going to be using it in 
namespace-aware environments, possibly merging it into other documents, 
etc, it makes sense to actually give it a namespace.

For example, the same data format is later used for seeding forms. If on 
the server you stack the data into a huge XML file containing other data 
too, it would make sense to be able to just yank out that namespaced 
subtree and just use it for preseeding too.


&gt;<i> 1) The current best practice for dispatching on the type of an XML 
</I>&gt;<i> document is dispatching on the namespace. If there was no namespace, one 
</I>&gt;<i> would have to fall back on dispatching on the content type. This is not 
</I>&gt;<i> a real problem with this particular vocabulary because this vocabulary 
</I>&gt;<i> has a distinct content type from the start.
</I>
It does during submission. But when the data is flying about after 
submission, who knows.


&gt;<i> 2) You couldn't mix the vocabulary with other vocabularies using 
</I>&gt;<i> namespaces. This is a theoretical problem but probably not a real one, 
</I>&gt;<i> because the vocabulary is limited to a specific case of client-server 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction.
</I>
It's only limited _if_ it doesn't have a namespace.

Also, it is later used for preseeding forms.


&gt;<i> Besides, the way you limit the use of namespaces in the current spec 
</I>&gt;<i> language would also preclude creative augmentations to the submission 
</I>&gt;<i> vocabulary.
</I>
Well, extensions would be non-compliant, yes. But at least there is a 
clear mechanism for experimentation.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; but must include a BOM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think that is not a legitimate requirement when UTF-8 is used.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is a requirement that applies to the XML serialization, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement is not present in the XML spec. The requirement would mean 
</I>&gt;<i> that you could not use any arbitrary but conforming XML serializer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The use of the BOM as a UTF-8 signature is a Microsoftism that was only 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed in XML 1.0 second edition, because fighting Microsoft text 
</I>&gt;<i> editors would have been futile. Still, if you pick a non-Microsoft XML 
</I>&gt;<i> serializer off the shelf, chances are it does not emit a BOM in the 
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-8 mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a good reason to limit the use of arbitrary but conforming 
</I>&gt;<i> off-the-shelf XML serializers?
</I>
I guess that makes sense. And the BOM isn't really needed anyway. Ok, I've 
made it optional for UTF-8.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; UAs may use either CDATA blocks, entities, or both in escaping the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; contents of attributes and elements, as appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In order not to imply that this spec could restrict the ways 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; characters are escaped, that sentence should be a note rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; part of the normative prose. (Of course, only the pre-defined 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; entities are available. Then there are NCRs.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This spec _could_ restrict the ways characters are escaped. It needs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to not be a note so that the &quot;may&quot; has normative value. No?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The could restrict the escaping in the same sense the HTTP spec could 
</I>&gt;<i> restrict how you choose TCP sequence numbers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In general, please see section 4.3 of RFC 3470.
</I>
Yes, indeed. That's why WF2 specifically _doesn't_ restrict this.
