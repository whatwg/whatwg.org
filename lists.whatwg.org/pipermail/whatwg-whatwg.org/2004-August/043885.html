</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;Show parent&quot;, &quot;Reply&quot; and &quot;Remove&quot;. The user agent would be aware that the
</I>&gt;<i> first link just displays data (and could be prefetched), second modifies data
</I>&gt;<i> and the last one destroys data. UA could even default to different cursors or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever to differentiate between different types. In addition to this, we
</I>&gt;<i> could have &quot;get-with-form-data&quot;, &quot;post-with-form-data&quot; (as usual) and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;delete-with-form-data&quot; and the UA would send all successful form controls
</I>&gt;<i> upon link activation which would save repeating some session book-keeping data
</I>&gt;<i> in every link (usually every link must have at least some session data; more
</I>&gt;<i> about this later).
</I>
You can now do this in an indirect way in Web Forms + Web Apps by making a 
link be equivalent to a command, but I agree that's not the same.

(Like this:

  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; action=&quot;foo.cgi&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;submitter&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;a command=&quot;submitter&quot;/&gt;

...although of course that way you get a button _and_ a link.)

The main problem is that your suggestion:

   &lt;a href=&quot;delete.cgi&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;

...is treated by current UAs as this:

   &lt;a href=&quot;delete.cgi&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;

...and spidered at will. Maybe that's ok though.


&gt;<i> 2) Submit button localization
</I>&gt;<i> 2) I don't know who was the genius behind the decision to use &quot;value&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> attribute as the label of the button but that decision forces me to do actions
</I>&gt;<i> according to control names. If I have buttons &quot;add&quot; and &quot;rm&quot; and those are
</I>&gt;<i> localized in Finnish as &quot;Lis&#228;&#228;&quot; and &quot;Poista&quot;, I don't have any other way to
</I>&gt;<i> decide which one was pressed but check if form control &quot;add&quot; was set. (I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot easily check for &quot;Lis&#228;&#228;&quot; and &quot;Poista&quot;, because environment language
</I>&gt;<i> could have been changed by another user / via another window while this dialog
</I>&gt;<i> was open.) This causes needless extra book-keeping to make sure that I never
</I>&gt;<i> use name &quot;add&quot; for any other element, like for example for a text input
</I>&gt;<i> because it would be always successful! How about &quot;label&quot; attribute so that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;value&quot; can be what it was supposed to be? As a workaround I can name all such
</I>&gt;<i> controls as &quot;action_something&quot; and look through controls that match regexp
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;action_.*&quot; only... Namespace collisions of different controls get harder to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid when I need to keep very much of session data in addition to user input
</I>&gt;<i> and the whole page is generated on the fly.
</I>
Use the &lt;button&gt; element. It has separate label and value control.


&gt;<i> 3) The Back button
</I>&gt;<i> 3) As per HTTP protocol, a compliant UA should NOT send any data to server
</I>&gt;<i> when user activates history action. So, I have to keep all session related
</I>&gt;<i> data on the form so that UA can keep track which data belongs to which dialog.
</I>&gt;<i> If my application stored any live session data (instead of just user settings
</I>&gt;<i> and other more or less static things) on server end a single press of the back
</I>&gt;<i> button would cause the server and client to go out of sync and the whole logic
</I>&gt;<i> would collapse. Currently all links are problem because if I have 30 links on
</I>&gt;<i> a generated page, I have to repeat session data 30 times (once for each link
</I>&gt;<i> so that no data is lost once a link is activated). I cannot use cookies
</I>&gt;<i> because I want to support running multiple user accounts in multiple UA
</I>&gt;<i> instances (user1 in window1 and user2 in window2). Cookies cannot fork either,
</I>&gt;<i> see below.
</I>
Yeah, a per-window, per-site local filestore is on the plans for Web Apps, 
and I think would resolve this for you.


&gt;<i> 4) Duplicate window
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Open link in new window
</I>&gt;<i> 4) and 5) The issue here is really a forking problem. Say, we have a dialog A,
</I>&gt;<i> which has possible actions 01, 02 and 03. 01 leads to dialog B, 02 leads to
</I>&gt;<i> dialog C and 03 leads to dialog D. User first activates 02 with &quot;Open in a new
</I>&gt;<i> window&quot; and server returns B. Then the user select action 03 on the dialog B
</I>&gt;<i> that leads to dialog E. Then the user changes to previous window and select 03
</I>&gt;<i> which should lead to dialog D (because the other window had dialog A open).
</I>&gt;<i> Throw a couple of Back-buttons in the mix and you begin to see the issue...
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly the user wanted to use multiple windows and back-button presses to do
</I>&gt;<i> the actions, so the issue isn't how to prevent opening new windows or
</I>&gt;<i> disabling back-button. The issue is, how to still keep the session handling
</I>&gt;<i> sane while using logically connectionless protocol such as HTTP? My current
</I>&gt;<i> answer to this is to keep as much data about the session embedded in the page
</I>&gt;<i> as possible. If the UA is able to duplicate windows or display historical
</I>&gt;<i> pages, it will use the embedded data in that copy, too.
</I>
Another solution is to not use multiple pages -- with Web Forms 2, when 
the user hits submit, instead of loading the remote page you can simply 
take the results and use them in your script.


&gt;<i> For the 3), 4) and 5) I'd propose adding two magical hidden field names:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;_frame_id_&quot; and &quot;_document_id_&quot;. Both would be always successful and their
</I>&gt;<i> values would be set automatically. The _frame_id_ would be unique for the
</I>&gt;<i> current set of page instances (in practice, an unique identifier for all the
</I>&gt;<i> windows and frames) and _document_id_ would be unique for all documents
</I>&gt;<i> (pages) the UA handles, including past, current and future. _frame_id_ could
</I>&gt;<i> be implemented as a serial number that has been attached to every window or
</I>&gt;<i> frame and every time a new window or frame were created, the serial number
</I>&gt;<i> would be increased by one. The _document_id_ would be similar, but it would be
</I>&gt;<i> increased every time any document had been loaded in any frame. This would
</I>&gt;<i> include going back and forward in the history. The server end could then use
</I>&gt;<i> these two values to figure out which dialog sent out the event. [1]
</I>
This sounds like a workaround more than a solution, although it could 
indeed work.
