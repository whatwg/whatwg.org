The type of window used is irrelevant. To pick just three examples,  
HTML5 applications will not be able to avoid that on some platforms  
there will be a menu bar, they will not be able to control their  
taskbar/Dock icon, and they will not be able to handle documents  
dragged to the application's icon. None of those have anything to do  
with the type of window.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    Then again, I've seen Java applications in a browser that have such
</I>&gt;<i> menubars, so there may be a demand for this. Another thing is that
</I>&gt;<i> someone may want to create a simulated desktop interface where they can
</I>&gt;<i> open multiple &quot;windows&quot; within the browser windows. In that case, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice if these window-like blocks could have their own  
</I>&gt;<i> menubars.
</I>
That doesn't make sense on those platforms where applications have menu  
bars but windows do not.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, making &lt;menubar&gt; &quot;look like a menu bar&quot; would involve  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having two or more visually similar menu bars on the screen  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simultaneously. But this is bizarre behavior on some platforms, and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even on platforms where it is expected behavior, it is highly  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    One thing we could do is come up with a way to display menubars on a
</I>&gt;<i> few key operating systems that doesn't confuse users, then allow enough
</I>&gt;<i> room in the spec for user agent vendors to create their own solutions.
</I>
IMO allowing &quot;user agent vendors to create their own solutions&quot; is a  
copout from admitting that there is no practical solution for the  
platforms some user agents are running on, which is bad for  
interoperability. (For an example of such silliness, see  
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-color-20030514/#flavor">http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-color-20030514/#flavor</A>&gt;.) There's no  
point in providing freedom to choose, if the number of practical  
choices is zero.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    Furthermore, HTML 4.01 allows support for &lt;link&gt; to implemented in
</I>&gt;<i> any way the UA vendor chooses,
</I>
Which is partly why authors don't use it.

&gt;<i> so suddenly turning &lt;link&gt; into a menu system could cause serious  
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>
Like it becoming useful, perhaps. :-)

&gt;<i> This is especially true if a browser vendor chose to put &lt;link&gt; items  
</I>&gt;<i> in a submenu off the main browser menu.
</I>
I don't remember anyone on this list suggesting that. Hiding them in a  
menu would certainly fail my &quot;reliably noticable&quot; criterion  
&lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/</A> 
001197.html&gt;.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, I suggest the &lt;menubar&gt; element be renamed to &lt;menulist&gt;,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to indicate that (in graphical UAs) its child &lt;menu&gt;s will be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendered vertically by default.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    A bar can be vertical. I've seen many toolbars that can be
</I>&gt;<i> positioned that way. The Windows &quot;Taskbar&quot; can be vertical. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> really think this presents a serious conceptual problem.
</I>
Good!

&gt;<i>    As for a default direction, I'd rather have CSS or an HTML attribute
</I>&gt;<i> handle it.
</I>
Sure, just as CSS can be used to alter the orientation of OL or UL or  
DL.

&gt;&gt;<i> That would suit the usual use case for adjacent menus, and would  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoid wrongly implying that it should look like a native menu bar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    On a chromeless window, it probably SHOULD look like a native  
</I>&gt;<i> menubar.
</I>
No, because that would (on some platforms) still involve having two or  
more visually similar menu bars on the screen simultaneously.

&gt;&gt;<i> Authors wanting horizontally adjacent menus could get them without  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra styling just by using adjacent &lt;menu&gt;s, without a &lt;menulist&gt;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> element.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    How would they do this, by setting the |style| property equal to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;display: inline&quot;?
</I>
No, they'd do it &quot;by using adjacent &lt;menu&gt;s, without a &lt;menulist&gt;  
element&quot;. For example, &lt;menu...&gt;...&lt;/menu&gt; &lt;menu...&gt;...&lt;/menu&gt;.

&gt;<i> Keep in mind, an element name like &quot;menubar&quot; or &quot;menulist&quot; can  
</I>&gt;<i> communicate more than just visual position. Native menubar rendering  
</I>&gt;<i> on a chromeless window, for instance, would be impossible without such  
</I>&gt;<i> an element.
</I>
I don't know what you're trying to say here.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    I don't mind presenting &lt;menu&gt; as a button when not in the context
</I>&gt;<i> of  a menubar. However, should this be required in the spec, or simply
</I>&gt;<i> recommended?
</I>
How strongly the Web Apps spec suggests particular visual presentation  
is suggested for &lt;menu&gt; probably depends on how strongly the What-WG  
specs suggest particular visual presentation for controls in general. I  
don't think Ian has said anything about that yet.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    You're confusing the implementation of a drop-down list for &lt;select&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> with the &lt;select&gt; element itself. The &lt;select&gt; element could be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in a manner similar to that shown in the HTML 4.01
</I>&gt;<i> specification, for instance:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/images/optgroup_exmpl.gif">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/images/optgroup_exmpl.gif</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    The &lt;select&gt; element could be implemented as a pull-down menu.
</I>
That would be even worse, but in a different way: it would mean in some  
cases the current selection wasn't visible at all even immediately  
after the menu was opened. For example, someone who chose &quot;Uzbekistan&quot;  
by mistake instead of &quot;USA&quot; would have to scroll through (nearly) the  
whole damn menu of countries again, instead of mousing down on the menu  
and dragging northward ~5 pixels. (On the Windows platform, and in  
Gecko on all platforms, decrementing a &lt;select&gt; value is more  
time-consuming -- you need to click the menu, then move down(!) to  
click the up arrow, then move across to click the correct item. But  
that's still not as bad as a pull-down menu would be.)

That's probably why no toolkit I know of presents any of its  
one-of-many selection controls (listboxes, scrolling listboxes, option  
menus, or sets of radiobuttons) in the way the W3C illustrates. It  
would be far too annoying.

&gt;<i> Besides, in the context of using &lt;select&gt; WITHIN &lt;menu&gt;, a pull-down
</I>&gt;<i> menu would almost certainly be used.
</I>
Sure, but that's not what was being discussed.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another reason not to have &lt;optgroup&gt;s inside &lt;select&gt;s is that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option menus are supposed to show their state even when closed, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they cannot do so reliably if two or more submenus contain items with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Easy to fix. Display the &lt;option&gt; |label| as in the menu and the  
</I>&gt;<i> child text of the &lt;option&gt; as the selection. This is consistent with  
</I>&gt;<i> the example from section 17.6.1 of the HTML 4.01 spec:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
As I said, &quot;the distinction could not be shown in a single  
native-looking option menu while the menu was closed, without making  
the menu abnormally wide&quot;. The W3C's example uses abnormally short  
submenu items in an attempt to make &lt;optgroup&gt; look practically  
implementable.
