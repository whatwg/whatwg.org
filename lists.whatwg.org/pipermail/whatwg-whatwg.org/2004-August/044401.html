These sort of &quot;do you want to...&quot; giving the user a choice of
something they probably don't understand is very problematical.  They
want to access the site, they'll probably just say yes  - just like so
many people say yes and open &quot;viruses&quot; on email today.

I think this is a very difficult thing, and I don't currently believe
any mandated wording or description from the WHAT-WG is appropriate. 
Neither do I necessarily believe anything is appropriate, I'm not sure
of a solution, but I certainly believe IE's HTA is a preferred
solution (it treats the web-browser version exactly as if the user was
downloading an executable - they still run into the how do the users
know to trust problems, but I think it's better to simply a browser
menu.)  I don't really know though, I'm just concerned by the above
proposal for many of the reasons given in the thread already.

&gt;<i> You're assuming that we give the pages a way to tell if they are running
</I>&gt;<i> in a Web browser or &quot;as a native application&quot;. It could definitely see
</I>&gt;<i> strong arguments for not making it possible to distinguish the two.
</I>
how exactly do you propose to do that, there's going to be all sorts
of ways of inferring that they are (checking computed CSS properties,
try/catching script that would only be permissiong in the native
application etc.)   If you could genuinely prevent them from knowing,
I think you'd have to seriously hobble CSS Object Model etc.

Jim.
