</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've run into several cases where I've needed this. For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; writing a game application with four screens, all implemented in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same HTML file: the login screen, the game &quot;lobby&quot; screen, the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; game screen, and the results screen. Only one of those is to be

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    That's _presentational_ mutual exclusion. I fail to see how that 
</I>&gt;<i> amounts to _semantic_ mutual exclusion.
</I>
I disagree. I think it is very much a semantic mutual exclusion. It makes 
no sense to be showing the game screen when the user hasn't yet logged in, 
for instance.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, the spec currently has a separate section for tabs, which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; says that the tabbed version of the above would be:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;    &lt;tabbox&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      &lt;section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Section 1&lt;/h1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      &lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      &lt;section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Section 2&lt;/h1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;      &lt;/section&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;    &lt;/tabbox&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Quick note: I have to say, I don't like the header tags being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; treated as tag labels. There are cases where we've done something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; similar, but only when absolutely necessary. I'm a little concerned 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that we're getting too clever with our markup rather than having a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; straight-forward standard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's not straight-forward about this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Well, for starters, exactly how would someone unfamiliar with HTML5 
</I>&gt;<i> know that the &lt;h1&gt; element contains the name of the tab for that 
</I>&gt;<i> section? Why wouldn't the user just believe that the name is simply a 
</I>&gt;<i> heading within the section?
</I>
How would someone unfamiliar with HTML4 know that &lt;var&gt; is for marking up 
variables? How would someone not familiar with HTML5 know that &lt;section&gt; 
referred to a document section, and not a band section? (&lt;section 
class=&quot;violins&quot;&gt;).

The name _is_ simply a heading within the section. And the heading's 
section title is the tab's title. I don't understand why that is a 
problem? I think it's a bit semantically dubious to have to give the 
section titles twice.


&gt;<i> I would object far less if it were this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;sectionlabel for=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Section 1&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/sectionlabel&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;section id=&quot;section1&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   Content.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/section&gt;
</I>
But that's really ugly.

   &lt;h1&gt;Section 1&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;section&gt;
   &lt;/section&gt;

...would not be as ugly, but even then, you've lost most of the 
possibilities of doing magic with &lt;section&gt; (as described in the spec, 
like using CSS selectors to style the &lt;h1&gt;) and it makes defining &lt;h1&gt;'s 
semanics a lot harder.



&gt;<i> I'm strongly opposed to the use of &lt;h1&gt; as a tab label. [...] The reason 
</I>&gt;<i> for my objection is semantic overloading. The &lt;h1&gt; element would mean 
</I>&gt;<i> different things _semantically_ depending on the situation.
</I>
Why is that a problem?

What would &lt;h1&gt; mean there if it wasn't &quot;section header&quot;?


&gt;<i>    What I don't understand about the example is that there seems to be 
</I>&gt;<i> an implied &lt;iframe&gt;, since there is no |target| specified.
</I>
No &lt;iframe&gt;; the links just act like normal links and replace the current 
page if they have no target=&quot;&quot; attribute.

(This is similar to how the www.whatwg.org pages have a tab strip at the 
top with links to several pages.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It could also be used with simple Javascript events, so vendors 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; could keep tabstrip even if they decide to pass on &lt;section&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not sure what you mean here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Right now, people can create tabs using DHTML. If webmasters had a 
</I>&gt;<i> tabstrip like the one that exists in VB, all they would have to do is 
</I>&gt;<i> write some Javascript that would run when a tab is clicked that would 
</I>&gt;<i> change the ZOrder of a block so that it is on top. Without the tabstrip, 
</I>&gt;<i> the webmasters have to implement the entire tabstrip widget, and for 
</I>&gt;<i> DHTML, that means you run into styling problems.
</I>
So basically you are saying &quot;&lt;tabstrip&gt; allows people who have JS enabled 
to write JS that hooks into the &lt;tabstrip&gt; element to fake a tabstrip?&quot; If 
so, then I don't understand your concern. If JS is enabled, they can 
synthesise all the elements they want from the markup, just like a native 
implementation would.


&gt;<i>    A section, in most people's minds, would be a set of paragraphs in a 
</I>&gt;<i> document, not a (presentationally) mutually exclusive block.
</I>
That's exactly the point. It needn't be rendered as a tab, that's just the 
preferred default rendering for visual UAs. It could, in fact, be rendered 
just as the sections one after the other (as it would in most legacy UAs).
