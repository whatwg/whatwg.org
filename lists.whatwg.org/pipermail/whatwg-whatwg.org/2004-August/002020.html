Other people have already mentioned this on this list. It is common to 
want to have tables where each row is a separate form.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Norwegian [ ...........]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...where the English fields are one form, and the Norwegian fields
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     are another.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you explain more what you mean here - what does &quot;prefilling

&gt;&gt;<i>   * Having subforms, where you have, e.g., one form covering most of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     page, and then little forms within it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> could you again explain more about this in terms of a use case, it
</I>&gt;<i> seems like you've gone from the feature to justify it.   Use cases
</I>&gt;<i> involve uses, not functionality.
</I>
One example of this kind of case is a form which accepts an address, where 
the post code can be filled in separately, and where there is a small form 
for this purpose which can do postcode number lookup.

Similar things for, e.g., looking up product part numbers while filling up 
a bigger form.

It can also be seen on big sites which may have a form for the whole page, 
and then small forms in sidebars and the like for, e.g., search forms.


&gt;&gt;<i>   * Being able to predefine the form submission URIs at the top of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     page and then using them without having to think about what form an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     element is in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm getting even more confused now...  how does having forms not a
</I>&gt;<i> member of their containing form element allow you to &quot;not think about
</I>&gt;<i> form an element is in&quot; it seems to me that it makes it absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> explicit that you know what form an element is in - since you have to
</I>&gt;<i> add it to the element.  I'm obviously mis-understanding.
</I>
I meant not think about the structure. Many authors have told me they 
don't like having to think about whether the element they are adding to 
their large document is a child of the &lt;form&gt; element or whether they have 
to move the &lt;form&gt; element up a few divs (or tables) to make it include 
the element they just added.


&gt;<i> Can I ask again for some use cases - those that made you decide &quot;right 
</I>&gt;<i> the solution to that is having form elements in different forms&quot; - 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than ones that you seem to have made up given the premise that 
</I>&gt;<i> such things exist.  Or at the very least expand these so I can 
</I>&gt;<i> understand them.
</I>
If what I included in this e-mail is not enough for you, then I don't know 
what else to say, sorry.
