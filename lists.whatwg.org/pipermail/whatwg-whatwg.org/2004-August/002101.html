</I>
That isn't a normative reference either. :-)

A &lt;label&gt; element with no referenced control is indeed semantically 
worthless. So is an empty &lt;li&gt; element or a &lt;form&gt; that contains no form 
controls. However, they are all allowed.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   I'm not sure what you mean by the terms &quot;valid&quot; and &quot;conformant&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Valid&quot; means &quot;syntacticaly correct according to the DTD&quot;, which is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subset of &quot;conformant&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Conformant&quot; means &quot;conforming to the spec's conformance 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirements&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    So, by these definitions, would an empty, unused &lt;datalist&gt; element 
</I>&gt;<i> be valid and conformant?
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   On the other hand, you can easily make &lt;label&gt; behave like it does 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in most operating systems by simply using text instead of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &lt;label&gt; element. Why try to eliminate a feature of HTML when the web 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; authors are fully capable of dealing with and problems by making 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trivial changes to markup?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really don't understand why you _want_ labels to do the wrong thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Wrong as defined by whom?
</I>
The platform UI guideline authors.


&gt;<i> Changing the behavior introduces as many problems as it solves. You're 
</I>&gt;<i> just gambling that the new set of problems will be less critical.
</I>
The behaviour hasn't been changed. The text in Web Apps 1.0 doesn't 
contradict the text in HTML4.


&gt;<i> &gt; That clicking a label element transfers focus is not a feature of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTML, it's a misfeature and almost certainly another example of vague 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and misleading comments in the spec, rather than actual intent from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the authors of the HTML spec.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Horse feathers! From the spec:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;This example assigns the access key 'U' to a label associated with 
</I>&gt;<i> an INPUT control. Typing the access key gives focus to the label which 
</I>&gt;<i> in turn gives it to the associated control. The user may then enter text 
</I>&gt;<i> into the INPUT area.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    If it's unintentional, why to they go out of their way to mention 
</I>&gt;<i> that the access key is passed from the label to the control? 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, look at the actual control in the example it refers to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;LABEL for=&quot;fuser&quot; accesskey=&quot;U&quot;&gt;User Name&lt;/LABEL&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;INPUT type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;user&quot; id=&quot;fuser&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    It's a TEXT BOX!!! Clearly, the focus passing behavior in the spec is 
</I>&gt;<i> intentional. Why else would you give &lt;label&gt; an |accesskey| attribute 
</I>&gt;<i> int he first place?
</I>
I don't deny that the accesskey attribute should work on &lt;label&gt; elements. 
The WA1 spec even mentions it explicitly.


&gt;<i>    Saying that the HTML 4.01 label behavior is a mistake is one thing, 
</I>&gt;<i> and there's a reasonable argument for that. Saying it was an accident is 
</I>&gt;<i> ridiculous.
</I>
I was referring to the idea that clicking the label should forward focus. 
But as I later realised, and pointed out here, the HTML4 spec doesn't 
require that anyway.


&gt;<i> &gt; One of the best things about strongly semantic markup like HTML's is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it can automatically adapt to the environment, rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriately whatever the operating system or platform. On some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platforms, buttons can take focus; on others, they can't. On some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platforms, labels can be activated and cause focus to be transfered 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (or even more, e.g. a checkbox to get checked); on others, they can't. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some platforms have labels that apply to some elements; others, other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elements.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The beauty of HTML and semantic markup is that the _same_ source 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document can result in correct, platform-convention-following 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interfaces whatever the actual platform is, without the author having 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to even know the platform exists, let alone what conventions it has.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    True, but in most situations identical blocks of markup with 
</I>&gt;<i> identical CSS properties render and behave the same.
</I>
Render, yes. Except that CSS applying to form controls isn't defined. 
Behave? Not at all, at least not yet. It's one of the reasons XBL is being 
defined, of course.


&gt;<i> By going with the native platform conventions, you force identical 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;label&gt; markup to behave (and possibly render) differently, solely 
</I>&gt;<i> because of the associated control:
</I>
Yes. This is a feature, not a bug. It makes HTML applications fit into the 
native OS as first-class citizens instead of making them inconsistent with 
other user applications.


&gt;<i>    Now suppose you want to style labels that pass the focus to their 
</I>&gt;<i> associated controls. In HTML 4.01, it's simple. You just style &lt;label&gt;.
</I>
HTML4 doesn't normatively define how &lt;label&gt; elements can ever get focus. 
So no, it's not that simple. There's in fact no guarentee that two 
examples of using &lt;label&gt; with controls will work the same.


&gt;<i>    How do you do the same when the behavior is platform specific? Do you 
</I>&gt;<i> add a new CSS pseudoclass? Perhaps &quot;focuspassing&quot;? If the native 
</I>&gt;<i> operating system has a specific style for labels that pass focus, do you 
</I>&gt;<i> override the &lt;label&gt; styling if a style for focus-passing labels isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> defined?
</I>
Why would you want to do this? I don't understand the use case.
