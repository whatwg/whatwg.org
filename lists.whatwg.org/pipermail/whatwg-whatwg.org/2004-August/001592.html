<PRE>Also sprach fantasai:

 &gt; &gt;  &gt; This type is used most frequently for dates in European industry.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; editorial: &quot;European industry&quot; -&gt; &quot;Europe&quot;. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Don't most people in Europe use the month+day system? I've never
 &gt; heard anyone say, &quot;I'm going home in week 35,&quot; but plenty of people
 &gt; say, &quot;I'm going home in August.&quot;

In spoken language, months are much more common. However, when you
sign up for holidays, or schedule a delivery or something (both are
typical form use cases), week numbers are typically used. Also, week
numbers are often more accurate. Instead of saying &quot;i'll be on holiday
the first week of august&quot;, it's more accurate to say &quot;I'll be on
holiday in week 32&quot;.

My point was that this is not only used in &quot;industry&quot;.

 &gt; &gt; How do you envision the suggestion to appear? Semantic relationships
 &gt; &gt; are useful for many purposes, but the poor programmer left to
 &gt; &gt; implement the specification needs a few suggestions. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Using Hixie's proposed combinator:
 &gt; 
 &gt;    output[for]:hover /for/ *,
 &gt;    output[for]:focus /for/ * {
 &gt;      outline: invert dashed;
 &gt;    }
 &gt; 
 &gt; CSS Selectors v. 3.5? :)

And until then we hardcode a solution? I'd drop the &quot;for&quot; attribute in
the first round.

 &gt; &gt;  &gt; UA implementors should divine appropriate behaviour by reverse
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; engineering existing products and attempting to emulate their
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; behaviour.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Strike divine. Remember, browsers are monolithic dinosaurs with whom
 &gt; &gt; no divine being would ever associate. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; It's being used as a verb, meaning it takes this definition:
 &gt; 
 &gt; v. tr.
 &gt;     1. To foretell through or as if through the art of divination.
 &gt;     2.
 &gt;           1. To know by inspiration, intuition, or reflection.
 &gt;           2. To guess.
 &gt;     3. To locate (underground water or minerals) with a divining rod; douse.

Ah, no divine guidance available, back to reverse-engineering... :)

 &gt; &gt;  &gt; Note: To prevent an attribute from being processed in this way, put
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; a non-breaking zero-width space character (&amp;#xFEFF;) at the start
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; of the attribute. When the template is cloned, that character will
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; be removed, but any other text in the attribute will be left alone.
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; This could be useful if you have no control over the rest of the
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; contents in the attribute, e.g. if it is user configurable text.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Why do we need this (arguably ugly hack) when the page author is free
 &gt; &gt; to select a value for the ID attribute? Surely, it must be possible to
 &gt; &gt; find a unique name? And, if curly brackets appear around a undefined
 &gt; &gt; name no processing will occur, right?
 &gt; 
 &gt; They're square brackets, actually.

Sorry, yes, I meant square brackets. Making them curly may, as you
say, be a good idea. However, I still don't see the need for &amp;#xFEFF;
though.

 &gt; &gt;    &lt;tr index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &gt; &gt;    &lt;tr id=&quot;order&quot; repeat=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; The &quot;repeat&quot; attribute indicates that the element is a template. In
 &gt; &gt; HTML, the syntax can further be shortened:
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;    &lt;tr id=&quot;order&quot; repeat&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; That won't work. The shortened syntax in HTML means that
 &gt; 'repeat' is the *value* of some attribute, not the name
 &gt; of some attribute. E.g.
 &gt; 
 &gt;    &lt;table border&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; is equivalent to
 &gt; 
 &gt;    &lt;table frame=&quot;border&quot;&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; not
 &gt; 
 &gt;    &lt;table border=&quot;&quot;&gt;

This works in my browser:

  &lt;table border&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;foo
  &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;table border=5&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;foo
  &lt;/table&gt;

Even if we have to make up a dummy attribute to allow the short form
to pass through SGML validators, I think it's worth it.

 &gt; &gt;  &gt; Prefilled rows can contain any content; it need not match the
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; template. In order to be considered a part of the repetition model,
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; however, the row must have a repeat attribute with a numeric value.
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; That value can be any integer. (For example, you could use &quot;-1&quot; as
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; the value of all prefilled rows.)
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; I don't understand why it must not be a valid index.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I don't understand what you're pointing out here.

According to the text, -1 is an acceptable value for the &quot;repeat&quot;
attribute. I don't understand why it must not be an index (which, I
presume, can only be 0 ... n).

 &gt; &gt; The repeat model is complex. Could we make is slightly simple by
 &gt; &gt; &quot;dropping the repeat-template attribute?
 &gt; 
 &gt; The repeat model, according to Mark Schenk, is not flexible enough
 &gt; as it is. He's got a great use case, I'll let him explain. :)

I'll just sit back and wait :)
