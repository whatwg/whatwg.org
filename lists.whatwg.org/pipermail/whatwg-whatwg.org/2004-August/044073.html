Which isn't the case in any of these combined controls...  so I don't
think that's a good argument.

</I>
No, I've made no comment on X-Forms, I don't like XForms, but not
liking XForms doesn't mean I have to agree with this.

&gt;<i> If it wasn't for IE, we wouldn't have to even _consider_ abusing &lt;object&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> so I don't really see your point here anyway.
</I>
Wouldn't we?  I certainly would, Unlike most people I care about
degrading on all old UA's, not just IE6, you seem to think everyone
upgrades immediately, but I don't, not least because I know there's no
way I can update my copy of Opera to something newer, I'm sure other
people are in similar positions.

&gt;<i> &gt; I much prefer it to overloading INPUT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One possibility that has been risen (and which will be considered to WF3

</I>&gt;<i> a new element for the date/time controls. That would be preferable to the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt; solution.
</I>
Perhaps, so why not do it now?  you're suggesting we create as a
standard something now that we know is wrong, why not do it right in
the first place?

&gt;<i> But we shouldn't try to solve problems that aren't obviously problems. It
</I>&gt;<i> isn't clear to me that the current date/time fields have inadequate

</I>
Yes, but it is clear to me, but we've been over this...

Jim.
