Oh I totally agree, it's just one of what must be a number of 
complementary aspects to protect file upload controls.


&gt;<i> Given this example, I say the statement that file controls should not be

</I>&gt;<i> style the file upload control.
</I>
The argument that UAs use is the one I gave -- they are worried about 
people being tricked.


&gt;<i> If there were a standardized way to style this control, it would help 
</I>&gt;<i> the appearance of web apps.  If we are to make web apps &quot;first-rate 
</I>&gt;<i> citizens&quot;, the ability to change even the simplest thing such as the 
</I>&gt;<i> font in the file upload control would allow the ability to lend more 
</I>&gt;<i> uniformity to the application.
</I>
Native applications rarely change their fonts to be different than the 
native UI, actually, so this is not necessarily a good argument.


&gt;<i> Native apps have the ability now to create any sort of file upload 
</I>&gt;<i> control using whatever style is desired - why can't &quot;first-rate&quot; web 
</I>&gt;<i> apps?
</I>
Because native apps are fully trusted, while HTML applications don't have 
that level of trust, even when run in their own window.


In any case, styling of controls is an issue more relevant to the CSS 
working group (although WHATWG might eventually address this in the Web 
Controls spec, if the W3C doesn't get there first).

Cheers,
