&quot;An HTML user agent is any device that interprets HTML documents. User 
agents include visual browsers (text-only and graphical), non-visual 
browsers (audio, Braille), search robots, proxies, etc.&quot; 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/conform.html#didx-user_agent">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/conform.html#didx-user_agent</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> and I'm not sure if rendering HTML as HTML is really rendering at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from that, I doubt anyone needs access keys enabled from within 
</I>&gt;<i> search result summaries.
</I>
Which, I think, was exactly Ian's point. You can't require a particular 
rendering from a user agent (such as Googlebot) that doesn't render. 
And you shouldn't require a particular rendering in a context (such as 
search results) that is inappropriate.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  With the factory settings of Windows 2000 and later, rendering 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accesskeys &quot;in a way that is consistent with the native operating 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system or platform UI conventions&quot; means hiding them until Alt is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pressed, and in Mac OS X it usually means not rendering them at all.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>    Personally, I think this is a mistake on the part of operating 
</I>&gt;<i> system vendors.
</I>
(FWIW, I used to think the same thing.
&lt;<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25894#c4">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25894#c4</A>&gt;
&lt;<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25894#c20">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25894#c20</A>&gt;)

&gt;<i> What's the point of access keys if no one knows what they are?
</I>
&quot;No-one&quot; is an exaggeration; the point is to make them *difficult* to 
know, so as to maximize the productivity of the population as a whole. 
People who are unable to use a pointing device efficiently (e.g. 
disabled people, or people with very badly-designed or -configured 
pointing devices) will still put in the effort to learn them, but 
people who can use a pointing device efficiently will not be lured into 
regular use of a GUI activation mechanism which they think is faster 
but usually isn't.

&gt;<i> This problem is only made worse by Ian's idea of automatically 
</I>&gt;<i> resolving access key conflicts between the web page and the browser. 
</I>&gt;<i> If the user can't see the auto-selected access key, how can they 
</I>&gt;<i> possibly know what key to press?
</I>
That's partly why I don't think that idea is a good one. Even if you 
memorized the access key for a particular control, it might change on 
the next page.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There might be cases where a prompt is not the worst possible 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution to an interface design problem. But I don't think this is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I've made other suggestions, like having an &quot;access key mode&quot;, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I've heard little regarding these suggestions,
</I>
Invisible (or near-invisible) modes are bad firstly because people 
switch modes by accident (or start in the wrong mode) and don't realize 
until too late; and secondly because part of a person's short-term 
memory needs to be reserved for remembering which mode they're in, 
rather than used for working on the problem at hand. For a few people 
(e.g. vi users) the efficiency they get in return is worth it, but not 
for most people.

&gt;<i> and no one seems to be coming up with any other ideas.
</I>
I still like my idea of deprecating the thing. :-)
