<PRE>I've spent some time reading through WF2 (as per 22 July 2004) and my
comments for parts 1-3 follow below. As it stands, the specification
is an impressive piece of work and I think it will become a
cornerstone of the web. I apologize if my issues have been discussed
at length on this list in the past.

 &gt;  (although not necessarily structured XML submission).

I suggest: structured -&gt; arbitrary

 &gt; The majority of the features that XForms supports using declarative
 &gt; syntax are, in this specification, handled by using scripting.

I disagree. Most features are described declaratively in both
specifications. WF2 may resort to scripting in a few places where
XForms remain declarative, but on the whole WF2 is also a declarative
language.

 &gt; Compliant UAs must implement all the requirements of those
 &gt; specifications to claim compliance to this one.

Is this requirement a bit too ambitious? Are there any compliant HTML4
implementation out there (as per Ian Hickson's reading of the specs :)?

 &gt; Implementations may optionally implement only one of HTML4 and XHTML1.1.

I misunderstood the above sentence. By folding it into the previous
paragraph it will be better understood.

 &gt; Note: Documents that use the new features described in this
 &gt; specification cannot be strictly conforming XHTML or HTML4
 &gt; documents, since they contain features not defined in those
 &gt; specifications.

Right. I understand the distinction between conforming documents and
conforming UAs, but I fear the above will appear inconsistent compared
to the requirements on &quot;compliant UAs&quot; above.

 &gt; The children of a form element must be block-level elements, unless
 &gt; one of the ancestors of the form element is a td, th, li, dd, or
 &gt; block-level element other than div, in which case either
 &gt; block-level or inline-level content is allowed.

Why do they need to be block-level? 

I don't like the &lt;p&gt; tags in the examples; this is not a paragraph:

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;
     Quantity:
     &lt;input name=&quot;count&quot; type=&quot;number&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;99&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


 &gt; with the time zone set to UTC

I see the need for a UTC-based value, but expect the &quot;local&quot; variety
to be more used. How about calling them &quot;datetime&quot; and &quot;datetime-UTC&quot;?

 &gt; This type is used most frequently for dates in European industry.

editorial: &quot;European industry&quot; -&gt; &quot;Europe&quot;. 

BTW, my emacs call week numbers &quot;ISO date&quot;.

 &gt; UAs should make it clear to the user that the time does not carry
 &gt; any time zone information.

Again, I would reverse it: it's easier to communicate that something
is UTC (by showing those three letters) than to say that a time &quot;does
not carry any time zone information&quot;.


 &gt; rogue user agents

Editorial: &quot;non-conforming user agents&quot;

 &gt; A field with a max less than its min can never be satisfied and
 &gt; thus must block a form from being submitted. This does not make the
 &gt; document non-conformant.

Why not?

 &gt; For the control to be valid, the control's value must be an
 &gt; integral number of steps from the min value, or, if there is no min
 &gt; attribute, the max value, or if there is neither attribute, from
 &gt; zero.

I may be confused by some key terms: valid vs. conformant vs.
successful. May I suggest a short definition up front somewhere?

 &gt; For the following control, the allowed values are fifteen seconds
 &gt; and two tenths of a second past the minute, any minute of the day,
 &gt; i.e. 00:00:15.2, 00:01:15.2, 00:02:15.2 ... 23:59:15.2:
 &gt;
 &gt; &lt;input type=&quot;time&quot; min=&quot;00:00:15.20&quot; name=&quot;t&quot;&gt;

Really? You are saying that each value fragment (hour, minute, second,
second fragment) is evaluated independently? Wouldn't it be more
useful to consider the value as one where 'min=&quot;00:00:15.20&quot;' means
that all these values are allowed:

 00:00:15.20
 00:00:15.21
 00:00:15.22
 ..
 00:00:16.00
 00:00:16.01
 ..
 00:01:00.00
 ..

 &gt; For date controls, the value is in days, weeks, or months, for the
 &gt; date, week, and month types respectively. The format is an integer;
 &gt; one or more digits 0-9 interpreted as base ten.

Are negative values allowed? I would think not, and this should be noted.

 &gt; For numeric controls (number and range), the format is the number
 &gt; format described above, except that the value must be greater than
 &gt; zero.

Editorial: a bit more context would be helpful here. I suggest: &quot;...
the format of the step attribute is the number ...&quot;

 &gt; When a control has a list attribute, the list of author-specified
 &gt; autocompletion values shall be given by the list of elements that
 &gt; would be found by first calling getElementById() ...

This is the start of a difficult description. Why not just say that 

  &quot;The value of the list attribute is the ID of a datalist element which
  contains a list of author-specified autocompletion values&quot;.

If this is too simple and the complex description is necessary, I
suggest softening it by stating that the list attribute &quot;points to&quot; a
list of values, rather than &quot;specify a list of values&quot;

 &gt;  (This data is not made available to the page DOM.)

Remove parenthesis

 &gt; The UA could hove used a rotary control,

spelling: hove -&gt; have


 &gt; User agents may use this list to suggest to users the relevant
 &gt; parts of the document with which the user should interact to change
 &gt; the value.

How do you envision the suggestion to appear? Semantic relationships
are useful for many purposes, but the poor programmer left to
implement the specification needs a few suggestions. 

 &gt; The min and max attributes apply to file upload controls and
 &gt; specify (as positive integers) how many files must be attached for
 &gt; the control to be valid.

Did you mean &quot;successful&quot; instead of &quot;valid&quot;? 

 &gt; In this way, the accept attribute may be used to specify that the
 &gt; server is expecting an image, a sound clip, a video, etc, without
 &gt; specifying the exact list of types.

I suggest: 

  In this way, the accept attribute may be used to specify that the
  server is expecting (say) images or sound clips, without specifying
  the exact list of types.


 &gt; In HTML4, this attribute only applied to the text and password types.

The above text is marked up as a note, which is inconsistent with other
similar sentences.


Compare these two:

 &gt; Authors should include a description of the pattern in the title attribute. 

 &gt; When a control has a pattern attribute, the title attribute, if
 &gt; used, must describe the pattern.

They are saying slightly different things in slightly different ways.
I suggest keeping the first and striking the second.

 &gt; In this example, each row contains one form, even though without
 &gt; this attribute it would not be possible to have more than one form
 &gt; per table if any of them spanned cells.

I suggest:

 In this example, each row contains one form. Without the &quot;form&quot;
 attribute, it would not be possible to have more than one form per
 table if any of them spanned cells.

 &gt; User agent implementors may curse authors who violate these rules,
 &gt; and may persecute them to the full extent allowed by applicable
 &gt; international law.

:<i>-)
</I>
 &gt; UA implementors should divine appropriate behaviour by reverse
 &gt; engineering existing products and attempting to emulate their
 &gt; behaviour.

Strike divine. Remember, browsers are monolithic dinosaurs with whom
no divine being would ever associate. 

 &gt; ...except that then the names would all be the same -- all rows
 &gt; would be &quot;row0&quot;, so there would be no clear way of distinguishing
 &gt; which &quot;quantity&quot; went with which &quot;product&quot; except by the order in
 &gt; which they were submitted.

This is a non-normative part of the spec, but I suggest making the
language slightly more formal. 

 &gt; Note: To prevent an attribute from being processed in this way, put
 &gt; a non-breaking zero-width space character (&amp;#xFEFF;) at the start
 &gt; of the attribute. When the template is cloned, that character will
 &gt; be removed, but any other text in the attribute will be left alone.
 &gt; This could be useful if you have no control over the rest of the
 &gt; contents in the attribute, e.g. if it is user configurable text.

Why do we need this (arguably ugly hack) when the page author is free
to select a value for the ID attribute? Surely, it must be possible to
find a unique name? And, if curly brackets appear around a undefined
name no processing will occur, right?

 &gt; &lt;tr repeat=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &gt; &lt;tr id=&quot;order&quot; repeat=&quot;template&quot; repeat-start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

I don't like the name of the repeat-* attributes. I suggest these names instead:

   &lt;tr index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr id=&quot;order&quot; repeat=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

The &quot;repeat&quot; attribute indicates that the element is a template. In
HTML, the syntax can further be shortened:

   &lt;tr id=&quot;order&quot; repeat&gt;

repeat-min and repeat-max remain unchanged.

 &gt; Repetition templates can also be nested. The concept of hierarchy
 &gt; is expected to be represented in the names, as it is today in
 &gt; hand-rolled repeating forms, as in:

Editorial: Avoid &quot;hand-rolled&quot;, this can confuse non-native speakers. I suggest:

  Repetition templates can also be nested. The concept of hierarchy is
  expected to be represented in the names, as in today's repeating
  HTML forms.


 &gt; Prefilled rows can contain any content; it need not match the
 &gt; template. In order to be considered a part of the repetition model,
 &gt; however, the row must have a repeat attribute with a numeric value.
 &gt; That value can be any integer. (For example, you could use &quot;-1&quot; as
 &gt; the value of all prefilled rows.)

I don't understand why it must not be a valid index.

 &gt; (although of course this may be further overriden by the stylesheet)

Editorial: drop &quot;of course&quot;

The repeat model is complex. Could we make is slightly simple by
dropping the repeat-template attribute?
