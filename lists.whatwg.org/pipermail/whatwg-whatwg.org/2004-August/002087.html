So you are acting within WHAT-WG as a representative of Opera, and not
as an individual, is that what you're saying?

&gt;<i> &gt; Could you explain why not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because I don't see any way that WHATWG's copyright status is &quot;urgent&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't see how it could possibly be more important than any of the
</I>&gt;<i> other things that Opera's legal team is involved with.
</I>
&gt;<i>From Opera's perspective certainly not, however from WHAT-WG's
</I>perspective, then all of Operas other stuff is irrelevant - obviously
they as wholly independant from the WHAT-WG can take as long as they
want, I simply asked for you to request an urgent response under your
role as spokesperson for the WHAT-WG work.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you also please request that you are allowed to post their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; response to the mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; No.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you explain why not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>
This doesn't seem particularly open?

&gt;<i> &gt; No, I know, I asked you to confirm to me that you did - something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you've still not done - can you confirm to me that the licence given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the WHAT-WG and others to use and re-licence Opera copyright
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; material is something you have in writing and would be producible in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any future court case rising from Opera (or future owners of its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content) revoking the licence?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, of course I have the license in writing. So do you. It's written
</I>&gt;<i> right at the top of every WHATWG spec, and I even sent it to this list.
</I>
No, that is not what I asked, I asked that you had Opera's intention
and lawyer advice that the WHAT-WG documents be provided under that
licence in writing, and if you are able to produce that in a court at
a future date if Opera (or the future copyright owners) decide to
revoke that licence.

&gt;<i> Just for kicks, could you outline how it could become in Opera's best
</I>&gt;<i> interests to prevent whatever it is that revoking this license would
</I>&gt;<i> prevent?
</I>
Any successful product has the ability to make money for the owners of
a product in a number of ways, there's lots of ways that ownership of
the specification by a single vendor could be used.

&gt;<i> Could you also point me to the relevant part of the equivalent W3C
</I>&gt;<i> licenses that protect you from such license grant revocation when it comes
</I>&gt;<i> to W3C specifications?
</I>
The W3C doesn't licence such blanket derivative works of its
specifications, for a very good reason, as to the seperate issue of
ownership, I believe I'd already explained why a consortium that
anyone can join is reasonable protection, whereas a single company in
the industry is something to be more concerned with.

Jim.
