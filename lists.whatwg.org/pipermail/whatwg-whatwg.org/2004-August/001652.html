</I>
    It has been suggested (I think by Ian) that there be an attribute 
for the &lt;html&gt; element that indicates if the web page is a web 
application that requires a chromeless window. A compliant browser could 
process such a page with something similar to pop-up blocking, and if 
the user permits, the page would be displayed without chrome regardless 
of how it was opened.

&gt;&gt;<i>    Then again, I've seen Java applications in a browser that have such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> menubars, so there may be a demand for this. Another thing is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone may want to create a simulated desktop interface where they can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open multiple &quot;windows&quot; within the browser windows. In that case, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be nice if these window-like blocks could have their own  menubars.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't make sense on those platforms where applications have menu  
</I>&gt;<i> bars but windows do not.
</I>
    It does if you want to simulate your own desktop interface, which is 
the example I gave above. The webmaster may want a unique look and feel 
that don't belong to any specific operating system.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, making &lt;menubar&gt; &quot;look like a menu bar&quot; would involve  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having two or more visually similar menu bars on the screen  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simultaneously. But this is bizarre behavior on some platforms, and  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even on platforms where it is expected behavior, it is highly  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> confusing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    One thing we could do is come up with a way to display menubars on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few key operating systems that doesn't confuse users, then allow enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> room in the spec for user agent vendors to create their own solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO allowing &quot;user agent vendors to create their own solutions&quot; is a  
</I>&gt;<i> copout from admitting that there is no practical solution for the  
</I>&gt;<i> platforms some user agents are running on, which is bad for  
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability.
</I>
    I'm not arrogant enough to think that I can always come up with a 
better UI solution than vendors for a specific platform, nor do I 
believe we can necessarily come up with the presentation details for 
menubars on every operating system that existed or will exist. Write the 
specification so that there is a RECOMMENDED solution for key operating 
systems, then make the specification loose enough so that it can be 
implemented without tying the hands of vendors that might have a better 
solution.

&gt;<i> (For an example of such silliness, see  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-color-20030514/#flavor">http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-color-20030514/#flavor</A>&gt;.) There's no  
</I>&gt;<i> point in providing freedom to choose, if the number of practical  
</I>&gt;<i> choices is zero.
</I>
    Prove that the choices are zero on all platforms.


&gt;&gt;<i>    Furthermore, HTML 4.01 allows support for &lt;link&gt; to implemented in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any way the UA vendor chooses,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is partly why authors don't use it.
</I>
    Some do, but they don't rely on it as a general menu system.

&gt;&gt;<i> so suddenly turning &lt;link&gt; into a menu system could cause serious  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like it becoming useful, perhaps. :-)
</I>
    How about the fact that existing &lt;link&gt; elements are not necessarily 
ordered in a way that the webmaster might want them in a menu because 
many browsers group specific kinds of &lt;link&gt; elements in a predetermined 
fashion? What if the webmaster defines them in the order of { Last, 
Bottom, Next, First, Previous, Top }? I wouldn't want it to show up in a 
menu like that. But in current browsers, there's absolutely no reason 
not to put items in random order.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is especially true if a browser vendor chose to put &lt;link&gt; items  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a submenu off the main browser menu.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't remember anyone on this list suggesting that. Hiding them in a  
</I>&gt;<i> menu would certainly fail my &quot;reliably noticable&quot; criterion  
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/">http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> 001197.html&gt;.
</I>
    I was referring to how a vendor implemented the HTML 4.01 
specification, not something you invented for the mailing list. If a UA 
vendor implemented support for link in a submenu, that existing browser 
will have to be modified to remove the submenu and add some new 
implementation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That would suit the usual use case for adjacent menus, and would  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> avoid wrongly implying that it should look like a native menu bar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    On a chromeless window, it probably SHOULD look like a native  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> menubar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, because that would (on some platforms) still involve having two or  
</I>&gt;<i> more visually similar menu bars on the screen simultaneously.
</I>
    Seeing as the window would be chromeless, I don't understand how.

&gt;&gt;<i> Keep in mind, an element name like &quot;menubar&quot; or &quot;menulist&quot; can  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicate more than just visual position. Native menubar rendering  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a chromeless window, for instance, would be impossible without 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such  an element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what you're trying to say here.
</I>
    Good example would be MS Office for Windows (and maybe Mac too, but 
I wouldn't know). Look at the menubar. See the little grippy? Grab it 
and you can put the menu on the sides of the window, or on the bottom, 
or make it a menu in a little floating toolbox.

    Furthermore, without a parent tag, there's no semantic connection 
between the separate menu items.

&gt;&gt;<i>    I don't mind presenting &lt;menu&gt; as a button when not in the context
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of  a menubar. However, should this be required in the spec, or simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommended?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How strongly the Web Apps spec suggests particular visual presentation  
</I>&gt;<i> is suggested for &lt;menu&gt; probably depends on how strongly the What-WG  
</I>&gt;<i> specs suggest particular visual presentation for controls in general. I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't think Ian has said anything about that yet.
</I>
    I think that's because we're supposed to talk about instead of 
having Ian unilaterally decide for us.

&gt;&gt;<i>    You're confusing the implementation of a drop-down list for &lt;select&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the &lt;select&gt; element itself. The &lt;select&gt; element could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented in a manner similar to that shown in the HTML 4.01
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specification, for instance:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/images/optgroup_exmpl.gif">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/images/optgroup_exmpl.gif</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    The &lt;select&gt; element could be implemented as a pull-down menu.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be even worse, but in a different way: it would mean in some  
</I>&gt;<i> cases the current selection wasn't visible at all even immediately  
</I>&gt;<i> after the menu was opened. For example, someone who chose &quot;Uzbekistan&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> by mistake instead of &quot;USA&quot; would have to scroll through (nearly) the  
</I>&gt;<i> whole damn menu of countries again, instead of mousing down on the menu  
</I>&gt;<i> and dragging northward ~5 pixels. (On the Windows platform, and in  
</I>&gt;<i> Gecko on all platforms, decrementing a &lt;select&gt; value is more  
</I>&gt;<i> time-consuming -- you need to click the menu, then move down(!) to  
</I>&gt;<i> click the up arrow, then move across to click the correct item. But  
</I>&gt;<i> that's still not as bad as a pull-down menu would be.)
</I>
    In most &lt;select&gt; implementations, you can simply use the arrows to 
select the next or previous item. This behavior would not have to change 
to use a popup menu instead of a drop-down list. There's also nothing 
stopping vendors from opening up the entire menu to the location of the 
selected item and moving the mouse pointer to a position over that item.

&gt;<i> That's probably why no toolkit I know of presents any of its  
</I>&gt;<i> one-of-many selection controls (listboxes, scrolling listboxes, option  
</I>&gt;<i> menus, or sets of radiobuttons) in the way the W3C illustrates. It  
</I>&gt;<i> would be far too annoying.
</I>
    So it can't be done because you've never seen it done?

&gt;&gt;<i> Besides, in the context of using &lt;select&gt; WITHIN &lt;menu&gt;, a pull-down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> menu would almost certainly be used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but that's not what was being discussed.
</I>
    By making &lt;optgroup&gt; non-nesting, you make the &lt;select&gt;-based 
solution that's in the current WA1 spec useless for menus more than two 
levels deep. The subjects of &lt;optgroup&gt; nesting and WA1 menus are related.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another reason not to have &lt;optgroup&gt;s inside &lt;select&gt;s is that  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> option menus are supposed to show their state even when closed, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they cannot do so reliably if two or more submenus contain items 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with  the same text.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Easy to fix. Display the &lt;option&gt; |label| as in the menu and the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> child text of the &lt;option&gt; as the selection. This is consistent with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the example from section 17.6.1 of the HTML 4.01 spec:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, &quot;the distinction could not be shown in a single  
</I>&gt;<i> native-looking option menu while the menu was closed, without making  
</I>&gt;<i> the menu abnormally wide&quot;. The W3C's example uses abnormally short  
</I>&gt;<i> submenu items in an attempt to make &lt;optgroup&gt; look practically  
</I>&gt;<i> implementable.
</I>
    How would any of the selection be narrower in any other type of 
control that's one line of text high when closed? You'd have to have a 
tree of some kind, which is kinda silly if you're selecting something 
from a group of categories and subcategories that aren't necessarily in 
the name of the item. For instance, my car is a 1994 Subaru SVX Lsi:

Subaru-&gt;Car-&gt;Sports Car-&gt;SVX-&gt;Lsi-&gt;1994

    By your reasoning, the selection would read:

&quot;Subaru - Car - Sports Car - SVX - Lsi - 1994&quot;

    In reality, it would simply be &quot;1994 Subaru SVX Lsi&quot;. That's the 
whole reason there's a separate |label| property. The W3C wanted you to 
make the selection name different from the menu name so that the actual 
text node under the &lt;option&gt; could exclude unnecessary information about 
the submenu titles, allowing the web master to avoid large 
treeview-style controls.
