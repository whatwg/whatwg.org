It's not the same.  Please look at how ISO-2022 works: the stream has
*long-lived* state, with escape sequences that change the meaning of later
code sequences in the stream.  For example, you have to remember whether GR
is encoding G1, G2 or G3.  This can't be stored merely by remembering the
next input byte you have to start at.

As Yui said, the sort of state UTF-8 has isn't what people mean when we
talk about &quot;stateful encodings&quot;.

You don't need to do that.  You can simply convert as many output
codepoints as can be *completely* converted.  In this example, you'd
consume 3 bytes and output one codepoint.  You don't consume data that you
can't immediately convert, so you don't have to buffer anything.

(We don't have to do it that way, of course; just pointing out that you
don't *need* special state for streaming encodings like UTF-8.)

Anyway, they need error if the byte sequence is invalid for the encoding.

Errors were discussed previously: by default errors output U+FFFD (or
another replacement character, for encoding unsupported characters to
non-Unicode encodings), and we may have an option to turn it into an
exception.
