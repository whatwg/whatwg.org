<PRE>I was initially on the &quot;just make it little endian and don't make me worry
about it&quot; side of the fence, but on further careful consideration I've
changed my mind: I think having typed arrays use the platform endianness is
the right call.

As Ken pointed out, if you are populating your arrays from javascript or a
JSON file or something similar this is a non-issue. The problem only occurs
when you are attempting to load a binary blob directly into a typed array.
Unless that blob is entirely homogenous (ie: all Float32's or all Int16's,
etc) it's impossible to trivially swap endianness without being provided a
detailed breakdown of the data patterns contained within the blob.

Consider this example (using WebGL, but the same could apply elsewhere): I
download a binary file containing tightly packed interleaved vertices that
I want to pass directly to a WebGL buffer. The data contains little endian
vertex positions, texture coordinates, texture ID's and a 32 bit color per
vertex, so the data looks something like this:

struct {
    Float32[3] pos,
    Float32[4] uv,
    Uint16 textureId,
    Uint32 color
};

I will receive this data from XHR as an opaque TypedArray, and if the
platform is little endian I can pass it directly to the GPU. But on big
endian systems, a translation needs to be done somewhere:

xhr.responseType = &quot;arraybuffer&quot;;
xhr.onload = function() {
    var vertBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
    gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, vertBuffer);

    // If bigEndian then... magic!

    gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, this.response, gl.STATIC_DRAW);
}

So the question is: What exactly are we expecting that &quot;magic&quot; to be? We
can't just swizzle every 4 bytes. Either the graphics driver must do the
endian swap as it processes the buffer, which is possible but entirely out
of the browsers control, or we would have to provide data packing
information to the browser so that it could do the appropriate swap for us.
And if I'm going to have to build up a data definition and pass that
through to the browser anyway... well I've just destroyed the whole &quot;don't
make me care about endianness&quot; ideal, haven't I? I might as well just do
the swap in my own code via a DataView, or better yet cache a big endian
version of the same file on the server side if I'm worried about
performance.

So yeah, it sucks that we have to plan for devices that are practically
non-existant and difficult to test for, but I don't really see a nicer
(practical) solution.

That said, one thing that DataView doesn't handle too nicely right now is
arrays. You're basically stuck for-looping over your data, even if it's all
the same type. I would fully support having new DataView methods available
like:

Int32Array getInt32Array(unsigned long byteOffset, unsigned long elements,
optional boolean littleEndian);

Which would be a nice, sensible optimization since I'm pretty sure the
browser backend could do that faster than a JS loop.

</I>&gt;<i> information about how vertex attributes use buffer data must be known.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. In webgl.bufferData implementation, don't call glBufferData, instead

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. In webgl.vertexAttribPointer, record the attributes structure (their
</I>&gt;<i> types, how they use buffer data). Do not convert/upload buffers yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. In the first WebGL draw call (like webgl.drawArrays) since the last
</I>&gt;<i> bufferData/vertexAttribPointer call, do the conversion of buffers and the
</I>&gt;<i> glBufferData calls. Use some heuristics to drop the buffer data cache, as
</I>&gt;<i> most WebGL apps will not have a use for it anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would never be possible to drop the CPU side buffer data cache. A

</I>&gt;<i> differently for the same buffer object, which would necessitate going
</I>&gt;<i> back through the buffer's data and generating new, appropriately
</I>&gt;<i> byte-swapped data for the GPU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In practice, if forced to implement a UA on a big-endian system today, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would likely pick option (C)....  I wouldn't classify that as a victory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for standardization, but I'm also not sure what we can do at this point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to fix the brokenness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that seems to be the only way to support universal webgl content
</I>&gt;<i> on big-endian UAs. It's not great due to the memory overhead, but at least
</I>&gt;<i> it shouldn't incur a significant performance overhead, and it typically
</I>&gt;<i> only incurs a temporary memory overhead as we should be able to drop the
</I>&gt;<i> buffer data caches quickly in most cases. Also, buffers are typically 10x
</I>&gt;<i> smaller than textures, so the memory overhead would typically be ~ 10% in
</I>&gt;<i> corner cases where we couldn't drop the caches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our emails certainly crossed, but please refer to my other email.
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL applications that assemble vertex data for the GPU using typed
</I>&gt;<i> arrays will already work correctly on big-endian architectures. This
</I>&gt;<i> was a key consideration when these APIs were being designed. The
</I>&gt;<i> problems occur when binary data is loaded via XHR and uploaded to
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL directly. DataView is supposed to be used in such cases to load
</I>&gt;<i> the binary data, because the endianness of the file format must
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily be known.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The possibility of forcing little-endian semantics was considered when
</I>&gt;<i> typed arrays were originally being designed. I don't have absolute
</I>&gt;<i> performance numbers to quote you, but based on previous experience
</I>&gt;<i> with Java's NIO Buffer classes, I am positive that the performance
</I>&gt;<i> impact for WebGL applications on big-endian architectures would be
</I>&gt;<i> very large. It would prevent applications which manipulate vertices in
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript from running acceptably on big-endian machines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Ken
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In conclusion: WebGL is not the worst here, there is a pretty reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> avenue for big-endian UAs to implement it in a way that allows running the
</I>&gt;<i> same unmodified content as little-endian UAs.
