<PRE>
I just added a bunch of things to the &lt;canvas&gt; 2D API:

 - Path primitives:
     var p = new Path();
     p.rect(0,0,100,100);
     context.fill(p);

 - Ellipses:
     // arcs from center point, similar to arc()
     context.ellipse(x, y, width/2, height/2, angle, 0, Math.PI*2);
     context.stroke();
     // arc corners
     context.arcTo(x1, y1, x2, y2, width/2, height/2, angle);

  - SVG path description syntax
     context.stroke(new Path('M 100,100 h 50 v 50 h 50'));

  - Dashed lines
     context.setLineDash([3,1,0,1]); // --- . --- . --- .
     context.moveTo(100,100);
     context.lineTo(200,300);
     context.stroke();

 - Text on a path:
     var p1 = new Path('M 100 350 q 150 -300 300 0');
     var p2 = new Path();
     var styles = new DrawingStyle();
     styles.font = '20px sans-serif';
     p2.addText('Hello World', styles, null, p1);
     context.fill(p2);

  - Hit testing:
     context.beginPath();
     context.rect(10,10,100,100);
     context.fill();
     context.addHitRegion({ id: 'The First Button' });
     context.beginPath();
     context.rect(120,10,100,100);
     context.fill();
     context.addHitRegion({ id: 'The Second Button' });
     canvas.onclick = function (event) {
       if (event.region)
         alert('You clicked ' + event.region);
     });

  - Region discovery for AT users
     context.rect(10,100,100,50);
     context.fill();
     context.addHitRegion({
       id: 'button',
       control: canvas.getElementsByTagName('button')[0],
     });
     context.beginPath();
     context.rect(0,0,100,50);
     context.textAlign = 'center';
     context.textBaseline = 'top';
     context.fillText('My Game', 50, 0, 100);
     context.addHitRegion({
       id: 'header',
       label: 'My Game',
       role: 'heading',
     });
     // now user can discover (via touch on a touch device, or via the 
     // virtual cursor in a traditional desktop AT) that there's a heading 
     // at the top of the canvas that says &quot;My Game&quot; and a button lower 
     // down that looks (to the AT) exactly like the canvas element's
     // first child &lt;button&gt;.

  - Automatic cursor control
     context.addHitRegion({
       path: new Path('M 10 10 h 20 v 20 h -20 z'),
       cursor: 'url(fight.png)',
     });
     context.addHitRegion({
       path: new Path('M 50 30 h 20 v 20 h -20 z'),
       cursor: 'url(quaff.png)',
     });

  - APIs that take SVGMatrix objects for transforms
     // transform a path when you add it to another path
     var duck = new Path('M 0 0 c 40 48 120 -32 160 -6 c 0 0 5 4 10 '+ 
                         '-3 c 10 -103 50 -83 90 -42 c 0 0 20 12 30 7 c '+ 
                         '-2 12 -18 17 -40 17 c -55 -2 -40 25 -20 35 c '+
                         '30 20 35 65 -30 71 c -50 4 -170 4 -200 -79z');
     var identity = new SVGMatrix(); // constructor will be in SVG2 DOM
     var threeDucks = new Path();
     threeDucks.addPath(duck, identity.translate(0,0));
     threeDucks.addPath(duck, identity.translate(100,0));
     threeDucks.addPath(duck, identity.translate(200,0));

     // set the transform using an SVGMatrix
     cantext.currentTransform = context.currentTransform.flipX();

  - many more metrics from measureText()
     var metrics = context.measureText('Hello World');
     var bL = metrics.actualBoundingBoxLeft;
     var bR = metrics.actualBoundingBoxRight;
     var bU = metrics.actualBoundingBoxAscent;
     var bD = metrics.actualBoundingBoxDescent;
     context.fillStyle = 'black';
     context.fillRect(x-bL, y-bU, bL+bR, bU+bD);
     context.fillStyle = 'white';
     context.fillText(x, y, 'Hello World');
     // there are also values for all the baselines

  - ability to transform a pattern
     var identity = new SVGMatrix();
     context.fillStyle = context.createPattern(img, 'repeat');
     context.fillStyle.setTransform(identity.rotate(angle));
     context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  - various other additions
     // reset the clip region
     context.resetClip();
     // reset the transform
     context.resetTransform();


I include below responses to relevant feedback and to proposals that I 
have not added but do not intend to add or do not understand well enough 
to add. If I haven't replied to your feedback on canvas, that means it's 
about a feature I haven't added yet but do not see immediate problems 
with. (If you have sent feedback regarding bugs in canvas, or regarding 
some of the canvas features already in the spec and not asking for a new 
feature, but have not received a reply, then I may have missed it. Let me 
know and I'll see if it's been misfiled.)

If you mean path collision detection, I haven't added this, but the path 
objects we have now have lain the groundwork for this in the future: one 
can easily imagine adding a feature to this API that takes two Path 
objects and tells you if they intersect. If this is a feature that other 
people ask for, then I imagine we will add this in the next canvas feature 
update.

On the other hand, if you specifically meant collision detection for 
alpha-channel sprites, then I haven't added that yet either, but am 
unsure whether it makes much sense to add. Does anyone else (especially 
implementors) have any opinions on this matter?

You can now get a (live) SVGMatrix object representing the current

For the record, it's more productive to explain use cases that are not 
handled by the existing API than to propose changes to the API.

Please see this FAQ entry and the one that follows it:

I've added something along these lines (though more flexible) to the spec.

I haven't quite added what you suggest, but I have added Path primitives, 
which does more or less the same thing and can be passed to 
isPointInPath(), and also added a mechanism that more directly addresses 
your underlying request, namely a way to define hit regions and have them 
be directly reported in the mousedown event rather than having to go 
through each path in turn.

A mechanism to draw parts of the page to a canvas is one a lot of people 
would very much like to have. Unfortunately it's an incredibly difficult 
problem to solve in a way that doesn't introduce security flaws.

I added the control for drawImage() anyway, so that you don't have to rely 
on scaling canvas (which might result in a higher-res backing store or 
might not) to get the effect, and so that you can have some images (e.g. 
backgrounds) smoothed and others (e.g. foreground sprites) not.

This matches what the spec has done; you can make it also affect patterns 
if you like by first drawing the image scaled to another canvas and then 
using that as the pattern (so the pattern doesn't have to be scaled).

If you just have everything scaled, though, you might be better off just 
drawing everything to the canvas without any scaling and then just scaling 
the whole thing once per frame, either by stretching the canvas and 
relying on CSS to turn off smoothing, or by using drawImage().

I've added this to the spec as proposed here.

I agree with Darin's assessment here. Let me know if you still think the 
spec should be changed.

I presumed you meant a scrollbar drawn by the author. If that's not what 
you mean, I don't understand your proposal. Could you elaborate?

I'm not sure I follow. What is the use case you had in mind?
