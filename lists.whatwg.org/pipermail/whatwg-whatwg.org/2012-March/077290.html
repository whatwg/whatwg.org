<PRE>Thanks for commenting on my suggestion.

</I>Yes, this needs to be elaborated.

I think it makes sense to follow the rules in section 5.1.6 of the HTML5 
spec:
<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/browsers.html#the-rules-for-choosing-a-browsing-context-given-a-browsing-context-name">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/browsers.html#the-rules-for-choosing-a-browsing-context-given-a-browsing-context-name</A>


The rationale is that specifying &quot;Window-Target: foo&quot; for an HTML page 
has an effect similar to inserting &quot;window.open(location.href, 'foo')&quot; 
at the top of the page, so it should be subject to the same restrictions 
WRT navigating other browsing contexts.


&gt;<i> Content-Disposition seems like the &quot;correct&quot; header to use to me, but
</I>&gt;<i> using the previously implemented header is fair enough.
</I>&gt;<i> Window-Target and Content-Disposition must not appear in the same
</I>&gt;<i> message, as the semantics of the former are a subset of the semantics
</I>&gt;<i> of the latter AFAICT.
</I>AFAIK no modern browser implements Window-Target, so I don't think the
we need to reuse the old header name. Expanding Content-Disposition is
also an option, e.g. &quot;Content-Disposition: inline; target=_blank&quot;.
Unfortunately we cannot use &quot;Content-Disposition: _blank&quot;, because
unknown values (not &quot;attachment&quot; or &quot;inline&quot;) are treated as
&quot;attachment&quot; (RFC 2183, section 2.8).


&gt;<i> Separating the network protocol from the user interface seems highly
</I>&gt;<i> desirable. Window-Target sacrifices that.
</I>I get your point. But it seems that Content-Disposition already suffers
from this.

RFC 2183 describes the Content-Disposition like this:

   A mechanism is needed to allow the sender to transmit this sort of
   presentational information to the recipient; the Content-Disposition
   header provides this mechanism, allowing each component of a message
   to be tagged with an indication of its desired presentation semantics.

I know that RFC 2183 deals with e-mail and is not pat of HTTP/1.1, but
it is mentioned in the HTTP specification and is supported by several
browsers.


&gt;<i> Would it not be more appropriate to return an error response
</I>&gt;<i> clearly marked as such? That, however, would leave the issue of
</I>&gt;<i> connecting error messages to specific form fields.
</I>That would sacrifice the ability to show error messages, help texts in 
the same way as on other forms (if I understand you correctly). Of 
course you can make some AJAX foo, but this easily gets complicated.


&gt;&gt;<i> On &lt;a&gt; and &lt;form&gt; elements you can specify a target attribute, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _blank. But sometimes you don't know whether to open in _self or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _blank at the time the link is clicked/the form is submitted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The questions are, what information is necessary to decide whether to
</I>&gt;<i> reuse the browsing context or not, and what other decisions depend
</I>&gt;<i> on the said information?
</I>It may depend on something external, e.g. the submitted form values 
(e.g. username and password) compared against an external database, so 
it cannot be determined without actually submitting the form.
