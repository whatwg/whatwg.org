Does this make sense when you're using stream: false to flush the stream?
It's still a streaming operation.  I guess it's &quot;close enough&quot;.

* A |nullTerminator| option eliminates the need for a stringLength method
&gt;<i> (hasta la vista, baby!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I strongly disagree with this change.  It's much cleaner and more generic
for the decoding algorithm to not know anything about null terminators, and
to have separate general-purpose methods to determine the length of the
string (memchr/wmemchr analogs, which we should have anyway).  We made this
simplification a long time ago--why did you resurrect this?

array = new Int8Array(myArrayBuffer);
length = array.indexOf(0); // same semantics as String.indexOf
if(length != -1)
    array = array.subarray(0, length);
new TextDecoder('utf-8').decode(array);

* BOM handling needs to be resolved. The Encoding spec makes the encoding
&gt;<i> label secondary to the BOM. With this API it's unclear if that should be
</I>&gt;<i> the case. Options include having a mismatching BOM throw, treating a
</I>&gt;<i> mismatching BOM as a decoding error (i.e. fallback or throw, depending on
</I>&gt;<i> options), or allow the BOM to actually switch the decoder used for this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;stream&quot; - possibly if-and-only-if the default encoding was specified.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The path of fewest errors is probably to have a BOM override the specified
UTF-16 endianness, so saying &quot;UTF-16BE&quot; just changes the default.


An aside:

The TypedArray constructors have a depressing design bug: new
Int8Array(someOtherView) makes a copy of the data.  It's nonsensical that
view constructors create a view when passed an ArrayBuffer, but a copy when
passed another view.  This doesn't make any kind of sense; creating a view
should create a *view* if it's passed an object that already has
ArrayBuffer-based storage, and making a copy should have been its own
operation.

This means we can't say &quot;creating a view is cheap&quot;; we have to qualify it:
&quot;creating a view is cheap, as long as you're careful not to call a
constructor that makes a copy&quot;.

It's frustrating that we're now stuck with a confusing, inconsistent API
like this.  I'm sure it's much too late to fix this properly, but hopefully
an option can be added to fix it, so a new TypedArray(TypedArray, {view:
true}) call  actually creates a view.
