We think both those changes are required to handle all cases gracefully.

I'm not sure what you mean by that. As I mentioned, backingStorePixelRatio is in general not equal to devicePixelRatio. It's true that you might be able to infer the backing store scale by creating a canvas solely for testing, but that is needlessly awkward.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An automatically scaled backing store is better for authors, because for the case where they are not doing any direct pixel manipulation, they get higher quality visual results with no code changes on devices that scale CSS pixels. But to offer it, we need to take care of the compatibility issues, and also provide a path for authors who have gone the extra mile to hand-scale 1x backing stores on 2x devices. In other words, all the following cases need to work:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devicePixelRatio is 1; backingStorePixelRatio is 1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devicePixelRatio is 2; backingStorePixelRatio is 1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devicePixelRatio is 2; backingStorePixelRatio is 2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe even other possibilities. In other words, we don't want to force either the assumption that backingStorePixelRatio is always 1, or that it is always is equal to devicePixelRatio. We believe that in time, neither is a safe assumption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well if they --need-- to work, better to add the value sooner than later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My concern is that you've also got window.screen.logicalXPixelRatio on the desktop.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You'll really have three items now to add up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> devicePixelRatio * backingStorePixelRatio * logicalPixelRatio.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that middle item really necessary?
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't able to get anyone to budge on changing window.devicePixelRatio on the desktop. It's fixed at 1.
</I>
I was unable to decipher what IE's logical{X,Y}DPI does and how it differs from device{X,Y}DPI and for that matter system{X,Y}DPI. But I don't believe any of those things relate to the canvas backing store, however, so I don't see how they eliminate the need for backingStoreRatio.

Maciej
