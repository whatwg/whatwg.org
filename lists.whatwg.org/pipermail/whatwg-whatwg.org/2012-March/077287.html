Ah, but that is up to the user agent to decide how to show the time code.  
The currentTime should be normalized from 0 until duration. That makes the  
API behave in a common way for all easy tasks. If you write a video player  
for your small cat clip, that video player will also work with streaming  
video without any problem. That is a good thing.

However, the user agent is free to show you (the user) your &quot;real&quot;  
position. And I agree that doing that makes sense. They don't exclude  
eachother.

&gt;<i> Maybe &quot;joinTime&quot; or some other property could be added to hold that

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Only video player authors will actually see and use those attributes. They  
should be built for being robust and working nicely for different usages.  
Like I said, making the &quot;dumb video player&quot; also work for live streamed  
video without any changes.

If you want to do a more advanced media player that is live video  
streaming aware, you will have to opt-in to that instead. All the same is  
possible, only one way is more backward-proof than the other.

Philip J&#228;genstedt proposed &quot;offsetTime&quot; for what we've called &quot;startTime&quot;,  
which IMHO is a clearer name.


&gt;<i> In addition, I wonder if negative values for currentTime are legal. For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, when streaming a Formula 1 race that starts at 17.00, I would  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> be surprised to see negative currentTime if I join the stream before the
</I>&gt;<i> race starts.
</I>
They are not, and shouldn't be. currentTime is always normalized to 0 -&gt;  
duration.

However, you would be perfectly able to write a video player that does  
that by using offsetTime and currentTime together. Even better, the  
proposed &quot;currentDate&quot; exposes the underlying &quot;date of recording&quot; (or  
similar date) of the media, which you can then just look for 2012-03-08  
17:00. Actually, you could also build your video player to show that date  
on-screen, because 17:00 on the screen might be 18:13 at my place, because  
a) I'm in a different time zone, and b) there's 13 minutes worth of  
buffering between the Formula 1 production cameras and my computer.
