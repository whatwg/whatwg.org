Seems reasonable. If we have specific use cases for non-UTF-8 encodings, I 
agree we should support them; if that's the case, we should survey those 
use cases to work out what the set of encodings we need is, and add just 
those.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   separate from the mechanism that lets you encode the string and get the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   that for some encodings getting the encoded length is much quicker than

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The use case was to compute the size necessary to allocate a single buffer

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ignoring the issue of invalid code points, the length calculations for

</I>
Yeah, but surely we'll mainly be doing stuff with UTF-8...

One option is to return an opaque object of the form:

   interface EncodedString {
     readonly attributes unsigned long length;
     // internally has a copy of the encoded string
   }

...and then have view.setString take this EncodedString object. At least 
then you get it down to an extraneous copy, rather than an extraneous 
encode. Still not ideal though.


&gt;<i> &gt;  - Seems weird that integers and strings would have such different APIs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   for doing the same thing. Why can't we handle them equivalently? As in:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     len = view.setString(strings[i],
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                          offset + Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                          &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     view.setUint32(offset, len);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     offset += Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT + len;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Heh, that's where the discussion started, actually. We wanted to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> the DataView interface simple, and potentially support encoding into 
</I>&gt;<i> plain JS arrays and/or non-TypedArray support that appeared to be on the 
</I>&gt;<i> horizon for JS.
</I>
I see where you're coming from, but I think we should look at the platform 
as a whole, not just one API. It doesn't help the platform as a whole if 
we just have the same features split across two interfaces, the complexity 
is even slightly higher than just having one consistent API that does ints 
and strings equivalently.
