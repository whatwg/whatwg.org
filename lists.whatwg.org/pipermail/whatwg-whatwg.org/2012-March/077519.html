</I>

Why would anyone want to turn off smoothing for just drawImage and not
repeat patterns?  Our games use repeat patterns to draw tiled textures as a
quicker way to render a grid of drawImage, so why not make them work the
same?  If I wasn't clear, in the quoted post I thought the
fact mozImageSmoothingEnabled did not affect repeat patterns was a bug.
 IMO the smoothing property should affect everything (perhaps even the
aliased lines request that was brought up).  Things like a retro
pixel-style game will want a simple option to deliberately
alias/nearest-neighbour everything on the canvas, and having the smoothing
option affect some things but not others seems to just be an inconvenience.

BTW:
- have you got a link to the spec including the smoothing property? can't
seem to find it
- don't get me wrong, this is great work, I'm just throwing in my thoughts
on the changes!
