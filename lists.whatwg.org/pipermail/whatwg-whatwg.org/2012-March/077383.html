It seems unlikely to me that adding support for an encoding here will
make it harder to eradicate the encoding from the web.

</I>
Why are encodings different than other parts of the API where you
indeed have to know what works and what doesn't.

&gt;<i> It also means that browsers need to be able to encode to each of these
</I>&gt;<i> encodings, and encoding for all of them needs to be specified, which I think
</I>&gt;<i> is currently unneeded.&#160; (Unless we go the asymmetric encoding/decoding
</I>&gt;<i> route, supporting only decoders for legacy charsets.&#160; If this is the only
</I>&gt;<i> reason that'd all have to be specified, that's probably another reason to
</I>&gt;<i> consider it...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supporting streaming decoding for modal encodings, such as ISO-2022-CN,
</I>&gt;<i> might also be a burden: it means implementations would be required to
</I>&gt;<i> support stateful, incremental decoding for that charset, which is more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated than most encodings (which are stateless).&#160; Many implementations
</I>&gt;<i> probably do support that, but I don't think it's currently mandatory, and it
</I>&gt;<i> would complicate any streaming API.&#160; Stateful encodings need to die even
</I>&gt;<i> more than other legacy encodings; I hope this API doesn't have to support
</I>&gt;<i> any of them.
</I>
UTF8 is stateful, so I disagree.
