stringLength doesn't return the length of the decoded string.  It returns
the byte offset of the first \0 (or the length of the whole buffer, if
none), for decoding null-terminated strings.  For multibyte encodings (eg.
everything except UTF-16 and friends), it's just memchr(), so it's much
faster than actually decoding the string.

Currently the use-case of simply wanting to convert a string to a
&gt;<i> binary buffer is a bit cumbersome. You first have to call the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;encodedLength&quot; function, then allocate a buffer of the right size,
</I>&gt;<i> then call the &quot;encode&quot; function.
</I>

I suggested eg.

result = encode(&quot;string&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;, null).output;

which would create an ArrayBuffer of the required size.  Presumably the
null ArrayBufferView argument would be optional, so you could just say
encode(&quot;string&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;).

It doesn't seem possible to implement the 'encode' function without
&gt;<i> doing multiple scans over the string. The implementation seems
</I>&gt;<i> required both to check that the data can be decoded using the
</I>&gt;<i> specified encoding, as well as check that the data will fit in the
</I>&gt;<i> passed in buffer. Only then can the implementation start decoding the
</I>&gt;<i> data. This seems problematic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Only if it guarantees that it doesn't write anything to the output buffer
unless the entire result will fit.  I don't think we need to do that; just
guarantee that it'll be truncated on a whole codepoint.

I also don't think it's a good idea to throw an exception for encoding
&gt;<i> errors. Better to convert characters to the unicode replacement
</I>&gt;<i> character. I believe we made a similar change to the WebSockets
</I>&gt;<i> specification recently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Was that change made?  I filed
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16157,">https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=16157,</A> but it still seems to
be undecided.
