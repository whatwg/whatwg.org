Firefox 12 whines to the error console when submitting a form using an
encoding that cannot represent all Unicode. Hopefully, after Firefox
12 has been released, this will help Web authors to actually test
their sites with the error console open locate forms that can corrupt
user input.

I still think that allowing ASCII-only pages to omit the encoding
declaration is the wrong call. I agree with Simon's point about the
doctype and reliance on quirks.

Firefox Nightly (14 if all goes well) whines to the error console when
the encoding hasn't been declared and about a bunch of other encoding
declaration-related bad conditions. It also warns about ASCII-only
pages, because I didn't want to burn cycles detecting whether a page
is ASCII-only and because I think it's the wrong call not to whine
about ASCII-only templates that might getting non-ASCII content later.
However, I suppressed the message about the lack of an encoding
declaration for different-origin frames, because it is so common for
ad iframes that contain only images or flash objects to lack an
encoding declaration that not suppressing the message would have made
the error console too noisy. It's cheaper to detect whether the
message is about to be emitted for a different-origin frame than to
detect whether it's about to be emitted for an ASCII-only page.
Besides, authors generally are powerless to fix the technical flaws of
different-origin embeds.

&gt;<i> Currently, &quot;iso-10646-ucs-2&quot; is neither an alias for UTF-16 nor an

That's not reality in Gecko.

</I>
Evidently, it's too vague, because I read the spec and implemented
something different from what you meant.
