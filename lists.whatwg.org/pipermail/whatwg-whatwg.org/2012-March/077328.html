<PRE>Using Views instead of specifying the offset and length sounds good.

Other Unicode encodings may be useful, to decode existing file formats
containing (most likely at a minimum) UTF-16.  I don't feel strongly about
that, though; we're stuck with UTF-16 as an internal representation in the
platform, but that doesn't necessarily mean we need to support it as a
transfer encoding.

For non-Unicode legacy encodings, I think that even if use cases exist,
they should be given more than the usual amount of scrutiny before being
supported.

Supporting throwing is okay if it's really wanted, but the default should
be replacement.  It reduces fatal errors to (usually) non-fatal
replacement, for obscure cases that people generally don't test.  It's a
much more sane default failure mode.

As another option, never throw, but allow returning the number of
conversion errors:

results = encode(&quot;abc\uD800def&quot;, outputView, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);

where results.inputConsumed is the number of words consumed in myString,
results.outputWritten is the number of UTF-8 bytes written, and
results.errors is 1.

That also allows block-by-block conversion; for example, to convert as many
complete characters as possible into a fixed-size buffer for transmission,
then starting again at the next unencoded character.

One more idea, while I'm brainstorming: if outputView is null, allocate an
ArrayBuffer of the necessary size, storing it in results.output.  That
eliminates the need for a separate length pass, without bloating the API
with another overload.

(Count me in on that, too.  Heuristics bad.)

 Ignoring the issue of invalid code points, the length calculations for
&gt;<i> non-UTF-8 encodings are trivial. (And with the suggestion that UTF-16 not
</I>&gt;<i> be sanitized, that case is trivially 2x the JS string length.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
UTF-16 &quot;sanitization&quot; (replacing mismatched surrogates with U+FFFD) doesn't
change the size of the output, actually.
