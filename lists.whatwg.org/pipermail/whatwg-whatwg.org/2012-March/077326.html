</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the direction I prefer. String encoding and decoding seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to be a complex enough problem that it should be expressed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; separately from the typed array spec itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some quick feedback:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - [OmitConstructor] doesn't seem to be WebIDL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Historically, the spec started off as an addition to the Typed Array spec
that splintered off; cleanup is definitely needed, thanks.


&gt;<i>  - please don't allow UAs to implement other encodings. You should list
</I>&gt;<i>   the exact set of supported encodings and the exact labels that should
</I>&gt;<i>   be recognised as meaning those encodings, and disallow all others.
</I>&gt;<i>   Otherwise, we'll be in a never-ending game of reverse-engineering each
</I>&gt;<i>   others' lists of supported encodings and it'll keep growing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - What's the use case for supporting anything but UTF-8?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For both of the above: initially suggested use cases included parsing data
as esoteric as ID3 tags in MP3 files, where encoding unspecified and is
guessed at by decoders, and includes non-Unicode encodings. It was
suggested that the encoding sniffing capabilities of browsers be leveraged.
(Cue a strong &quot;nooooooo!&quot; from Anne.)

I completely agree that we should explicitly list the set of encoding
supported and should remove the &quot;other encodings&quot; allowance.

Whether we should restrict it as far as UTF-8 depends on whether we
envision this API only used for parsing/serializing newly defined data
formats, or whether there is consideration for interop with previously
existing formats data formats and code. For example, &quot;BINARY&quot; would be used
to bridge the existing atob()/btoa() methods with Typed Arrays (although
base64 directly in/out of Typed Arrays would be preferable).

Jonas, since you started this thread - did your content authors mention
encodings?


&gt;<i>  - Having a mechanism that lets you encode the string and get a length
</I>&gt;<i>   separate from the mechanism that lets you encode the string and get the
</I>&gt;<i>   encoded string seems like it would encourage very inefficient code. Can
</I>&gt;<i>   we instead have a mechanism that returns both at once? Or is the idea
</I>&gt;<i>   that for some encodings getting the encoded length is much quicker than
</I>&gt;<i>   getting the actual string?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The use case was to compute the size necessary to allocate a single buffer
into which may be encoded multiple strings and other data, rather than
allocating multiple small buffers and then copying strings into a larger
buffer.

Ignoring the issue of invalid code points, the length calculations for
non-UTF-8 encodings are trivial. (And with the suggestion that UTF-16 not
be sanitized, that case is trivially 2x the JS string length.)


&gt;<i>  - Seems weird that integers and strings would have such different APIs
</I>&gt;<i>   for doing the same thing. Why can't we handle them equivalently? As in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     len = view.setString(strings[i],
</I>&gt;<i>                          offset + Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT,
</I>&gt;<i>                          &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>     view.setUint32(offset, len);
</I>&gt;<i>     offset += Uint32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT + len;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Heh, that's where the discussion started, actually. We wanted to keep the
DataView interface simple, and potentially support encoding into plain JS
arrays and/or non-TypedArray support that appeared to be on the horizon for
JS.
