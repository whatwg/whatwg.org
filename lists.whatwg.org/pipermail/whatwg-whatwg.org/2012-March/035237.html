It would never be possible to drop the CPU side buffer data cache. A
subsequent draw call may set up the vertex attribute pointers
differently for the same buffer object, which would necessitate going
back through the buffer's data and generating new, appropriately
byte-swapped data for the GPU.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that seems to be the only way to support universal webgl content on big-endian UAs. It's not great due to the memory overhead, but at least it shouldn't incur a significant performance overhead, and it typically only incurs a temporary memory overhead as we should be able to drop the buffer data caches quickly in most cases. Also, buffers are typically 10x smaller than textures, so the memory overhead would typically be ~ 10% in corner cases where we couldn't drop the caches.
</I>
Our emails certainly crossed, but please refer to my other email.
WebGL applications that assemble vertex data for the GPU using typed
arrays will already work correctly on big-endian architectures. This
was a key consideration when these APIs were being designed. The
problems occur when binary data is loaded via XHR and uploaded to
WebGL directly. DataView is supposed to be used in such cases to load
the binary data, because the endianness of the file format must
necessarily be known.

The possibility of forcing little-endian semantics was considered when
typed arrays were originally being designed. I don't have absolute
performance numbers to quote you, but based on previous experience
with Java's NIO Buffer classes, I am positive that the performance
impact for WebGL applications on big-endian architectures would be
very large. It would prevent applications which manipulate vertices in
JavaScript from running acceptably on big-endian machines.

&gt;<i> In conclusion: WebGL is not the worst here, there is a pretty reasonable avenue for big-endian UAs to implement it in a way that allows running the same unmodified content as little-endian UAs.
