</I>&gt;<i> an &lt;a rel=&quot;parent&quot;/&quot;up&quot;&gt; with the same href value, or failing that, 
</I>&gt;<i> which contained a &lt;link rel=&quot;home&quot;/&quot;front&quot;/&quot;top&quot;&gt; or an &lt;a 
</I>&gt;<i> rel=&quot;home&quot;/&quot;front&quot;/&quot;top&quot;&gt; with the same href value, or failing that, 
</I>&gt;<i> which had the same host), a form control on that page with the same 
</I>&gt;<i> id/name would retain the same shortcut.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (A minor benefit of this approach is that shortcuts you set yourself are 
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to be remembered than accesskeys set by an author.)
</I>
Yeah, that makes sense. So we're saying access keys should be completed 
deprecated in HTML?


&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that, well, people want keyboard access shortcuts. This was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mentioned in another thread; Pine, for instance, has very fast key-based UI,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and it would suck if there was no way to do something as quick in HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is suckiness, WF2's repetition model -- or any repetition model, 
</I>&gt;<i> come to that -- is irretrievably sucky: you can't expect every row to 
</I>&gt;<i> have unique accesskeys no matter how many rows are added. (Cf. 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49334#c65">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49334#c65</A>&gt;.)
</I>
Indeed not, but you could have keys for adding or removing rows.

People want to be able to do stuff with the keyboard, e.g. GMail wants to 
be able to implement Pine-like keys. Clearly, that won't work across all 
devices. Just as clearly, we can't rely on users to set up all these 
keybindings themselves. Unfortunately I just don't see any other way to do 
it which would not have flaws.

Maybe this is one case where we just want a half-assed solution?
