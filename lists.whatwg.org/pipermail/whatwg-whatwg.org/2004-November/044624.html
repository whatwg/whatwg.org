</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the past 15 years of semantic markup have shown these three

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Most authors Just Don't Care about semantic markup.
</I>
This is true.

&gt;<i> They'll only use
</I>&gt;<i>     it if it's the easiest way of getting the visual effect or behavior
</I>&gt;<i>     they want in their own favorite browser, or if they can use it to
</I>&gt;<i>     game search engines. (That's why authors use &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;, for
</I>&gt;<i>     example, but not &lt;address&gt;.) 
</I>
This isn't really true, in general. For example, many sites fail to use 
headings (and use odd combinations of &lt;font&gt; and &lt;b&gt; and &lt;big&gt; to get 
the same effect) even though headings are the easiest way to get 
something that looks kindof like a heading. In fact, unwanted styling on 
elements has an adverse effect on their use (e.g. I have heard people 
say &quot;h1 shouldn't be used because the font is too big&quot;).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Those authors who do care about semantic markup often do so
</I>&gt;<i>     overzealously, using it even when it's not appropriate. For example,
</I>&gt;<i>     they use &lt;em&gt; whenever they want italics or &lt;strong&gt; whenever they
</I>&gt;<i>     want bold.
</I>
This is true. However it only applies when there is a 1:1 mapping 
between a 'visual' and a 'semantic' element. The net effect is that, 
from the point of view of UAs non-semantic elements are treated like the 
sematic ones (lynx renders both &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt; in purple despite the fact 
that purple != italic).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  The more complex a markup language, the fewer people understand it,
</I>&gt;<i>     the less conformant the average article will be, so the less useful
</I>&gt;<i>     the Web's semantics will be. Current HTML authors may clamour for
</I>&gt;<i>     new features, but they have forgotten what it was like to be a new
</I>&gt;<i>     HTML author; and new authors are neither subscribed to this list nor
</I>&gt;<i>     employed by browser vendors, so it is easy to forget about them. 
</I>
This is sort of true although tutorials tend to focus on the common 
elements &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;br&gt; etc.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if &lt;section&gt;, &lt;navigation&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;sidebar&gt; are introduced, with the default presentation currently 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested {display: block; margin: 0;}, I predict the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *   A greater number of Web developers will never use most of these
</I>&gt;<i>     elements, but they will replace all occurrences of &lt;div&gt; on their
</I>&gt;<i>     pages with &lt;section&gt; because it's more &quot;semantic&quot; (just like they
</I>&gt;<i>     did with &lt;em&gt; for &lt;i&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; for &lt;b&gt;), and they will feel good
</I>&gt;<i>     about it. 
</I>
This could be a problem. In principle, the 'visual difference' should be 
the link between &lt;section&gt; and headings. That might not be enough. Did I 
already suggest an official authoring guide for the spec that would 
explain the difference between &lt;div&gt; and &lt;section&gt; (and other such 
issues) in a more approachable way than the spec itself can? If not, it 
seems like a good idea.

&gt;<i> *   The vast majority of article producers (Weblogs and online
</I>&gt;<i>     newspapers) will never use &lt;article&gt;, because there's no visual or
</I>&gt;<i>     behavioral benefit from doing so. So &lt;article&gt; will never become a
</I>&gt;<i>     reliable way of dissecting or aggregating pages. 
</I>
Again, I think this could be a problem.

&gt;<i> *   The number of knowledgable HTML authors, the proportion of HTML
</I>&gt;<i>     pages that are valid, and therefore the overall usefulness of the
</I>&gt;<i>     Web, will be less than it otherwise would have been because of
</I>&gt;<i>     HTML's increased complexity. 
</I>
I tend to disagree here. It's not like there are hundreds of pages using 
&lt;cite&gt; where they want &lt;i&gt;. A few features will be abused and so won't 
be useful. The remainer will be infrequently used but usually used 
correctly.

&gt;<i> One way of improving this situation would be to reduce the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> new elements -- forget about &lt;article&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another way would be to recommend more distinct default presentation 
</I>&gt;<i> for each of the elements -- for example, default &lt;article&gt; to having a 
</I>&gt;<i> drop cap, 
</I>
Hmm

&gt;<i> default &lt;sidebar&gt; to floating right
</I>
+1

&gt;<i> , default &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;navigation&gt; to having a slightly 
</I>&gt;<i> darker background than their parent element
</I>
It seems like there should be something more obvious that could be done 
for these elements. For &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; a border below and above, 
respectivly, would seem obvious.

&gt;<i> , and default &lt;header&gt;...&lt;li&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;...&lt;/li&gt; to inline 
</I>&gt;<i> presentation. This would make authors more likely to choose the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate element. 
</I>
An interesting side effect might be users who didn't understand enough 
CSS to turn these effects off eschewing the new elements entirely. Which 
might be a good thing. Or might not.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A complementary long-term approach would be to deprecate the most 
</I>&gt;<i> redundant and/or least effectual elements and attributes from HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> 4.01 -- for example, &lt;acronym&gt;, &lt;big&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;var&gt;, 
</I>&gt;<i> accesskey=, cite=, longdesc=, and name= -- in preparation for removing 
</I>&gt;<i> them. This would eventually help reduce the complexity of the spec.
</I>
+1 in principle, but I'd argue a little with the list of things to 
deprecate :)
