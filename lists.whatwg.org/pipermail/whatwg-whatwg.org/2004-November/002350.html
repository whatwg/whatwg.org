</I>&gt;<i>3. User Agents provide the ability for a power user to accept those keys or

</I>&gt;<i>preference -- some users may choose different keystrokes based on their
</I>&gt;<i>dominant hand, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What's the difference between that and the current situation? As far as 
I can tell you've effectively recreated accesskey except:
a) The keybindings are suggestions rather than absolutes (a trivial 
change to the existing semantics of accesskey)
b) You've invoked a seperate file for UAs to load and parse to get 
accesskey information
c) You've lost backward compatibility

I still haven't seen any eveidence that the problems with accesskey are 
more than just over-specific language in the html 4 spec. Unless there 
is a major problem I haven't noticed, /all/ the WebApps spec needs to do 
is to state that
a) The author provided keybindings are suggestions, not absolutes (I 
feel a UA should ignore accesskey entirely if the UA authors believe 
this serves the needs of the user-base better)
b) The UA should act in such a way as to avoid key conflicts

Specifying that UAs _must_ allow per-site keybindings and so on is going 
into the realm of specifying UA design. The spec should constrain UA 
authors less  - so they can develop solutions that meet the needs of 
their users - not more. In fact, I think my earlier examples were a 
little strongly worded (using _should_ where &quot;may wish to&quot; would be 
better). The only _should_'s I would have are _should_ provide a 
mechanism to avoid key conflicts (e.g. by reassigning author-specified 
accesskeys to unused combinations) and _should_ provide information 
about the accesskeys defined on the current page.
