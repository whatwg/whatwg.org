That could have been implemented much better with Javascript, which
wouldn't require you to press ALT with the keys.

Do you think it is different for access keys? They are even more
useless. Most people have no clue about the existence of access keys,
and when you do you still have to depend on the page's author to both
have 1. implemented them, and 2. indicated which keys to use.


&gt;<i> I don't think that author could provide any meaningful suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> All the standard access keys should already have key binding and for

</I>&gt;<i> points, for example.
</I>
I agree.

Though suggestions would perhaps make it easier for the user to pick a 
choice, instead of having to make one up himself (imagine, having to 
think for yourself ;p)... I'm unsure. However, the additional markup 
involved seems a little troublesome (though a list of space-separated 
values would seem ok). In any case, the access key should be suggestive, 
nothing more.
