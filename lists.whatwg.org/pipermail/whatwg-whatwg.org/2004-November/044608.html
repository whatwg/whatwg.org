Bonus points if it wasn't shareware. Triple bonus points if it was

A tree control  
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-July/</A> 
000856.html&gt;. Yes, it would be larger than an option menu, but I  
suspect authors using &lt;optgroup&gt; are more interested in the ability to  
make single rather than multiple selections than they are in the size  
of the control.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4.  Does it make sense to have both an &lt;input type=button/submit/
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reset... and &lt;button type=... element.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They're semantically different. The former does something that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually will open a new page (and/or open or close a window); for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example, &quot;OK&quot;, or &quot;Insert Addresses...&quot;, or &quot;Don't Save&quot;. The latter  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does something that usually won't open a new page (and/or open or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> close a window); for example, &quot;Add Row&quot;, or &quot;Remove Row&quot;, or &quot;Play&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually they're semantically identical. The only difference is that
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;button&gt; can have element content, and &lt;input&gt; can't.
</I>
Actually, buttons with rounded ends and buttons with rectangular ends  
have had the semantic meanings I described above since Mac OS 8.0  
(albeit that those meanings were not explicitly stated in the HIGs).  
When &lt;button&gt; was introduced into HTML, UAs rendered it with  
rectangular ends, while retaining rounded ends for &lt;input  
type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;. (This distinction was originally not apparent on  
Windows, but it has become apparent since Windows XP.) This was  
consistent with the native meanings because &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;  
almost always opens a new page (and sometimes opens/closes a window),  
whereas &lt;button&gt; is usually used for scripts to alter the content/state  
of items within a page.

It is true that the semantics are currently happening by accident, and  
they can be flouted if authors try hard enough, but they do exist. They  
may not be worth keeping; conversely, they may be worth specializing  
even further. (For example, Mac OS X introduces completely circular  
buttons, primarily used for controlling playback of a media track.)

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Csaba's point is well-made, actually. I don't think anything in his  
</I>&gt;<i> list warrants deprecation at this point, but it is definitely  
</I>&gt;<i> important for us not to introduce too much redundant stuff. People  
</I>&gt;<i> should not feel at all worried about suggesting that we're adding too  
</I>&gt;<i> much.
</I>
Adding a little in each revision will eventually have the same effect  
as adding too much in a single version; the spec will become too  
complex for people to bother reading, so authors will copy-and-paste  
erroneous/inappropriate code from nearby pages instead of referring to  
the spec. (For example: &quot;You can search for DOCTYPEs all day at w3.org  
without finding one page that lists them all. And when you do hunt down  
a DOCTYPE (generally in relation to a particular Recommendation or  
Working Draft), it's often one that won't work on your site.&quot;  
&lt;<A HREF="http://alistapart.com/articles/doctype/">http://alistapart.com/articles/doctype/</A>&gt;)

So when making your list of new block elements for HTML 5, for example,  
ideally you should have a comparable list of elements and attributes  
that are to be removed.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because that would be bizarre behavior for those people accustomed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the behavior of native option menus, i.e. most people who have used a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer. (And yes, I think unspecified radiogroups should default to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selecting the first, too, but apparently that wouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backward-compatible.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the spec is merely describing what UAs do. UAs have tried to do
</I>&gt;<i> other things, but they always fall back on that behaviour because sites
</I>&gt;<i> actually depend on it now.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
I noticed a couple of days ago that &quot;ISO-HTML requires that at all  
times one and only one of the radio buttons in a set be checked.  
Initially, if none of the &lt;INPUT&gt; elements in a set of radio buttons  
specifies CHECKED, then the user agent shall mark the first radio  
button of the set as checked&quot;  
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/15445/UG.HTML#I.RADIO">http://www.cs.tcd.ie/15445/UG.HTML#I.RADIO</A>&gt;. Ah well.
