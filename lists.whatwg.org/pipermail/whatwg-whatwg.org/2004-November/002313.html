<PRE>
One set of the ideas that was brought up in this forum was the ability to 
extend &lt;textarea&gt; to support syntax highlighting, or WYSIWYG editing of 
BB code markup, or just the ability to do rich text editing of any kind.

Having considered all the suggestions, the only thing I could really see 
as being realistic would be to do something similar to (and ideally 
compatible with) IE's &quot;contentEditable&quot; and &quot;designMode&quot; attributes.

I've added a placeholder section to Web Apps for now (7. Editing). I'll be 
filling it in due course. If anyone has any comments related to IE's 
contentEditable/designMode feature (problems with it, quirks, undocumented 
features, etc), please let me know.

Realistically, I just can't see something of this scoped getting 
implemented and shipped in the default install of browsers.

Once you're talking about Schema-based validation prior to submission, I 
think you're into XForms territory, really. If browsers implement it, you 
could use DOM3 Validation to do it from script, too.

The problem with this is I imagine UAs would probably just end up doing 
nothing, and we'd be back to where we are now.

Exactly.

I think the fact that there is already content that uses these features is 
probably the strongest argument towards WHATWG just reusing them.
