It means you won't see a company name in the list of members, only 
people's names.

For what it's worth, I actually did request an urgent reply, several 
times. I don't think it had much effect. :-)


&gt;<i> Me, I don't want permission to do anything right now, I just wanted

</I>&gt;<i> more trustworty than a company that could be bought at any time.

Hopefully the updated notice resolves your concerns.

Cheers,
