Yeah, I'm not sure what a good solution is either.


&gt;<i> &gt; You're assuming that we give the pages a way to tell if they are

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> how exactly do you propose to do that, there's going to be all sorts of 
</I>&gt;<i> ways of inferring that they are (checking computed CSS properties, 
</I>&gt;<i> try/catching script that would only be permissiong in the native 
</I>&gt;<i> application etc.)  If you could genuinely prevent them from knowing, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think you'd have to seriously hobble CSS Object Model etc.
</I>
I can't see that the stylesheets would be any different, and I don't see 
why the permissions would be different either. The only real difference is 
whether the browser's own chrome is around the window or not.
