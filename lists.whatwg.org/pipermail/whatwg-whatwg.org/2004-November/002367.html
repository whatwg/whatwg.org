</I>&gt;<i> I've encountered two situations where setting or retrieving the caret

</I>&gt;<i> apply an input mask to a text box.  For example, I'd like the ability to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a text box where the date delimiters (dashes or slashes) appear 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically in a text box upon entering the field, and when the user 
</I>&gt;<i> types in the field, it fills into the appropriate spaces in the input 
</I>&gt;<i> box and sets the text selection to the next appropriate position, all 
</I>&gt;<i> while allowing the user to reposition the cursor within the text box 
</I>&gt;<i> with a keyboard or mouse without being able to edit or delete the 
</I>&gt;<i> delimiters (dashes or slashes).  This would be very similar to input 
</I>&gt;<i> mask features in certain native apps that I've used.
</I>
Indeed, that would definitely need APIs for setting and retrieving the 
caret position. I've noted this use case and will be sure to address it 
when I work on the caret stuff.


&gt;<i> The second situation is an application that would like to highlight text 
</I>&gt;<i> in a text box or textarea for the purposes of a spell check, thesaurus, 
</I>&gt;<i> or search-and-replace operation.
</I>
In this case you want more of a highlighting API than a selecting API, 
though, right?


&gt;<i> &gt; So I don't know. What do people think? Should we try to be backards 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compatible with the Mozilla interface or the IE interface, or should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we start from scratch here, and require that people write wrappers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around the Moz and IE wrappers if they want compatibility? If we use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something already defined, what do we use? What are the use cases that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matter?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the IE and Mozilla models are a bit complicated, and it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> relatively easy to create a wrapper for various UAs.
</I>
The advantage with being compatible is that old content Just Works.


&gt;<i> Here's what I propose:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given a text box or textarea that I'll refer to as &quot;tx&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tx.selectionStart: This is a read/write integer that would set or retrieve 
</I>&gt;<i>    the starting index of the selected text (one-based, so &quot;1&quot; would be 
</I>&gt;<i>    the first character in the string).  If nothing is selected, 0 would
</I>&gt;<i>    be returned.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tx.selectionEnd: This is a read/write integer that would set or retrieve
</I>&gt;<i>    the ending index of the selected text (one-based).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tx.position: This is a read/write integer that would set or retrieve
</I>&gt;<i>    the position of the caret (again, one-based).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given these three very simple ways to access the position of the caret and
</I>&gt;<i> text selection, other derivatives available in IE's implementation
</I>&gt;<i> (inputrange.text.length, for example) would be trivial to compute
</I>&gt;<i> (tx.selectionEnd-tx.selectionStart).  Given that the selectionStart and
</I>&gt;<i> selectionEnd return 0 if nothing is selected, this would work properly in
</I>&gt;<i> the case of length computations.  Additionally, it would be easy to
</I>&gt;<i> extract the text, given functions such as substring().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would cover everything I've wished for with cursor positioning 
</I>&gt;<i> within a text box or textarea and would be vastly simpler than what 
</I>&gt;<i> currently exists.  What do others think - is this comprehensive? Is this a 
</I>&gt;<i> viable solution?
</I>
That certainly seems simpler; I've noted it (which means it's now in the 
comment block at the bottom of the web apps spec) and will definitely 
consider it in more detail in due course.
