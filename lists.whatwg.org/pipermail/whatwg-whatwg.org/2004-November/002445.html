<PRE>Internet Explorer has the proprietary CSS property accelerator to indicate a accesskey [1].  However, I do realise that this isn't
the same as what you are looking for.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; UA vendors have had over six years to come up with non-awkward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; support for accesskey=.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't understand. What makes you think that vendors would implement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the complex code/UI needed to enble custom, per-site accesskeys when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you note that they've already failed to implement simple enhancements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that would make the current accesskey scheme more user friendly?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good question. History has shown that UA vendors find it much easier
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to implement UI features (tabbed windows, download managers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; customizable toolbars, etc) than to implement layout engine features
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (full HTML4 support, full CSS2 support, a &quot;Fit to Window&quot; function,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; smart table header scrolling, etc). (This is probably also why there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are many more graphical UAs today than there are layout engines.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is probably because UI features sell the product in ways that
</I>&gt;<i> support for anything beyond basic layout features do not. Accesibility
</I>&gt;<i> features, sadly, don't have the kind of mas-market appeal needed to make
</I>&gt;<i> implementing complex enhancements a priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, implementing accesskey underlining would require a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layout engine feature -- a :-foobrowser-accesskey pseudo-class, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could then be selected for underlining -- which is apparently why UA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vendors haven't bothered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are other ways of alerting the user to the presence of acceskeys.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed the solution you propose would not, in general, work because
</I>&gt;<i> accesskeys can be placed on elements where underlining is not a
</I>&gt;<i> possibility (form fields, images, etc.) or where the author style of the
</I>&gt;<i> element is underlined (e.g. many links). A better approach would be to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a list of accesskeys and a visual indication of the function of
</I>&gt;<i> each (e.g. placing a temporary border on the element in question)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Implementing the automatic shortcut key creation scheme I described
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above, however, would require only CSS2 generated content (to display
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the shortcut in the document), and that is already supported in all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; major layout engines except for Trident.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would also involve breaking page layouts which is a big no-no. It
</I>&gt;<i> would also involve the browser having a good idea of which key
</I>&gt;<i> combinations are avaliable which, in Mozilla (or Firefox) at least, is
</I>&gt;<i> almost impossible at present (one could, I suppose, implement some
</I>&gt;<i> system so that addons could register the shortcuts they used). Indeed,
</I>&gt;<i> it's hard to imagine that any browser can be certian that some other
</I>&gt;<i> desktop level application (a window manager, for example), is not using
</I>&gt;<i> a particular combination. So the 'solution' wouldn't solve the problem;
</I>&gt;<i> it would still be possible for conflicts to occur (and UI for sorting
</I>&gt;<i> out such conflicts has not yet been developed and shows no sign of being
</I>&gt;<i> developed). Moreover, if one did develop such UI, it would presumably
</I>&gt;<i> work per-page rather than per site (since there is no good way of
</I>&gt;<i> defining a site). This would lead to inconsistent user-experience since
</I>&gt;<i> accesskeys that worked on one page would not on another on the same
</I>&gt;<i> site. Automatically defining accesskeys would only make this last issue
</I>&gt;<i> worse since the keys could not even be expected to exist on the second page.
</I>&gt;<i>
