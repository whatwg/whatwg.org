The browser could sidestep this problem by displaying an upload 
complete message. Applications which spend a great deal of time 
processing in this way should notify the user in advance, again so they 
do not give up before a response is sent.

</I>
Using a frames to submit in the background is a solution which tries to 
work around browser deficiencies. My understanding is that this working 
group is about developing &quot;ideal&quot; solutions from the ground up. Though 
I may have misunderstood WHAT WG's intentions.

&gt;<i> Popups annoy users.

Sorry, popup was the wrong word, I meant dialog.

These are valid complaints, but you've missed the broader point. 
Uploads take time, whether you hide it using a frame or not, and users 
need feedback during this period, ideally giving an ETA or similar 
updating metric. If not, a user will often assume that the application 
is broken and go away after as little as 10 seconds.
