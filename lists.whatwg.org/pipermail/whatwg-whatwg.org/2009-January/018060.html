</I>
With RDFa, most of the parsing is done by HTML. So I would call it an 
&quot;RDFa processor&quot;. And yes, that doesn't change the fact that code needs 
to be written. But it affects the type of the code that needs to be written.

&gt;<i> ...

</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Well, there are lots of conditionals in this statement :-)

&gt;<i> We have to ensure that the problem isn't already solved by the
</I>&gt;<i> language first, and only after that can we evaluate whether the
</I>&gt;<i> language is the correct place to solve the problem, and only after
</I>&gt;<i> *that* can we start discussing how to actually go about solving the
</I>&gt;<i> problem in the language.  Too much of this discussion is jumping
</I>&gt;<i> straight to step 3, so Ian, I, and others are trying to focus it on
</I>&gt;<i> step 1.
</I>
I would say this is because the research and design in this area totally 
predates HTML5. Are you seriously suggesting that all of that needs to 
start from scratch?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not quite correct.  Again, the problem of embedded shareable data in a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> web page has been solved multiple times.  The specific problem of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sharing *RDF* data (due to needing/wanting the specific benefits RDF
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can offer) has also been solved.  What are the precise problems that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> require *RDFa* as a solution?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you elaborate a bit on these solutions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Microformats, embedded data in &lt;script&gt; blocks, embedded XML, custom
</I>&gt;<i> attributes, other miscellaneous uses of @class and related attributes,
</I>&gt;<i> and simply putting the data in natural language.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
- Microformats: how do they solve sharing RDF data?

- embedded data in &lt;script&gt;: see discussion above

- embedded XML: embedded in where?

- custom attributes: wow, that sounds like RDFa

- @class and friends: that sounds like eRDF, which the way it is 
currently specified is broken in HTML5 (@profile)

- natural language: hey great, please elaborate :-)

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My understanding was that RDFa has been produced in order to address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems with other approaches, such as using &lt;meta&gt; elements, eRDF, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microformats.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there is a *successful* alternative to RDFa that does not require new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attributes, please let us know :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most successful alternative is nothing at all.  ^_^  We can
</I>&gt;<i> extract copious data from web pages reliably without metadata, either
</I>&gt;<i> using our human senses (in personal use) or natural-language-based
</I>&gt;<i> processing (in search engine use).  It has not yet been established
</I>&gt;<i> that sufficient and significant enough problems *exist* to justify a
</I>&gt;<i> solution, let alone one that requires an addition to html.  That is
</I>&gt;<i> what Ian is specifically looking for.
</I>
That's what you and Ian claim. Many disagree.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, you really do need to justify metadata anew; you can't
</I>&gt;<i> just point at Microformats or something similar and say &quot;we're doing
</I>&gt;<i> the same things as those guys!&quot;.  They exist currently because they
</I>&gt;<i> can fit their solutions into the language as it is; there is no
</I>&gt;<i> further need to justify them in this group.  Modifying the language,
</I>&gt;<i> though, is an explicit admission that this is a problem worth solving
</I>&gt;<i> and worth solving in a particular way, and so requires significant
</I>&gt;<i> justification.
</I>
Disagreed.

The very existence of Microformats prove that people want to augment 
their content with metadata that is machine-readable. Some of the 
shortcomings of Microformats are caused by the way they are retrofitted 
into HTML. So it's totally natural to discuss whether a better solution 
can be reached by adding new stuff to the language.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reminder: RDFa is one of the things the (W3C) Working Group's Charter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mentions as candidate for inclusion (either by a generic extensibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism, or otherwise by extending the language):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The HTML WG is encouraged to provide a mechanism to permit independently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developed vocabularies such as Internationalization Tag Set (ITS), Ruby, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RDFa to be mixed into HTML documents.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter.html#other">http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter.html#other</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a note, this isn't the W3C's HTML WG.  The WHATWG is independent
</I>&gt;<i> from the W3C.
</I> &gt; ...

Sounds like we need to restart the thread on the HTML WG's mailing list 
then.

Best regards, Julian
