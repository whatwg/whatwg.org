You ask us to take you seriously and consider your feedback, it would be  
nice if you took what e.g. Henri wrote seriously as well. Integrating a  
new feature in HTML is not a simple task, even if the new feature loads  
and renders fine in Internet Explorer.


&gt;<i> However, the debate ended as soon as Ian re-asserted his authority.
</I>
Ian just gave an indication of when he's going to work on this again. That  
doesn't mean that research into e.g. DOM consistency can't happen  
meanwhile. It also doesn't mean that debate needs to stop.
