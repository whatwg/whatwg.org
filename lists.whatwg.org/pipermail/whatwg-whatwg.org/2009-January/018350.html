Agreed. (The above is what Opera did in my testing at the time. I haven't 
checked to see if this has changed in recent builds.)


&gt;<i> &gt; - In one browser, the method call fails, saying that methods can't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   called while the document that defined them isn't the active document
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   of the browsing context whose global object is the method's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think adding checks for this condition at every JS-to-JS call boundary 
</I>&gt;<i> would be an unacceptable performance cost. This is a highly optimized 
</I>&gt;<i> code path in modern JITting implementations of JavaScript and I would be 
</I>&gt;<i> against slowing it down with extra checks just because the resulting 
</I>&gt;<i> behavior seems simple.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Should the check also occur at native-to-JS or JS-to-native boundaries? 
</I>&gt;<i> That would lead to outright broken behavior as event listeners in 
</I>&gt;<i> inactive documents wouldn't fire even when events occur that should 
</I>&gt;<i> trigger them, and getElementById on inactive documents wouldn't work. It 
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't clear to me if you had either of those cases in mind.)

Thanks for the feedback, this is very useful.

(The above model is IE's model.)


&gt;<i> &gt; - In one browser, the Window object acts as a kind of view on the global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   object, which changes with each navigation, leading the method to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the original global object in its scope chain, but the new one if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   uses the 'window' object. (In this environment, 'this' at the top scope
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   returns the 'window' object, not the global object.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This roughly describes the implementation internals of both Gecko-based 
</I>&gt;<i> and WebKit-based browsers with the latest version of the respective 
</I>&gt;<i> engines -- the so-called &quot;split window&quot; design. Modulo some of the 
</I>&gt;<i> details about the value of &quot;this&quot; (which could reasonably go either 
</I>&gt;<i> way), this would be the natural way for browsers adopting this design to 
</I>&gt;<i> behave, if they do not explicitly add additional checks.
</I>
I've now specced this, since it has better performance characteristics 
than the &quot;frozen scripts&quot; model I had previously specced. (It also has 
more interoperable implementations and one of the vendors who does not do 
this has indicated that they would like to move to such a model.)

I haven't mentioned the 'this' behavior, so right now |this !=== window|, 
which breaks the invariant that there is no way to actually get hold of a 
reference to the Window object itself (as opposed to the outer WindowProxy 
object that forwards to the inner Window object). This requirement would 
be a violation of ECMAScript 3.1, so if we could get that changed in 
ES3.1, that would be great. Failing that, it should probably be in the 
WebIDL JavaScript binding section.

Note: This is pretty hairy stuff, so I would appreciate close review of 
the recent checkin to make sure it matches reality.

Cheers,
