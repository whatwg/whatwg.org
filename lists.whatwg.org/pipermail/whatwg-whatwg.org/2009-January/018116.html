That's incorrect.

You can build a SearchMonkey infobar that is set to function on all URLs
(just use &quot;*&quot; in your URL field.)

For example, the Creative Commons SearchMonkey application:

<A HREF="http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=kVf.s">http://gallery.search.yahoo.com/application?smid=kVf.s</A>

(currently broken because of a recent change in the SearchMonkey PHP API
that we need to address, so here's a photo:

<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/2869419185/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/ysearchblog/2869419185/</A>
)

By adding the CC RDFa markup to your page, it will show up with the
infobar in Yahoo searches.

So site-specific microformats are clearly less powerful. And
vocabulary-specific microformats, while useful, are also not as useful
here (consider a SearchMonkey application that picks up CC-licensed
items, be they video, audio, books, scientific data, etc... Different
microformats = development hell.)

Have you read the RDFa Primer?
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/</A>

It describes (pre-SearchMonkey) the kind of applications that can be
built with RDFa. SearchMonkey is an ideal example, but it's by no means
the only one.
