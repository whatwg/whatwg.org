</I>Take you guys seriously...OK, yeah.

I don't doubt that the work will be challenging, or problematical. I'm 
not denying Henri's claim. And I didn't claim to be the one who would 
necessarily come up with the solutions, either, but that I would help in 
those instances that I could.

What I did express in the later emails, is what others have expressed 
who have asked about RDFa in HTML5: are we wasting our time even trying? 
That it seems like a decision has already been made, and we're spinning 
our wheels even attempting to find solutions. There's a difference 
between not being willing to negotiate, compromise, work the problem, 
and just spitting into the wind for no good.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the debate ended as soon as Ian re-asserted his authority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ian just gave an indication of when he's going to work on this again. 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't mean that research into e.g. DOM consistency can't happen 
</I>&gt;<i> meanwhile. It also doesn't mean that debate needs to stop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, Ian's listing of tasks pretty much precluded any input into the 
decision making process other than his own. I never see &quot;we&quot; when Ian 
writes, I only see &quot;I&quot;.

Regardless, perhaps Dan or Ben have better arguments than I do to input 
into the debate. I'm not helping.
