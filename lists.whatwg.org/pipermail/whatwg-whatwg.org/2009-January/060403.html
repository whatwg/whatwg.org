</I>&gt;<i> It should be noted in this case that RDFa also allows natural language

</I>&gt;<i> comment has been written by someone other than the page's main author, 
</I>&gt;<i> and thus not afford it the same level of trust granted to the rest of 
</I>&gt;<i> the page. So the natural language processing can benefit from RDFa.

That's true only if one can assume metadata are trustful, but they are 
only if they can be under a strict control, that is on a small-scale 
application. On a wider scale, one needs to make the opposite 
assumption, because it would or might be more common to find fake 
metadata with &quot;honest&quot; content (the prose of an advertisement does not 
lie, but related metadata can tell it's a different think to cheat a 
metadata-based UA), either because a site author can be a party to the 
spammer, or because authors can mess up metadata (yeah, they can mess up 
html code too, but that's either not a problem, because a UA can present 
the content as well, or it is but it might damage the author more than 
it may harm the user). If metadata are created/used for external 
consumption, they can be just ignored by authors, who instead may just 
copy&amp;paste code or reuse templates in different contexts, without being 
able to set proper metadata for the new content. Thus UAs can't rely on 
metadata /in general/, while they might /in some/, small-scale scenarios.

WBR, Alex
