And RDFa is also entirely under the control of the site author.

I thought your attack concerned both author markup and commenter markup.
But it seems we agree on author markup: no additional risk there.

So on to commenter markup.

Most blogging software already white-lists the HTML elements and
attributes they allow, otherwise they are easily hacked with XSS. This
means that, by default, most blogging software will strip RDFa from
comments, which is exactly the right approach, since comments should not
have authority over the structured data of the page.
