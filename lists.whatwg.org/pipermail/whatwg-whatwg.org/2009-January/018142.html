My understanding of the use-case, based on discussions so far, is:

- Allow authors to embed annotations in HTML documents such that RDF 
triples can be unambiguously extracted from human-readable data without 
duplicating the data, and thus ensuring that the machine-readable data 
and the human-readable data remain in sync.

The disconnect you're facing is that the proposers of RDFa consider the 
ability to encode RDF triples to be a goal, while you consider RDF 
triples to be a solution to a (as-yet-undetermined) higher-level 
problem. They take RDF as a given, while you do not. They have already 
solved some problems with RDF and wish only to adapt this generalized 
solution to work in HTML, while you wish to re-solve all of these 
problems from the ground up.

Would you agree with this analysis?

If this is accurate, then it's difficult to see how continued discussion 
on this topic can be productive.
