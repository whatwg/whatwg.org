Some languages are higher in the pecking order than others when  
software development is prioritized, and RDFa cannot level the playing  
field here.

Suppose there's a use case that can be satisfactorily addressed by  
applying NLP heuristics to content for the top-tier languages. Even if  
there were an RDF mechanism for addressing the same use case without  
relying on natural language, software aimed for serving the top-tier  
languages would still do the NLP thing for the use case. Thus, the  
development of the parallel RDF-based solution would be borne by the  
communities using the other languages. If the other languages can't  
get the users of the top-tier languages to use the same technical  
solution, they are still at a disadvantage even if an alternative  
technology stack is theoretically possible, because most software  
development effort goes into what makes sense for the top-tier  
languages without the results being applicable also for the other  
languages.

Instead of bearing the cost of developing a totally alternative  
technology stack for the other languages without benefiting from any  
spillover from the effort done for the top-tier languages, it makes  
more sense to invest the effort into building upon the reusable parts  
already developed for the top-tier languages.

(Quick case study about language-sensitive technology adoption and  
markets: When movable type was developed, a *subset* of the alphabet  
used for German--the native language of printing press suppliers--was  
adopted for Finnish. Today, hundreds of years later, digital font  
availability for Finnish is better than font availability for  
languages of comparable installed base that adopted *extensions* for  
the alphabet used for German or that used a totally different script.  
That is, NIH *still* hasn't caught up with the first-mover advantage  
as far as type goes.)
