Well, it'll require an N3 parser where previously none was needed. Also, 
it separates the metadata from the text, a situation most people want to 
avoid.

This may work, but as far as I can tell, the use of &lt;script&gt; for &quot;data 
blocks&quot; is an afterthought -- for instance, it's described in a section 
about, well, Scripting.

So, is anybody using this successfully in practice?

</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Could you elaborate a bit on these solutions?

My understanding was that RDFa has been produced in order to address 
problems with other approaches, such as using &lt;meta&gt; elements, eRDF, or 
microformats.

If there is a *successful* alternative to RDFa that does not require new 
attributes, please let us know :-).

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Well, there are many things that would offer more advantages than
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantages by themselves.  We can't possibly include all of them in
</I>&gt;<i> the spec; you can think about this as including a hidden large
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantage of 'will grow the size of the spec and the amount of work
</I>&gt;<i> implementors have to do'.  Thus the advantages must generally be
</I>&gt;<i> significantly larger than the disadvantages; this is why the best

</I>&gt;<i> already widespread hacks to accomplish this&quot;.  &lt;video&gt;, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> was included based on pretty much precisely that argument.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Reminder: RDFa is one of the things the (W3C) Working Group's Charter 
mentions as candidate for inclusion (either by a generic extensibility 
mechanism, or otherwise by extending the language):

&quot;The HTML WG is encouraged to provide a mechanism to permit 
independently developed vocabularies such as Internationalization Tag 
Set (ITS), Ruby, and RDFa to be mixed into HTML documents.&quot;

 &gt; ...
