</I>Ouch! Thanks Anne for the screenshot, otherwise I wouldn't have known
that it was my comment the one causing the issue.
My apologies Shelley for that incident. I assure you that it was not
intentional: it was a quite long post, I used some markup with the
intention of making it more readable (like italizing the quotes), and
by the end I messed things up. Thanks to the preview page I noticed
some issues, like that I had to escape the &quot;&lt;sarcasm&gt;...&lt;/sarcasm&gt;&quot;
for it to display (I'm too used to BBCode, which leaves unrecognized
markup &quot;as is&quot;), but I didn't catch the &lt;self-closed /&gt; one (nor the
preview page did: it showed up without issues).

</I>I don't really know how much did I mess up the markup on that post;
and I only managed to fix the issues that I spotted from the preview
page, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were more issues. Once more,
I would like to clarify that this was not intentional; but, given the
tension arising again from this debate, I can understand your
reaction.
