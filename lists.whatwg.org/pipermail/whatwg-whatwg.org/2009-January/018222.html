I agree that the current use of &quot;members&quot; is confusing.

However, I don't like changing a term immediately from one thing to
another.  Then any use of that term needs to be qualified with a
date.

I also think that the term &quot;contributors&quot; makes it clearer that
there aren't any membership requirements in order to participate.

So I'd prefer to avoid the term &quot;members&quot; entirely by changing the
references to &quot;members&quot; to be &quot;steering committee&quot;, &quot;oversight
committee&quot;, or similar.

This might lead to the section of the charter currently entitled
&quot;Membership&quot; saying something like:

  # Participation and Oversight
  #
  # Anyone can contribute by subscribing to the mailing list. The list
  # of subscribers to the mailing list are termed the contributors.
  #
  # Membership in the oversight committee is by invitation only, and
  # consists of a number of representatives from various browser
  # manufacturers. This group will provide overall guidance as
  # described in the charter above. The members of the oversight
  # committee are currently:
  #
  #   [...]
