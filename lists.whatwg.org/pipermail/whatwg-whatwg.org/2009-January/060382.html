For the record: I disagree with that. I have the impression that no 
matter how many problems are presented, the answer is going to be: &quot;not 
that stone -- fetch me another stone&quot;.

&gt;<i> Alex's suggestion, while officially against spec, has the benefit of

If something that is against the spec is acceptable, then it's *much* 
easier to just use the already defined attributes. Better breaking the 
spec by using new attributes then abusing existing ones.
