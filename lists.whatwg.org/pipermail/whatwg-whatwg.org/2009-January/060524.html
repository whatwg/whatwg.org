Speaking at least from Google's perspective, we've found that the closer 
we get to emulating a browser, the better our results get. I would say 
that even if they don't realise it, authors are by and large acting pretty 
much exactly as Henri describes, and they expect their non-browser tools, 
such as their search engines, to just Do The Right Thing.

This is reflected in the great difficulty we (the standards community) 
have had in convincing authors to use CSS. The mere idea that authors 
should mark up their text as headings and then make their headings big is 
often faced by the simple reply &quot;But I just want my text to be big&quot;.

I'm not trying to draw any value judgements here, though. Personally I'd 
love it if authors could just mark up their content purely semantically 
and have the browsers Do The Right Thing the way that search engines have 
to now based on the few semantics (and ample presentational hints) that 
authors use. But in my experience most authors don't think that way, and 
aren't interested in thinking that way.
