</I>&gt;<i> Ouch! Thanks Anne for the screenshot, otherwise I wouldn't have known
</I>&gt;<i> that it was my comment the one causing the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> My apologies Shelley for that incident. I assure you that it was not
</I>&gt;<i> intentional: it was a quite long post, I used some markup with the
</I>&gt;<i> intention of making it more readable (like italizing the quotes), and
</I>&gt;<i> by the end I messed things up. Thanks to the preview page I noticed

</I>&gt;<i> preview page did: it showed up without issues).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Eduard,  no worries. Your comment just demonstrated that a secondary 
preview after editing is needed to self-catch these types of errors.

Sorry for the misunderstanding. That and Anne's image, and trying to 
wade through the markup and figure out what was going on, because this 
error should have been caught, put me in an irritated mood. Especially 
since I have had people deliberately trip up my comments every time I 
write about XHTML et al (ie the Philipe Anne mentions).

But no worries, and I shouldn't have made such a jump in assumption.
