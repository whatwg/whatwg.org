The reason we separate style from content is that we want content to be 
applicable to multiple media, so that users in a variety of situations can 
have complete access to the page.

I don't currently see a reason to separate the interface from the content. 
It may be that technology develops in a direction where that makes sense, 
for example one could imagine a tool that can dynamically build user 
interfaces around blobs of data, but as an industry we are far from that 
point and frankly there isn't really much indication that we'll get there 
any time soon.

In the meantime it makes sense to keep things as simple as makes sense, 
which in this case means keeping the style and data separate, but 
considering logic, interface, and content together.

Note that if you want to create content that separates these aspects, 
there are technologies that either allow or enforce such separation, such 
as XForms and XBL.
