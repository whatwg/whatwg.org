If it is true that RDFa can work today with no ill-effect in downlevel 
user-agents, what's currently blocking its implementation? Concern for 
validation?

It seems to me that many HTML extensions are implemented first and 
specified later[1], so perhaps it would be in the interests of RDFa 
proponents to get some implementations out there and get RDFa adopted, 
at which point it will hopefully seem a much more useful proposition for 
inclusion in HTML5.

In the short term the RDFa community can presumably provide a 
specialized &quot;HTML5 + RDFa&quot; validator for adopters to use until RDFa is 
incorporated into the core spec and tools.

It would seem that it's much easier to get into the spec when your 
feature is proven to be useful by real-world adoption.



[1] canvas, keygen, frames and script are examples of this phenomenon.
