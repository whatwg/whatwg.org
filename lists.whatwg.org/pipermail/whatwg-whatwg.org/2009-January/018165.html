Since we have implementations, and implementors don't seem willing to 
remove it, I haven't removed the 'delete' functionality for Storage.

I have, however, removed the similar functionality in UndoManager, lest 
someone implement it.

Well, .watch() supported by some UAs somewhat goes against this. But ok.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'd also like the &quot;delete&quot; operator to work on DOMStringMap (for the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; removing the underlying attribute) and UndoManager (where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side-effect is to remove the entry and renumber the following entries, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so maybe that's not such a good idea after all), for what it's worth. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we want to decide that we're not supporting this, we should decide 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that before implementations of those come about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those both sound suboptimal to me. UndoManager because it remove more

</I>&gt;<i> NamedNodeMap to remove an attribute so it would be inconsistent and (b) 
</I>&gt;<i> removing an attribute causes a mutation event to fire and thus runs 
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary code (creating the same problem of 'delete' running arbitrary 
</I>&gt;<i> code as Storage).

</I>&gt;<i> A bold choice, but I would not recommend it as the sole available

</I>
See above for UndoManager, but for DOMStringMap I don't want to add any 
other mechanisms, because they introduce name clashes. Right now the IDL 
for DOMStringMap is:

   [NameCreator, NameDeleter, NameGetter, NameSetter]
   interface DOMStringMap {};

It basically emulates a JS Object. It's intended only for JS. I don't see 
why this is a bad idea.
