Well, it's something that we probably want to keep in mind, because
it's so relevant for the success of any such proposal.  I wouldn't
want to lend support to a feature that turned out to be immediately
useless due to spam.  Lot of wasted effort on the WG's, Ian's, and
possibly browser developer's part.

To answer your specific question, &lt;title&gt; is under the control of the
site author, and search engines already have elaborate methods to tell
a spammy site from a hammy one, thus downranking them.

On the other hand, the hypothetical attack scenario I outlined was
about metadata that could be added to the page by external parties.

If we were today discussing adding &lt;title&gt; to HTML5 to help search
engines provide a short summary of a page, and part of the proposal
might allow blog commenters to change the title of pages on a whim,
I'd certainly be equally concerned.  ^_^
