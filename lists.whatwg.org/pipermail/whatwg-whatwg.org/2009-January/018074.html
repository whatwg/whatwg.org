The process is described here:

   <A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F</A>

Deciding whether we need to address a problem or set of use cases is a 
judgement call. The more people a problem affects, the stronger the case 
for fixing it.

Right now I'm still trying to work out what the problem is; most of the 
discussions seem to be centering around RDF, RDFa, and microformats, which 
are solutions, not problems. It has been asserted that problems exist, and 
that they have characteristics for which RDFa is suitable as a solution, 
but detailed descriptions of the problems themselves have been rather 
lacking. Without a clear description of the problem(s) of relevance, 
discussing solutions is meaningless, for we can't evaluate them.

Things that are impossible just take longer.   `._.-(,_..'--(,_..'`-.;.'
