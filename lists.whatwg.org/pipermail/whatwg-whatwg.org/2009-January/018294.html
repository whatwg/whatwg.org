<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like some way to add meta data to a page that could be integrated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the UA's copy/paste commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These use cases are a good start, but the problem is that you've begun with
</I>&gt;<i> the assumption that copy and paste would be a part of the solution.
</I>
That's not a bug, it's a feature :)

Ian said a while ago that coming up with end-user friendly UI ideas
for the RDF stuff was harder than doing the technical work - implying
that if there are no good UI ideas, browser vendors would not find a
nice way to let users use metadata, and many of the use cases for
embedding it in HTML would not really be feasible.

Thus, this *is* a UI proposal, aiming to show that an operation nearly
*all* users are familiar with could be enhanced with richer ways to
embed meta data in HTML.

&gt;&gt;<i> For example, if I copy a sentence from Wikipedia and paste it in some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> word processor, it would be great if the word processor offered to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically create a bibliographic entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you mean a bibliographic entry that references the source web site, and
</I>&gt;<i> included information such as the URL, title, publication date and author
</I>&gt;<i> names?
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i>  That could be a useful feature, even if it could only obtain the URL
</I>&gt;<i> and title easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Often, when writing an article that quotes several websites, it's a time
</I>&gt;<i> consuming process to copy and paste the quote, then the page or article
</I>&gt;<i> title and then the URL to link to it.  An editor with a Paste as Quotation
</I>&gt;<i> feature which helped automate that would be useful.
</I>
It would be great. I hate the clumsy back-and-forward switching to
copy/paste all those bits of information ;-p

&gt;<i> HTML5 already contains elements that can be used to help obtain this
</I>&gt;<i> information, such as the &lt;title&gt;, &lt;article&gt; and it's associated heading &lt;h1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> to &lt;h6&gt; and &lt;time&gt;.  Obtaining author names might be a little more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult, though perhaps hCard might help.
</I>
Indeed. And it's not an either-or counter-suggestion to my proposal,
UAs could fall back to extracting such data if more structured meta
data is not available.

&gt;&gt;<i> If I copy the name of one of my Facebook &quot;friends&quot; and paste it into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my OS address book, it would be cool if the contact information was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imported automatically. Or maybe I pasted it in my webmail's address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> book feature, and the same import operation happened..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe this problem is adequately addressed by the hCard microformat and
</I>&gt;<i> various browser extensions that are available for some browsers, like
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox.  The solution doesn't need to involve a copy and paste operation.
</I>&gt;<i>  It just needs a way to select contact info on the page and export it to an
</I>&gt;<i> address book.
</I>
This is way more complicated for most users. Your last sentence IMO is
not an appropriate way to use the word &quot;just&quot;, seeing that you need to
find and invoke an &quot;export&quot; command, handle files, find and invoke an
&quot;import&quot; command and clear out the duplicated entries.. This is
impossible for several users I can think of, and even for techies like
us doing so repeatedly will eventually be a chore (even if we CAN, it
doesn't mean that's the way we SHOULD be working).

Besides, it doesn't really address the &quot;copy ONE contact's
information&quot; use case well.

Also, should any program that wants to support copy-and-paste of
contact information have to support text/html parsing and look for
class=&quot;&quot; values? I guess that would be quite some work for the rather
limited functionality microformats gives you. It would be better with
a microformat-aware UA generating a common meta data interchange
format for the clipboard, and from there there it seems a small step
to allow web page authors to embed richer meta data the UA can use to
generate the clipboard meta data, right there in their HTML.

&gt;&gt;<i> If I select an E-mail in my webmail and copy it, it would be awesome
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if my desktop mail client would just import the full E-mail with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complete headers and different parts if I just switch to the mail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client app and paste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't this be solved by the web mail server providing an export feature
</I>&gt;<i> which let the user download the email as an .eml file and open it with their
</I>&gt;<i> mail client?
</I>
Of course, that or POP/IMAP access is the way things currently work.

&gt;<i> Again, I don't believe the solution to this requires a copy
</I>&gt;<i> and paste operation.
</I>
..but I think it would be more intuitive and user friendly if
something like that worked. (Or drag-and-drop an E-mail from the
webmail to the desktop client/file system/other webmail, which is
basically the same thing).

&gt;<i> However, I'm not sure what problem you're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> solve.  Why would a user want to do this?  Why can't users who want to
</I>&gt;<i> access their email using a mail client use POP or IMAP?
</I>
Granted this use case is a bit more far-fetched (but I know people who
copy E-mails from their Outlook and paste in Windows Explorer! - for
&quot;backing up&quot; or archiving a message they want to keep).
