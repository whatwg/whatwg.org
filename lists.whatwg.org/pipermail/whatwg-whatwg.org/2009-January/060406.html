In principle, I agree (also, Atom 1.0 embedding RDFa as dataRSS is the 
base of SearchMonkey). But if people feel the need to embed metadata in 
their documents and to use them as a distributed database, well, let's 
give them a chance to do so. :-P

eRDF might be a working compromise, because it doesn't need any changes 
to the spec; RDFa covers a wider range of RDF semantics, but requires 
new attributes and also namespaces (a sort of hybrid beteween them might 
avoid the need to bring namespaces - xmlns:* attributes - into html 
serialization). My suggestion was meant as a mean to test RDFa in HTML 
documents without changing the spec (perhaps in conjunction with 
data-xmlns-*, data-xmlns-prefixes=&quot;rdfa foaf &lt;whatever&gt;&quot; to &quot;emulate&quot; 
namespaces - an ugly hack, I know, but at least would avoid changes to 
html serialization, at least in a test phase) -- even if I think that 
xml serialization should work better for such rdf metadata.

WBR, Alex
