<PRE>&gt;<i> Now wait a second, you're changing the parameters of the requirements.

</I>
[Put &quot;almost&quot; in front of most words in the following.]

The consistent DOM criteria is necessary but not not sufficient.

Browsers doing something with it is a step towards sufficient.

Without DOM consistency (or at least an agreed workaround), it almost
doesn't matter how great RFDa is, because it isn't compatible.  Once
you have that consistency, then the questions can move on to the next
step.

That next step boils down to &quot;Why bother?&quot;  Needing DOM integration of
the information is a reason to bother.  Browsers doing something with
it is a reason to bother.  Those aren't the only reasons to bother,
but they are likely reasons, so people have asked about them.  If you
have other reasons, go ahead and offer those as well.  (But &quot;existing
W3C standard&quot; probably isn't strong enough.)
