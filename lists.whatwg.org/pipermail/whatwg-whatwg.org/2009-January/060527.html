&gt;<i> My apologies for not responding sooner to this thread. You see, one of

</I>&gt;<i> page to break. I am using XHTML at my site, because I want to  
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate inline SVG, in addition to RDFa. An unfortunate consequence  
</I>&gt;<i> of XHTML is its less than forgiving nature regarding playful pranks such  
</I>&gt;<i> as this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm assuming the WhatWG member thought the act was clever. It was,

</I>&gt;<i> while loading the page in a browser, and I made sure to note that such  
</I>&gt;<i> breakage was courtesy of a WhatWG member, who decided that perhaps I  
</I>&gt;<i> should just shut up, here and at my site, about the Important Work  
</I>&gt;<i> people(?) here are doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the person only highlighted why it is so important that  
</I>&gt;<i> something such as RDFa, and SVG, and MathML, get a home in HTML5. XHTML  
</I>&gt;<i> is hard to support when you're allowing comments and external input.  
</I>&gt;<i> Typically my filters will catch the accidental input of crappy markup,  
</I>&gt;<i> but not the intentional. Not yet. I'm not an exerpt at markup, but I  
</I>&gt;<i> know more than the average person. And the average person most likely  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have my commitment, either.

<A HREF="http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/01/xml-sunday">http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/01/xml-sunday</A> shows the commentor (who by  
the way seems to be on your side in this debate) simply forgot to escape  
&lt;self-closed /&gt; and then WordPress somehow messed up in an attempt to fix  
it. I don't think anyone tries to make you &quot;shut up&quot;.


(And if we, the evil WHATWG cabal, wanted to break your site, we would've  
asked Philip` ;-))
