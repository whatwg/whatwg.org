When did I ignore it? I discussed it in depth in my e-mail in December, 
listing a number of use cases and requirements that I thought it 
demonstrated, and asking if there were any others I'd missed.


&gt;<i> Before I invest significant time in responding to your barrage of

</I>
All I'm trying to do is evaluate things objectively. I don't know how much 
more I can &quot;hint&quot; towards this.

Indeed, every question I asked in the aforementioned e-mail had no reason 
_other_ than to enable me to objectively evaluate the proposals.


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that search engines aren't the problem here
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, we were discussing SearchMonkey, so I think it's very much the 
</I>&gt;<i> context for this sub-thread.
</I>
I meant that search engines weren't the problem when it came to spam. 
Search engines can deal with distributed spam. The techniques developed to 
combat distributed spam don't really work on the scale of a single user's 
machine and browser.
