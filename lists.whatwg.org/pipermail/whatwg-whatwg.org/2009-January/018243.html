</I>
I'm explaining how SVG, MathML and SQL are different from RDF(a) in a  
way that's very relevant to the practice of including stuff in the spec.

&gt;<i> Before, the criteria was based on the DOM. Now you're saying that  
</I>&gt;<i> the browsers actually have to do with something with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who is to say what the browsers will do with RDF in the future?
</I>
<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-August/016045.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-August/016045.html</A> 
  is a message where one of the editors of RDFa mentions RDFa together  
with &quot;client-side tools like Ubiquity&quot;. That Ubiquity is a Firefox  
extension rather than part of the core feature set is an  
implementation detail. I read this as envisioning browser-sensitivity  
to RDFa.

&gt;<i> In addition, is that the criteria for pages on the web -- that every  
</I>&gt;<i> element in them has to result in different behaviors in browsers,  
</I>&gt;<i> only?
</I>
No. However, most of the time, when people publish HTML, they do it to  
elicit browser behavior when a user loads the HTML document in a  
browser.

&gt;&gt;<i> Meanwhile, the feed example you gave--RSS 1.0--shows how the feed  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec community knowingly moved away from RDF with RSS 2.0 and Atom.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, RSS 1.0 usually isn't parsed into an RDF graph but is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> treated as XML instead. If RSS 1.0 is evidence, it's evidence  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *against* RDF.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The point I'm making is that you set a precedent, and a good one I  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think: giving precedence to &quot;not invented here&quot;. In other words,  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to not re-invent new ways of doing something, but to look for  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> established processes, models, et al already in place,  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implemented, vetted, etc, that solve specific problems. Now that  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you have accepted a use case, Martin's, and we've established that  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RDFa solves the problem associated with the use case, the issue  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then becomes is there another data model already as vetted,  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> documented, implemented that would better solve the problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Clearly, RDFa wasn't properly vetted--as far as the desire to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deploy it in text/html goes--when the outcome was that it ended up  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using markup that doesn't parse into the DOM the same way in HTML  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and XML.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SVG and MathML were both created as XML, and hence were not vetted  
</I>&gt;<i> for text/html, either. And yet, here they are. Well, here they'll  
</I>&gt;<i> be, eventually.
</I>
Actually, the creators of MathML had the good sense and foresight to  
avoid name collisions with HTML even after Namespaces theoretically  
gave them a permission not to care.

Unlike the creators of RDFa, the creators of SVG weren't pushing for  
inclusion in HTML5 or saying that it's OK to serve their XML as text/ 
html--quite the contrary. And the integration would have been nicer if  
the SVG WG had had the same prudence as the Math WG.

&gt;<i> Come to that -- I don't think the creators of SQL actually ever  
</I>&gt;<i> expected that someday SQL  queries would be initiated from HTML pages.
</I>

I don't see the creators of SQL asking for the inclusion of their  
stuff in HTML after building on another spec that is well-known to be  
trouble with HTML (Namespaces in XML in the RDFa case).
