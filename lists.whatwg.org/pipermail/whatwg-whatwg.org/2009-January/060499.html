I understand. Perhaps, if a main (more diffused) behaviour could be 
isolated, it might be chosen to &quot;normalize&quot; newer UAs behaviours, while 
possibly breaking fewer existing pages (the same eventually behaving 
differently in different browsers). However, I guess this might require 
a convergence between HTML and CSS specifications for this purpose (it 
might rise an issue on consistence for @import rules, for instance, 
which are in CSS scope).

I don't know if it may work something like establishing that a URL, in 
this case, is resolved any times it is explicitly set (e.g. when the 
document is parsed and when the &quot;href&quot; value changes), as if the 
resources were immediately fetched (thus, not being affected by a 
successive change in a &lt;base&gt;) but not constraining UAs to do so (an 
inline style element might be treated as an external resource being yet 
fetched, thus it would be about to associate it with a base URI being 
valid at the moment the style was created and maintained valid until the 
style content is explicitely changed). Though, I guess this should be 
somehow consistent with existing UAs and pages (or, at least, with a 
significant group).
