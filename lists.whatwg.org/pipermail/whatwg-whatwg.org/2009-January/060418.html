There does appear to be some of this. I have no idea if that is just an  
impression or the truth. Hence my continued following of the thread.

&gt;&gt;<i> Alex's suggestion, while officially against spec, has the benefit of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience.  That's the back door into the spec, after all; you don't

</I>
Indeed. I the data-* attributes had some reserved values, then one might  
expect people to invest in them on the scale that they have typically made  
RDF investments. But then there would be no need to change the attribute  
names at all (nor, for that matter, to put much effort into other  
attribute names following the design pattern. It just becomes another  
approach to namespaces with another centralisation process required). The  
question is what would convince the editors of the spec that there is in  
fact a use case for RDF in HTML which is what has led to the request to  
include RDFa (a form of RDF carefully designed to fit into HTML).
