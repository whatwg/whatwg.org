Now wait a second, you're changing the parameters of the requirements. 
Before, the criteria was based on the DOM. Now you're saying that the 
browsers actually have to do with something with it.

Who is to say what the browsers will do with RDF in the future?

In addition, is that the criteria for pages on the web -- that every 
element in them has to result in different behaviors in browsers, only? 
What about other user agents?

That seems to me to be looking for RDFa sized holes and them throwing 
them into the criteria, specifically to trip up RDF, and hence, RDFa.


&gt;<i> Meanwhile, the feed example you gave--RSS 1.0--shows how the feed spec 
</I>&gt;<i> community knowingly moved away from RDF with RSS 2.0 and Atom. 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, RSS 1.0 usually isn't parsed into an RDF graph but is 
</I>&gt;<i> treated as XML instead. If RSS 1.0 is evidence, it's evidence 
</I>&gt;<i> *against* RDF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The point I'm making is that you set a precedent, and a good one I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think: giving precedence to &quot;not invented here&quot;. In other words, to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not re-invent new ways of doing something, but to look for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> established processes, models, et al already in place, implemented, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vetted, etc, that solve specific problems. Now that you have accepted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a use case, Martin's, and we've established that RDFa solves the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem associated with the use case, the issue then becomes is there 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another data model already as vetted, documented, implemented that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would better solve the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly, RDFa wasn't properly vetted--as far as the desire to deploy 
</I>&gt;<i> it in text/html goes--when the outcome was that it ended up using 
</I>&gt;<i> markup that doesn't parse into the DOM the same way in HTML and XML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>SVG and MathML were both created as XML, and hence were not vetted for 
text/html, either. And yet, here they are. Well, here they'll be, 
eventually.

Come to that -- I don't think the creators of SQL actually ever expected 
that someday SQL  queries would be initiated from HTML pages.
