Then why would a button be needed to &quot;activate&quot; standalone mode? What is the
actual webapp doing differently? Shouldn't the webapp be acting the exact
same? Sounds like it's the UA that would act differently.

Great to know. Prism has code that allows &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;command&gt; elements to
be used to add menuitems to the Dock (Trayicon on Windows) menu as well. We
could even support something like &lt;menu type=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;...&lt;/menu&gt; for this too.
Ignored by UAs that don't support it.

</I>&gt;<i> This isn't something we get to disagree with. When a browser vendor says

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  * It would be better if this mechanism could integrate with the menu/

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why isn't this &quot;feature&quot; skipped and the menu/command used instead (when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needed)? when the app tries to use the menu/command the browser can

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what you are suggesting here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am suggesting that an explicit &quot;push to make a standalone app&quot; button
isn't needed. Any webapp is already able to run standalone. _If_ there is
some reason, for security or code privilege, that an explicit action or
confirmation is needed on the part of the user, such confirmation should be
enforced at the point of execution, when the user attempts to do something
that might be dangerous.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One possibility for addressing these requirements would be an element
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that acts as a link, button, or icon, or some such, and which invokes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; user agent features. Something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   &lt;browserbutton type=&quot;makeapp&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ...where &quot;type&quot; has a value to provide the page as a standalone Web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; app, a value to make the browser perform feed autodetection on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; page and subscribe to the relevant feed, a value to print the page,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; overengineered overkill . let's just stick to the real features that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; webapps need to act more standalone and worry less about in-page badges
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really sure how this resolves the problem of offering the page to
</I>&gt;<i> the user as a &quot;download&quot; for turning it into a standalone application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
IMO, it's a problem that doesn't need to be solved. Any webapp (or webpage)
can be turned into a standalone application without any effort on the part
of the webapp (or webpage).
