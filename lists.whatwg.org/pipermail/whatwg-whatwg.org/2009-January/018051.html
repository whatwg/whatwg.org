I think the supporters of RDFa (me included) claim that Microformats 
only address a subset of the problem solved by RDFa.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So why RDFa and not Microformats?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I think the question should be why RDFa is needed *as well as* &#181;formats)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is correct.  Microformats exist already.  They solve current
</I>&gt;<i> problems.  Are there further problems that Microformats don't address
</I>&gt;<i> which can be solved well by RDFa?  Are these problems significant
</I>&gt;<i> enough to authors to be worth addressing in the spec, or can we wait
</I>&gt;<i> and let the community work out its own solutions further before we
</I>&gt;<i> make a move?  We generally want to wait until a given item is truly
</I>&gt;<i> established before speccing it, so that we can work with existing
</I>
Oh really? That's news to me.

If this is principle we agree on that we really should start cutting 
lots of things from the spec.
