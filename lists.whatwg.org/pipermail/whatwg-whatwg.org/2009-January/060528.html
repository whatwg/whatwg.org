</I>You're not seeing all of the markup that caused problems, Anne. The 
intention was to crash the post. However, I shouldn't have assumed that 
the person who inserted the markup that caused the problems is a WhatWG 
member. My apologies.

Regardless of intent, it does demonstrate, again, why it is important 
for RDFa, SVG, and MathML find a home in HTML5. XHTML is a very 
difficult markup to support when you're allowing outside input. The 
tools do not do a good job of supporting XHTML, and hence the average 
person finds such failures to be intimidating, and will immediately 
return to HTML. Heck, I find the yellow screen of death to be unnerving 
myself. It's only my interest in inline SVG and RDFa, and basically 
distributed extensibility, that keeps me trying.

And regardless of the fact that I jumped to conclusions about WhatWG 
membership, I do not believe I was inaccurate with the earlier part of 
this email. Sam started a new thread in the discussion about the issues 
of namespace and how, perhaps we could find a way to work the issues 
through with RDFa. My god, I use RDFa in my pages, and they load fine 
with any browser, including IE. I have to believe its incorporation into 
HTML5 is not the daunting effort that others make it seem to be.'

However, the debate ended as soon as Ian re-asserted his authority.
