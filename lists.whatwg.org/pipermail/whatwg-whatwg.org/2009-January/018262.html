Just so that we have all of the data available to make an informed
decision, do we have examples of how it would &quot;break the web&quot; if
attributes which started with the characters &quot;xmlns:&quot; (and *only*
those attribute) were placed into the DOM exactly as they would be
when those bytes are processed as XHTML?

Notes: I am *not* suggesting anything just yet, other than the
gathering of this data.  I also recognize that this would require a
parsing change by browser vendors, which also is a cost that needs to
be factored in.  But right now, I am interested in how it would affect
the web if this were done.
