</I>
Somewhat of an aside, but for the curious - here is an RDFa 
parser/processor app:

<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/wiki/Introduction">http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery/wiki/Introduction</A>
example: <A HREF="http://rdfquery.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/markup/markup.html">http://rdfquery.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/markup/markup.html</A>
js: <A HREF="http://rdfquery.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.rdfa.js">http://rdfquery.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.rdfa.js</A>

[...]

&gt;&gt;<i> The most successful alternative is nothing at all. ^_^ We can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extract copious data from web pages reliably without metadata, either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using our human senses (in personal use) or natural-language-based

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's what you and Ian claim. Many disagree.
</I>
My main problem with the natural language processing option is that it 
feels too close to waiting for Artificial Intelligence. I'd rather add 6 
attributes to HTML and get on with life.

But perhaps a more practical concern is that it unfairly biases things 
towards popular languages - lucky English, lucky Spanish, etc., and 
those that lend themselves more to NLP analysis. The Web is for 
everyone, and people shouldn't be forced to read and write English to 
enjoy the latest advances in Web automation. Since HTML5 is going 
through W3C, such considerations need to be taken pretty seriously.

&gt;&gt;<i> As a note, this isn't the W3C's HTML WG. The WHATWG is independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the W3C.
</I>
But the WHATWG HTML5 *work* is no longer entirely independent of W3C; 
the two organizations embarked on a major joint venture. It seems 
reasonable for members of the WHATWG world to take W3C-oriented 
considerations seriously, regardless of mailing list.

cheers,

Dan
