For the record: I completely agree with Julian. This is why I haven't
jumped into this thread yet again.

The key piece of evidence here is SearchMonkey, a product by Yahoo that
specifically uses RDFa. Even its microformat support funnels everything
to an RDF-like metadata approach. With thousands of application
developers and some concrete examples that specifically use RDFa (the
Creative Commons application being one of them), the message from many
on this list remains &quot;not good enough.&quot;

I'm not sure where the bar is, but it seems far from objective.
