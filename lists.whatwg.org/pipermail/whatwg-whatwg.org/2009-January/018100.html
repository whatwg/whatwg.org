No. There is no reason for most developers to prefer one over the other  
under the circumstances described.

Clearly Google has an investment in text-harvesting in a bunch of  
languages. Equally clearly its competitors who are more sucessfeul in  
various languages (Yandex, Baidu, etc) have an investment in the  
technology they use.

But developing a new indexing process, there is no a priori reason to  
favour NLP over some other technique that is also satisfactory, and if you  
happen to be interested in a global market, it makes sense to develop a  
system that can be more easily adapted, other things being equal.
...
&gt;<i> Instead of bearing the cost of developing a totally alternative

</I>&gt;<i> spillover from the effort done for the top-tier languages, it makes more

</I>&gt;<i> developed for the top-tier languages.
</I>
Except that it turns out that the re-usable parts of most search engines,  
for the general developer, are pretty limited. Whereas the re-usable parts  
of the RDF stack are numerous, available for many different platforms,  
 from GPL open source to bespoke commercial closed-source and everything  
between.

All this does not necessarily establish the case for using RDF in HTML, it  
is just meant to demonstrate that this particular case *against* doesn't  
seem to be established, to me.
