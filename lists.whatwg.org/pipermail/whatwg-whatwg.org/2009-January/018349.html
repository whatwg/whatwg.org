<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, but I think your comment misses half of the proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution.. namely what format the UA puts the information on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clipboard in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Determining how one application passes information via the clipboard to
</I>&gt;<i> another application seems very much out of scope of HTML.
</I>
If we keep considering clipboard support &quot;out of scope&quot; it means web
applications will continue to SUCK at copy/paste support. Copy&amp;paste /
drag&amp;drop is a UI workhorse the Web and its applications generally
can't take much advantage of now. We should do something about that
(where &quot;we&quot; is not necessarily the WHATWG/HTML5 WG, it might also and
possibly more likely be a WebApps WG task - I don't care where it's
done as long as it is done.).

&gt;<i>  If there was such
</I>&gt;<i> a method available, then we could investigate how to obtain the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> semantics from the document.  But we can't do that until there is some
</I>&gt;<i> clipboard format available for this purpose that other applications can
</I>&gt;<i> understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that it would be possible to create some generic format that would
</I>&gt;<i> be suitable for such a wide range of use cases.
</I>
That, of course, is what the RDF people claim to be doing. Whether it
makes sense and would get used I have no idea, but implementing some
rudimentary support for putting some RDF-markup on the clipboard and
retrieving it would let the Web have a go at figuring out if it IS
usable for information exchange, and shouldn't take too much work if
the generic clipboard API is in place. That's why I like this idea -
from my naturally browser-vendor-centric perspective :-)

&gt;<i> For an address book
</I>&gt;<i> application, the most sensible approach would be to add a vCard format
</I>&gt;<i> (text/directory;profile=vcard) to the clipboard.
</I>
I assume you'll answer the &quot;where should the UA find the structured
information in order to place it on the clipboard&quot; question with
&quot;vCard microformat&quot;.
