Sam's point here bears repeating, because there seems to be an impression 
that we took on SVG and MathML without any consideration, while RDF is 
getting an unfair reception.

On the contrary, SVG and MathML got the same reception. For MathML, for 
instance, a number of options were very seriously considered, most notably 
LaTeX. For SVG, we considered a variety of options including VML.

I would encourage people to read the e-mail Sam cited:

   <A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-April/014372.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-April/014372.html</A>

It's long, but the start of it is a summary of what was considered and 
shows that the same process derived from use cases was used for SVG and 
MathML as is being used on this thread here.
