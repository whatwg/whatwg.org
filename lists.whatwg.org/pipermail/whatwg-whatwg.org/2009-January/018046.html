If the data production and consumption are both under the control of  
one entity (Opera in this case), why does the solution need to be  
engineered for spontaneous integration of decentralized data sources?

Do the savings of using off-the-shelf tools outweigh the cost they  
impose by not being quite right for any specific purpose? Presumably  
the Opera-specific processing is more significant than generic  
parsing. Or is it?

It seems that RDFa is motivated by private data and by interchange at  
the same time. This suggests multiple bilateral access control  
agreements instead of a Web-like system where data is made available  
for GETting without prior agreement between the parties.
