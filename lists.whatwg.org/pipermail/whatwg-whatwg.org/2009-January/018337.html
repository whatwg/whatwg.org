<PRE>2009/1/27 K&#345;i&#353;tof &#381;elechovski &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">kkz at mimuw.edu.pl</A>&gt;

&gt;<i>  The original use of the spellcheck attribute was to switch spell checking
</I>&gt;<i> off
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, the _original_ use was to turn it on on fields where it would otherwise
have been on.

&gt;<i> (I think we both believe it should generally be on).  Using a private
</I>&gt;<i> language for the control would do the trick equally well, without
</I>&gt;<i> introducing a new attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It wouldn't do it equally well, since semantically, it would mean &quot;this is
of language &lt;private&gt;&quot;, which will be strictly inaccurate.

&gt;<i>   Avoiding an additional attribute is a gain,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why?

&gt;<i> If the language detection libraries are as good as you claim, why is
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox unable to use them in a way that is not annoying?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Because no one has had the time or energy to devote to this?  I have worked
full-time on browsers for a number of years now and have never seen any team
with the time to fix all the things that could or should be fixed.

&gt;<i> As I have already mentioned, GMail should provide an option for the sender
</I>&gt;<i> to inform the recipient about the language used in the message, not for the
</I>&gt;<i> client-side spell checker, but for the recipient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Which no one will ever use, because users aren't going to take the trouble
to declare such a thing when human recipients can just _read the text_.
 After all, WE have built-in language detectors in our heads.

&gt;<i> We can drop the suggestion language=&quot;auto&quot; if you wish, but it would be an
</I>&gt;<i> explicit way of informing the user that he is allowed to enter text in any
</I>&gt;<i> language he pleases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As if users aren't going to just enter whatever language they please into
any field they wish?  We design software that has to accommodate people, not
the other way around :)

I have no idea whether there are better things web apps and UAs can do
w.r.t. communicating what languages are used where.  All I know is that both
in the abtstract and practically, whether I want a field spellchecked by
default is a distinct concern from which language(s) would be used to
spellcheck it.  Therefore I continue to see the spellcheck attribute as
distinct from (though possibly complimentary to) language.
