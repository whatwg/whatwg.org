Well as Anne says below, we want to make sure that we pick what the 
behavior is so that it is sane so that if anyone does end up depending on 
it, we don't have to spec something insane. That's happened a lot. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not really sure how to unspecify that without adding a really 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weird clause like &quot;in the event that the attribute is changed, user 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agents may, whenever convenient, pretend, for the sake of url 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resolution, that it has not changed&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is that weird?  Even if it is, why is being weird worse than 
</I>&gt;<i> creating an implementation burden of something which nobody will use 
</I>&gt;<i> (except by accident)?
</I>
It's weird because it's not predictable.

&quot;By accident&quot; is the problem. It's when people accidentally rely on 
misfeatures that are unintended and that rely on weird implementation 
details that we end up with weirdness in the spec.

Right.

I think the current text in the spec is pretty reasonable at this point. 
The main text is here:

   <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dynamic-changes-to-base-urls">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dynamic-changes-to-base-urls</A>

...and other parts of the spec ensure that the &quot;Otherwise&quot; clause in that 
section is true (e.g. by carefully defining when a URL is resolved and 
then not resolving it again in the algorithms).

I haven't yet covered style=&quot;&quot; attributes. The problem with CSS is that 
there is no clear point at which URLs are resolved... can we say it 
happens during parsing, so that the absolute URLs computed for the first 
cascade are set once and for all?

It's weird, but then so is changing the base URL.


&gt;<i> (Also, would setting href or src to itself in such a case trigger a load 
</I>&gt;<i> of a different resource?)
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> I have to admit I am not especially excited about implementing instant

</I>&gt;<i> it triggers a load or not, when the &lt;base&gt; element is changed. That

</I>
Agreed; I've tried to keep this to a bare minimum. Basically only links 
shown in UI need be updated, if we can get away with saying that CSS 
resolves URLs during parsing.

The UI updates are only a &quot;should&quot;, too, since they're not really required 
for interoperability. (I recommend doing it, though, since the URL that is 
resolved when the link is clicked would differ from what the user saw in 
the UI, otherwise.)
