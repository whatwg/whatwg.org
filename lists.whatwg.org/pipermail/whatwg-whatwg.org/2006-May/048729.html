I didn't say sandboxes are overkill. The concept of sandboxing is a result  
of analyzing vulnerabilities found in modern web applications, like CMS,  
blogs, forums etc. They do need that level of control.

What I said is that sandboxes is a long way to go, something that probably  
won't be in common use in the next several years. However, there is a  
whole class of attacks which can be prevented by a much simpler measure,  
and that's what I was writing about.

&gt;&gt;<i> 9. Optionally, execution time limit may be imposed on the thread, so  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it doesn't make the document unrenderable by running an endless  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loop inside CSS expression().
</I>
&gt;<i> Of course. I like Gecko and Konqueror got the execution time limit. It's  
</I>&gt;<i> something important, since authors can create malicious pages which  
</I>&gt;<i> bring down the entire browser.
</I>
Actually, the execution time limit is somewhat out of scope, I just  
mentioned it because it came to my head. The limit is useful in many other  
places than those I listed, for example, for event listeners. However,  
even if such a limit is not imposed, a well-designed browser won't be  
taken down by an endless loop in a script: maybe the page will become  
unresponsive, but other open pages will be usable.

&gt;&gt;<i> The above is very raw thoughts. I'd like to hear some feedback on the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea itself.
</I>
&gt;<i> Interesting thoughts, but I don't know why I don't find myself  
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiastic about the &quot;side-effect free script&quot; notion you've detailed.
</I>
I would insist on taking only rational arguments into account.

&gt;<i> Maybe something better is still needed.
</I>
Maybe someone else will offer something better.
