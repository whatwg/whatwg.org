I might seem picky, but I don't really like how loop() takes a
*playcount* param.

loop() = infinite
loop(1) = play once
loop(2) = play twice

It's the loop(n) that bugs me. I see loop(1) and think that the file
is going to play once and then loop once. (The first time it plays is
not a looped play.)

Luckily, I saw the spec and read that the parameter is NOT how many
times to loop, but how many times to play, hence *playcount*.

Not seeing the spec, if I wanted to *specifically* set the file to
only play once, I'd do loop(0), which to me would mean, play once and
not loop at all. Loop is usualy a boolean value anyway.

The following makes more sense to me:

playcount() = infinite
playcount(1) play once
playcount(2) play twice
playcount(-x) throw error
playcount(0) throw error ( Or don't throw an error and just don't
play. Can't think of a use case for that, but maybe someone can.)

On a side note, the Windows Media Plugin param PlayCount works like this:

playcount = 0 - infinite
playcount = n - number of times to play

I can see people doing loop(0) to try to turn off looping if they
previously set loop(99) for example. Getting rid of loop() and using
playcount() would clear things up IMO.

Of course, I could just be crazy. :)

I agree though, an error should be thrown for loop() for anything less than 1.
