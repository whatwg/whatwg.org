It certainly isn't my intention to add such elements so far, as I've heard 
nobody asking for them. Do you think they would be useful? They seem a bit 
specific. HTML just represents documents (for some definition of 
&quot;document&quot; that includes &quot;application&quot;, at this point), it doesn't have 
the ability natively to say &quot;this is a letter&quot;, &quot;this is a resume&quot;, &quot;this 
is a review&quot;, etc. I don't think we really want to go there.


&gt;<i> Exactly where does this end?
</I>
Wherever we want it to end. In general we want to aim for the 80% case, I 
think. Your implied suggestion seems to be that vCard and iCalendar are 
not in the 80% case. That's certainly possible.


&gt;<i> 1) When using XHTML, is there any benefit the &lt;card&gt; and &lt;calendar&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> elements plus hCard and hCalendar would give over something like RDF 
</I>&gt;<i> vCard[3]?
</I>
It's hard to see any benefit that using hCard and hCalendar _wouldn't_ 
give over using RDF. :-)


&gt;<i> 2) What standards bodies control hCard and hCalendar?
</I>
microformats.org is the closest to a standards body that currently 
controls those specs. But I assume you knew that, so I'm not sure what 
you're really asking here.


&gt;<i> 3) If we're going to create markup to essentially &quot;bind&quot; microformats, 
</I>&gt;<i> why not have more general elements for this purpose rather than two 
</I>&gt;<i> elements that target specific microformats?
</I>
I'm not sure what more general element you would need, given that 
microformats are doing quite fine without anything more than HTML4 
provides.

Note that &lt;card&gt; and &lt;calendar&gt; weren't originally intended to &quot;bind&quot; to 
microformats, but to whole-sale import the syntax of hCard and hCalendar. 
It's not clear whether we'll be able to do that, given the quality of the 
hCard and hCalendar specs right now.


&gt;<i> 4) It's beginning to look like microformats are just a way of getting 
</I>&gt;<i> around HTML's own lack of namespace support. Are standardized 
</I>&gt;<i> microformats really any better than the HTML namespaces Internet 
</I>&gt;<i> Explorer introduced?
</I>
Namespaces using prefixes as in XMLNS really aren't well understood by 
authors. I'm not sure adding namespace support would be a good move.

I'm also not sure why you think microformats have anything to do with 
namespaces. You still need a central authority (or two, or three) to make 
sure that everyone speaks the same language.
