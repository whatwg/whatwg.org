(I hope y'all don't mind me replying to all your e-mails out of order. I'm 
basically going down the spec one element at a time and when I come across 
one that someone has discussed in the past, I reply to those e-mails.)

But it wouldn't be, and that's rather my point. I rarely hear people 
calling out the fact that something is bold or italics or red when they 
are reading text out. I _do_ hear them say &quot;sub-&quot; this and &quot;super-&quot; that.


&gt;<i> &gt; It's not ideal, and for a better aural rendering you would use a

</I>
There's no standard rendering, but there are conventions that a UA author 
can use.


There are several use cases I can see for &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; that I consider 
to be semantic and not presentational. However, it seems very much to be 
on the fine line between the two, and I am interested in hearing of ideas 
that would more clearly move &lt;sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt; or new elements into the semantic 
camp.

Use cases:

   In french, parts of words (abbreviations, usually) are always 
   superscripted. For example, the &quot;lle&quot; in &quot;Mlle&quot;.

   In chemistry, number of atoms, atomic weights, charge, etc, are
   superscripted and subscripted.

   In variables names parts are often subscripted to indicate a specific 
   variable in a family of variables.

   In maths, superscripts are used for powers.

And of course in lots of other fields there are specific uses for them 
too. I propose to try to address as many of possible of these use cases in 
specific ways. For example, &quot;Mlle&quot; would be:

   &lt;abbr&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;lle&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;

...and variable subscripts would be:

   &lt;var&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;

I'm not sure how to deal with the chemistry case. We don't really have an 
element for anything like chemical formulas. For maths, MathML comes to 
mind, although only for the XML serialisation.

Any other cases? Any suggestions?
