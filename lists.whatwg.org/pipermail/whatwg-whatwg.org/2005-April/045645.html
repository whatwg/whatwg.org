</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with most of what you said but the problem I have with the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above is that it means almost every document will have an anonymous 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; section at the top, and I don't think that makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    If &quot;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&quot; were instead a list of hyperlinks to different 
</I>&gt;<i> sections of the document, should that list be part of the first section? 
</I>&gt;<i> If the paragraph inside the &lt;p&gt; element starts with &quot;I'd like to thank 
</I>&gt;<i> such-and-such for sticking by me while I wrote this...&quot;, is that part of 
</I>&gt;<i> the first section?
</I>
If you maintain (as I do) that the first &lt;h1&gt; is the document's title -- 
the same as the &lt;title&gt; element but without the requirement that it be 
phrased so that it can be quoted out of context -- then yes. The first 
section is the &lt;body&gt;, the &lt;body&gt; is the document's content, and the spec 
currently says:

# The first heading in a sectioning element gives the header for that 
# section.

The content at the top of the &lt;body&gt; is part of the &lt;body&gt;, and thus it is 
associated with the &lt;body&gt;'s heading.

Why would you _not_ want the navigation links, or the byline, or the 
dedication, etc, to be associated with the document's first section? It 
seems correct to me.


&gt;<i> The way I see it, if a heading starts a section, it should always be the 
</I>&gt;<i> start of a section. To do otherwise breaks consistency and may introduce 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics that are not backwards compatible in some situations.
</I>
Do you have any examples? As far as I can tell we always want the first 
heading of a section (assuming it isn't preceeded by any subsections) to 
be the heading of the section.


&gt;<i> Better to use something like &quot;[Top of the document]&quot; that denotes that 
</I>&gt;<i> describes the position of the content without naming it, and also 
</I>&gt;<i> identifies that there is content before the first heading.
</I>
But this will be happening all over the place.

  &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Fox Publications Presents:&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;The Big Newspaper&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Flood in town&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Geography&lt;/h2&gt;
     ...
    &lt;/section&gt;
   &lt;/article&gt;

The first &lt;p&gt; is clearly part of the same section as the first &lt;h1&gt;. The 
whitespace node before the two &lt;h2&gt; elements are similarly obviously part 
of their &lt;section&gt;, and the &lt;h2&gt;s clearly don't start a separate section 
that is independent of the &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; elements.


&gt;<i> &gt; Even in the case of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;body&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &lt;h1&gt;...&lt;/h1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...there's an anonymous section, because you have a whitespace text 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; node before the element. That doesn't really work for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why do outline generators need to worry about text nodes at the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning that contain only whitespace?
</I>
Because the spec is defined in terms of nodes, and introducing special 
rules for nodes that only contain space characters is a recipe for 
confusion and lack of interoperability (I'm talking from experience here).


&gt;<i> You're talking about content that won't be rendered, so for all intents 
</I>&gt;<i> and purposes, the heading is the first item in the &lt;body&gt;.
</I>
It might well be rendered (e.g. due to 'whitespace: pre').

&gt;<i> Such whitespace can simply be ignored by outliners. However, if you are 
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting that such unrendered whitespace be associated with the first 
</I>&gt;<i> section, I have no problem with that. ;)
</I>
I am suggesting that, and by extension, I'm suggesting that the first node 
(whatever it is) be associated with te first section, and that that be 
associated with the first heading.
