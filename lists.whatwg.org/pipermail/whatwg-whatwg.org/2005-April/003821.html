</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Basically:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * New features must gracefully fallback to legacy UAs: although that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Examples:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      * &lt;object&gt;&lt;/object&gt; in HTML4 allows graceful fallback, and is fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      * &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; doesn't allow good fallback, but degrades to nothing
</I>&gt;<i>        at all, so could be considered if there were no other better ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      * Switching to a different MIME type makes the file unusable in older
</I>&gt;<i>        browsers, so it would be unacceptable.
</I>
Nice.  I like this policy.  Perhaps the spec can specify a new behavior, 
and then describe how it falls back in IE across all the elements.


&gt;<i>  * Ideally, new features should be implementable using shims in WinIE, but
</I>&gt;<i>    there may be cases where that's not possible, and in those cases we're
</I>&gt;<i>    not going to avoid adding the feature just because WinIE can't do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      * a 3D context for &lt;canvas&gt; is probably not something we can
</I>&gt;<i>        realisticly expect to see implemented in IE using JS, but it's
</I>&gt;<i>        still something we've had demand for and thus something we'll
</I>&gt;<i>        likely be working on.
</I>
Yeah, shims are great but I also agree that we shouldn't let IE hold back 
progress.  A middle ground sounds like the best approach, which you have 
described.


&gt;<i> &gt; I've been hearing things lately concerning Web Applications 1.0 that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seem like they would be very difficult, impossible, or cause slow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance if emulated in IE 6.  Whats the exact relationship between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these specs and IE 6?  Will there be a baseline of support in IE 6, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; low water mark?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The relationship is that most people won't use features that don't work in
</I>&gt;<i>IE, so most features have to bear that in mind. Some people have specific
</I>&gt;<i>needs (&lt;canvas&gt; for example is something we've heard a lot of demand for
</I>&gt;<i>from people wanting to write games and the like), which they can't ever
</I>&gt;<i>expect to really have work in IE, and so for those we need to offer
</I>&gt;<i>features designed so that they can still provide alternative versions for
</I>&gt;<i>IE (i.e. fallback).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Second, what is the relationship of HTML 5 to these two specs? Who is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developing this standard?  At first glance it seems like a large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dependency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>HTML5 is the Web Apps spec. It isn't called that yet in the headings for
</I>&gt;<i>political reasons.
</I>
That makes sense.  So, Web Forms 2.0 is a response to XForms, since XForms 
isn't realistic, and Web Applications is basicly a realistic HTML 5, which 
the W3C won't or can't provide in the terms the web needs today?



&gt;<i> &gt; Third, is there a timeframe for completing these two specs and for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting actual implementations out the door?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Web Forms 2 is basically done and will be going to Call For
</I>&gt;<i>Implementations shortly.
</I>
Nice


&gt;<i>Web Apps 1 has no ETA yet. Implementations of some parts have shipped for
</I>&gt;<i>years (XMLHttpRequest), implementations of others are likely to ship soon
</I>&gt;<i>(&lt;canvas&gt;), implementations of other parts aren't likely for a long time
</I>&gt;<i>(relatively speaking).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm concerned that proprietary web app/rich web app defacto standards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will succeed faster than the WHAT-WG, like Flash and Avalon, and one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the things that attracted me to the WHAT-WG was its focus on being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real-world and pragmatic, getting it out the door rather than getting it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perfect, co-opting and using existing de-facto standards like innerHTML
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather than rolling new ivory tower ones.  Would hard deadlines on both
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specs, including deadlines for implementations, help this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree that we have to move fast. I believe the main ways to do this are
</I>&gt;<i>to (a) write text at a steady rate (as I am doing), (b) to get feedback on
</I>&gt;<i>the spec (as is happening), and (c) to stop adding new features. There is
</I>&gt;<i>one more feature I think we need to add to the spec that isn't there
</I>&gt;<i>already, namely the session stuff that people have been discussing. Other
</I>&gt;<i>than that I'm of the opinion that we have enough features for &quot;HTML5&quot; now
</I>&gt;<i>and so &quot;all&quot; that remains is fleshing the spec out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't think deadlines would help, really.
</I>
I agree; I like your approach.  Thanks for all the work and being 
responsive to people's concerns.  Thats not easy. :)

Best,
   Brad
