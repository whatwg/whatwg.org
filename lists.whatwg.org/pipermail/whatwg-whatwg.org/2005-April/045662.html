There are basically three reasons for which I'd rather not split that bit 
out. First, as you say, it would be a pain to do. Second, it wouldn't be 
very clean. While the spec _looks_ like it's neatly organised and cutting 
it out would just mean cutting out section 3, it really isn't that simple. 
The repetition model is deeply embedded in the DOM sections and the form 
submission and seeding sections. (And rightfully so -- the repetition 
model integrates with those sections so as to provide the features that 
can't be easily provided if people implement it by hand.)

The third reason is that I don't see why we need &quot;more time&quot; to discuss 
it. We've had the last two months to discuss it and there's been nothing 
really said. If it was really being discussed and some deadline was coming 
up, then I would agree -- but unless that actually happens, then I don't 
see how a delay would help.

Anyway, I've removed the &quot;open issue&quot; in the status section about whether 
the repetition model should be kept. As you pointed out, the views in 
favour of keeping it are stronger than the views suggesting it be removed.
