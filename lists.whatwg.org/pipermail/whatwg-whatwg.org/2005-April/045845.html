So there's a difference between a &quot;requirments document&quot; and a detailed 
writeup of use cases for individual features. It seems to me that two 
documents are required:
A brief end-user oriented document explaining what WF2 is and the 
general class of problems it aims to solve (i.e. adding functionality to 
web forms without breaking today's browsers). This should then introduce 
some of the most important new features (new input types, the repetition 
model, etc.) and give sample uses. The second document should be a 
longer &quot;best practice&quot; document. This would aim to explain (at a level 
appropriate to anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML/DOM) what the new 
things are and how to use the them successfully (as well as what not to 
do). The important difference between such a document and the spec is 
that it should focus on problem solving not on details needed by 
implementors. Being shorter than the spec it will be read by many more 
people.

Obviously Hixie and the WHATWG are unlikely to be able to write both of 
these documents. It would be nice if the first document were written by 
the WG and we set a wiki or somesuch up to allow a collaborative attack 
on the second.
