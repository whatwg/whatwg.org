</I>
Some feature in WF2 for which the use cases are not immediately obvious:

- the output element and the readonly attribute. Its not obvious why we 
need both, and when you should use which.
- the data-scheme in form submission (debugging has been mentioned as a 
use case, but its not obvious from the spec)
- the &quot;javascript:&quot; scheme in form submissions
- the &quot;file:&quot; scheme; post, put and delete methods
- file upload
- the form attribute. (The use case in the spec seem a little contrived)
- the _charset_ field
- step attribute on range
- step attribute on date
- list attribute on range
- changing data attribute on a select element several times during page load

Use cases are useful not just to justify features, but also as 
documentation of the intention of the spec. Often I understand a feature 
better by reading the use case, rather than by reading the precise 
specification.
