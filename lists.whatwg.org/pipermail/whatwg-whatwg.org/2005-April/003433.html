People putting small icons on their pages to indicate that the page is
valid. Also, lots of articles on the web about jumping through hoops to 
e.g. make a flash embed validate.

A conformance checker is a rubber stamp. Therefore its quite
important that a conformance checker actually checks conformance to the
spec, otherwise it is snake oil.

As HTML applications becomes more complex it becomes more important
that the markup and code is correct, but DTD-validation becomes even 
less sufficient to catch errors. A basic validity error like forgetting 
to close an &lt;b&gt;-tag will not cause the page to stop working. However, a
syntax error in the initial value of a date control *will* cause the
page to stop working as intended.

&gt;<i> now I realise it's to the

If you are referring to the paragraph about parse errors in 
&lt;<A HREF="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#handling">http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#handling</A>&gt;
I tend to agree with you. However, I dont think the requirement that 
conformance checkers should check conformance makes this worse.

The reason comparatively few authors validate their pages, is that the 
immediate practical benefit is quite small. A conformance checker would 
be much more valuable since it might catch real errors which might cause 
the page to stop working. Presumably, this added benefit will cause more 
  authors to check their pages.
