Requirements documents, sure. The WF2 spec has a whole section on 
requirements, and the WHATWG was based on a long document listing 
requirements and design criteria:

   <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html">http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html</A>

There's a far cry from that, and listing use cases for every feature. :-)


&gt;<i> One reason why I ask for this is that I've been talking to HTML

</I>
I'm not surprised. There's been no effort at making WHATWG a widely known 
effort -- it's only really been mentioned in the circles that people who 
care about standards development go in.

Ask random authors what the CSS, XHTML, or SVG working groups are doing 
and you'll get much the same replies: some people will say they're 
improving CSS, XHTML, or SVG (without knowing any more), others will say 
that there are turf wars being fought or that the groups are wasting their 
time. I don't think that's surprising. Few people have the time to really 
keep track of standards development.


&gt;<i> &gt; Most of the features have quite obvious use cases -- for example the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use case for the first feature in the Web Apps draft -- &lt;html&gt; -- is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having a predictable root element for the document or document 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fragment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so why is this important? Why are the alternatives so bad?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not talking about the &lt;html&gt; feature, I'm talking about you 
</I>&gt;<i> empathising with the reader. Remember that you might be making something 
</I>&gt;<i> that will last a long time. It's quite a responsibility.
</I>
If there are specific features that need better examples or explanatory 
text, I'm all for adding it. (Olav just sent such a list of WF2, and I'm 
going through it and adding text to WF2 to answer his questions.) But 
there is no chance that we're going to pre-emptively list the raison 
d'etre of every feature in the spec. That would take years. Many of the 
features date back to Tim's drafts in 1990. If we've lasted 15 years 
without use cases I'm sure we can continue a few more. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; I can maybe find the time to produce a document summarising the use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases for the less obvious features (probably by simply copying the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text from e-mails in the archives of this mailing list, where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features mostly originated), but I don't want to waste time doing so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for dozens of features where the use cases are obvious and nobody 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disagrees.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's fair enough. It's your choice. You're a browser developer, so 
</I>&gt;<i> you'll know how to implement it, and why you're doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a reader, I wanted to know.
</I>
I honestly don't believe that you want to read of the use case for the 
&lt;html&gt; element, the &lt;head&gt; element, the &lt;title&gt; element, and so forth, 
beyond the descriptions in the spec already.

But if you do, where is the equivalent for SVG? :-)
