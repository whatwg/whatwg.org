I agree, but I think we should wait for WF3 before adding more features. 
WF2 is a quite big enough spec as it is, we don't want to require too big 
a jump for implementors to go from WF1 (HTML4+DOM2 HTML) to WF2. Consider 
CSS2: it introduced too much compared to CSS1, and so implementors never 
fully implemented it. There is a real danger in overreaching here. Before 
we add more, we have to work out what parts of WF2 are not actually used 
enough to warrant their inclusion, IMHO.


&gt;<i> Personally I think declaring them on the FORM element might make more sense.
</I>
There is not always a &lt;form&gt; element. For example, in simple cases that 
are just use an input field for interaction with some scripted code.


&gt;<i> I know this would require quite some changes to the specification but I 
</I>&gt;<i> think it is worth it and since the specification would get another call 
</I>&gt;<i> for comments...
</I>
The idea is to have a call for comments with _no_ comments, not to keep 
changing the spec. :-) Every time we change the spec, people have to 
re-check the changes to make sure they agree with them, and if they don't, 
they comment. So every change increases the likelihood that someone will 
send a comment. And if they do, and that results in changes, we have to 
have another call for comments, etc. So just because we're going to have a 
call for comments doesn't mean it's open season for changes. :-)
