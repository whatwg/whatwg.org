 &gt; Note that the difference between &lt;title&gt; and &lt;h1&gt; is not that &lt;title&gt;
 &gt; is expected to include author information or whatever.

You personally may not expect it, but that is the inevitable and 
unsurprising effect of it being used as &quot;a context-free label to be used
to describe the page elsewhere&quot;, in the absence of simply-specified and 
-supported markup for author, publisher, parent, and so on.

 &gt; The example I gave earlier, of a Wikipedia page, shows the difference
 &gt; I meant:
 &gt;
 &gt;    &lt;title&gt;Main Page - Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia&lt;/title&gt;
 &gt;    ...
 &gt;    &lt;h1&gt;Main Page&lt;/h1&gt;

That example shows what I was talking about: &lt;title&gt; being used to 
contain non-title data -- the publisher in this case -- separated by 
arbitrary (and therefore difficult-to-parse) punctuation from the title 
itself.

 &gt; Another example:
 &gt;
 &gt;    &lt;title&gt;Introduction to the mating rituals of bees&lt;/title&gt;
 &gt;    ...
 &gt;    &lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

And that's an unrealistic example, because it's treating two definitions 
of the word &quot;Introduction&quot; as if they were the same. (As a heading by 
itself, &quot;Introduction&quot; means an introductory section; but &quot;Introduction 
to X&quot; means a basic presentation of X.) As you collect more realistic 
examples, you'll find that they follow the pattern I described.

 &gt; The point is that the &lt;title&gt; has to stand alone and represent the
 &gt; document when taken out of context, whereas the &lt;h1&gt; is the header of
 &gt; a document _in the context of the page_, i.e. when people already know
 &gt; what the basic subject area is.
 &gt;
 &gt; Thus the &lt;title&gt; is not in any sense the parent of the &lt;h1&gt; or other
 &gt; headers.

Not in Web pages designed to work with HTML 4 browsers, no. But if 
you're requiring new browsers to present some rel= values, you could 
take advantage of that to let &lt;title&gt; really be a title.

 &gt; &gt; It is a bad idea for the meaning of an element to be markedly
 &gt; &gt; different from the meaning of its name. That is likely to cause
 &gt; &gt; confusion, non-conformance, and disrespect for the spec in general.
 &gt;
 &gt; While I agree with this in general, and while I am aware of a huge
 &gt; number of cases where the HTML language faito follow ls this design
 &gt; principle, I don't see its relevance in this particular case.

The relevance is that it is exactly what you were planning to do with 
&lt;title&gt;.

 &gt; &gt; Authors have been encouraged to misuse &lt;title&gt; so far for a
 &gt; &gt; different reason: the lack of a well-defined standard for presenting
 &gt; &gt; the other information they want shown in document summaries. So a
 &gt; &gt; better idea would be to explicitly define a very limited number of
 &gt; &gt; rel= attributes (as you already plan to do) to contain the non-title
 &gt; &gt; data that authors most often put in &lt;title&gt; -- mainly author and
 &gt; &gt; publisher -- and perhaps allow the rel= attribute to be placed in
 &gt; &gt; elements other than &lt;link&gt; and &lt;a&gt;.
 &gt;
 &gt; While this sounds like a good idea in principle, I don't see how it
 &gt; affects my point (in terms of the examples above).

The point is that you can do that to avoid entrenching a mismatch 
between the meaning of the &lt;title&gt; element and the meaning of its name.
