I don't mean to be obtuse, but: they aren't to me. I guess I could imagine 
wanting declarative 3D for when you want to show someone around your 
office or something like that, but I can't say I've seen much demand for 
that, and even less integrated with HTML.

In any case, that would be something to be addressed by another 
specification, like X3D. HTML (specifically XHTML) already supports 
integrating with other namespaces.

What sky? :-) I haven't seen many applications with skies...

The biggest problem with integrating X3D and XHTML is, as far as I can 
tell, the lack of a namespace to identify X3D content. (This is similar to 
the problem preventing Docbook integration.)


&gt;<i> My thinking is that a &quot;3d&quot; context for &lt;canvas&gt; may require Javascript 
</I>&gt;<i> as complex as a 3D rendering engine built on top of OpenGL. By contrast, 
</I>&gt;<i> something like X3D would require only DOM manipulation, because the

</I>&gt;<i> particle effects, fog, et cetera, turned on and off by simply selecting 
</I>&gt;<i> an alternate stylesheet. (Well, I suppose you could do that stylesheet 
</I>&gt;<i> thing with &lt;canvas&gt; and XBL, but it wouldn't be pretty.)
</I>
I doubt it would be that simple, but sure.


If you want declarative 3D integrated into the Web browser pipeline, 
alongside the DOM, JS, XHTML, SVG, CSS, XBL, etc, I encourage you to bring 
this up with the Web3D consortium.
