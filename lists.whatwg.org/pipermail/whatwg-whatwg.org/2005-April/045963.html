Without making any judgements as to the value of the MVC model as opposed 
to other models, I just want to note that the model I described is not 
counter to the MVC model.

The MVC model, implemented in HTML, would have:

   Data model: The HTML file
   Control logic: meda-independent JS files
   User interface: The CSS files, associated XBL, and media-dependent JS

There's no reason the control logic has to be in the data model.

Now, given the above separation, and the design of HTML, the entire &quot;user 
interface&quot; layer can be lifted _and not replaced_, with the user agent 
using default values to create a basic user interface view on the fly.

However, the data model and control logic parts, while separate and 
capable of being replaced with equivalent implementations independently, 
cannot be removed altogether. The user agent would not be capable of 
inventing new data models or control logic, like it could invent new UI.

The data model and control logic's markup and JS are the &quot;content&quot;, the 
CSS, XBL, and media-dependent JS files are the &quot;style&quot;. &quot;style&quot; is 
optional, and the user should always be able to override it, while 
&quot;content&quot; is key to the application. If the user overrides the &quot;content&quot;, 
he may well end up with a broken, or at least logically different, 
application. (Of course, that's his right, IMHO. But it's not a right that 
the UA should encourage him to execise, and it is in this way that it 
differs from the &quot;style&quot; part.)
