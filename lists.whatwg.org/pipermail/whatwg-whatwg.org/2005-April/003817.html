<PRE>
My focus is actually mostly on Web Applications 1.0 rather than Web Forms 
2.0.  Responses inline.



&gt;<i>I'm not sure about WA1 as I haven't thought about it so much from an
</I>&gt;<i>implementer's point of view. What bits of it do you think are difficult
</I>&gt;<i>to implement? It seems to me that some of it does not need to be
</I>&gt;<i>implemented at all.
</I>
I'll need to think about that.  I'll have to read through the spec and 
think about what might be difficult or slow to emulate on IE.  As a start 
some of the email list discussion on changing the semantics and parsing of 
basic HTML elements and re-interpreting what they mean concerned me in 
terms of IE, since doing this might be difficult especially since you can't 
modify the prototype objects of the DOM in IE.


&gt;&gt;<i>Whats the exact relationship between these specs and IE 6?  Will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>there be a baseline of support in IE 6, a low water mark?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't think we've set a water mark but it has always been the
</I>&gt;<i>intention to produce a WF2 spec capable of being supported on IE6.
</I>
How about for Web Applications 1.0?  If there are SHOULD and MAY portions 
of the spec, would all SHOULD elements be supported in IE while all MAY 
elements would not?


&gt;&gt;<i>Second, what is the relationship of HTML 5 to these two specs? Who is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  developing this standard?  At first glance it seems like a large 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>WF2 and WA1 are components of HTML5:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Third, is there a timeframe for completing these two specs and for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>getting actual implementations out the door?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>one of the things that attracted me to the WHAT-WG was its focus on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>being real-world and pragmatic, getting it out the door rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>getting it perfect, co-opting and using existing de-facto standards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is pretty much the reason I got involved too. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Would hard deadlines on both specs, including deadlines for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>implementations, help this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As a programmer I always hated hard deadlines.
</I>
Me too, but they help, especially when you get to define them yourself. 
;)  I think it's good to a certain degree cuse its easy to get 
perfectionistic about this stuff, and a hard deadline can force you to 
accept that something won't be perfect and ship it out the door.


&gt;&gt;<i>We need this stuff yesterday; it's just too important. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Some of the developers on this list are collaborating on a WF2
</I>&gt;<i>implementation for IE5/6. It won't be ready yesterday but it will be
</I>&gt;<i>built. We'll announce more about this development when there is
</I>&gt;<i>something concrete to demonstrate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Does that satisfy your concerns?
</I>
A bit; I know that you also share an interest in real world specs that are 
&quot;good enough&quot;, but does the group and the spec writers?  Also, I'm mostly 
interested in Web Apps 1.0 so there are alot of questions still there.

Best,
   Brad
