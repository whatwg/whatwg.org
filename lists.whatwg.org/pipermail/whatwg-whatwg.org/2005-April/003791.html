First I thought you were joking, but that is actually a great idea!
VML does integrate with HTML, not just XHTML, which was one of Dave 
Hyatts major criticisms against SVG.
<A HREF="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005928">http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005928</A>

It's certainly a lot more work to implement that canvas, but if it 
became supported by other browsers than IE, it would be useful on the 
wold wide web a lot sooner than canvas or SVG. Even if Microsoft 
committed to support SVG or canvas in a future version of IE (which I 
think is unlikely), it would still take years for the implementation to 
penetrate. OTOH VML is already widely supported - it's just ignored by 
developers because it is perceived as proprietary, and because Flash has 
an even wider penetration (and better tools).
