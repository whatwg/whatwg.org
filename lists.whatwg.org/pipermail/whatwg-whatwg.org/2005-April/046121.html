    I'm not suggesting integration with HTML5. I'm perfectly happy with 
using X3D (or some other separate language, like XGL). My concern is the 
lack of analysis of how these technologies fit together. It's like 
fitting an engine to an airframe. I don't want the engine to necessarily 
be part of the airframe design, but they still have to work together, 
and you won't know where the problems are until you try fitting them 
together.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you could have it rise and set by using XBL to pull in code that moves

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What sky? :-) I haven't seen many applications with skies...
</I>
    I'll try to come up with a less game-like example next time...

    Question: Game != Application?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest problem with integrating X3D and XHTML is, as far as I can

</I>
    Good, now we're getting somewhere. Let's say X3D did have a 
namespace, like &quot;x3d&quot;. Could we use &lt;x3d:x3d&gt; or &lt;x3d:scene&gt; as the 
container/viewport?

&gt;<i> If you want declarative 3D integrated into the Web browser pipeline, 
</I>&gt;<i> alongside the DOM, JS, XHTML, SVG, CSS, XBL, etc, I encourage you to bring 
</I>&gt;<i> this up with the Web3D consortium.
</I>
    Very well. I'll also look into competing languages being developed.
