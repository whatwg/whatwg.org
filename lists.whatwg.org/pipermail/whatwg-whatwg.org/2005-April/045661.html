I'd be interested to know what your home-rolled solution would look 
like. If we can cater for your requirements then we have a flexible model.

Yes, there are already JavaScript alternatives but they are difficult to 
produce and become even more complex when trying for a cross-browser 
solution. What I like about the WF2 Repetition Model is that caters for 
99% of cases. There will always be edge cases but existing DOM methods, 
as you say, provide a means for building particular models already. In 
other words, if you feel that the Repetition Model is inadequate, please 
specify...

&gt;<i>

Ian, I thought we'd sorted this out. We had exactly the same discussion 
a few weeks back and nobody came up with any objections to the current 
model. I quite like Olav's idea to separate the Repetition Model from 
the existing WF2 spec. This would give us time to discuss it a bit more 
without impacting the rest of WF2. Maybe the Repetition Model should be 
separate anyway? Personally, if I was considering using it on a site, 
I'd prefer to print off a separate spec to read. But that's just me. I 
/do/ recognise that this is a bit of an editorial headache however... ;-)
