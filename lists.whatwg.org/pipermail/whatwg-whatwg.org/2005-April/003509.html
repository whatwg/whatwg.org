</I>
For instance:

   When you look at

      x | 1 | 2 |
     ---+---+---+
      1 | 1 | 2 |
     ---+---+---+
      2 | 2 | 4 |
     ---+---+---+

   ...it is clear that [bla bla bla].

I agree that it doesn't seem to make much sense to nest paragraphs inside 
those tables though.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm trying to work out exactly what the rules that describe the above 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually are, but I'm interested in hearing whether people agree or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disagree with my &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; examples above. I'm especially 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in what use cases I may have missed (please don't say &quot;I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think this should be allowed&quot; without giving a real-world example), 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and whether anyone thinks any of the cases I think should be allowed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You missed &lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.
</I>
Oops, yep. Added.


&gt;<i> &lt;blockcode&gt; should probably be allowed too, though it doesn't seem to be 
</I>&gt;<i> included in web apps.  Oh well, that's probably a discussion for another 
</I>&gt;<i> thread anyway, if it hasn't already been discussed (I'll search the 
</I>&gt;<i> archives later).
</I>
We haven't discussed it yet. I hadn't really thought about it but given:

   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
   &lt;blockcode&gt; ... &lt;/blockcode&gt;

...and given that the former would work in all existing UAs and the second 
wouldn't, and the former has the same semantics as the second, I don't see 
much of an advantage to the second.


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that all of this would only be relevant to XHTML content (i.e. in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an XML context), since in text/html HTML we are pretty much stuck with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the existing parsing models which do things like close &lt;p&gt; elements 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upon hitting another block-level element.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a shame no browser actually reads the DTD, this wouldn't be a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem if they did :-(.  This is one reason why HTML should be a true 
</I>&gt;<i> SGML application, and why browsers should have been built to conform.
</I>
Yeah, well. In the words of Syndrome: &quot;Too late. 15 years too late.&quot;

The spec now has block-level, structured inline-level, and strictly 
inline-level concepts. I'm not overly fond of the names (better 
suggestions welcome), but I hope it addresses your concerns.


&gt;<i> &gt;   * &lt;pre&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have CODE and other nice inline elements for this.
</I>
I'll look at &lt;pre&gt; again when it comes to specifying it. I'm not really 
happy with its semantics myself either. There is a difference between 
&lt;pre&gt; (or &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;, though; the former is much more block- 
like than the latter. I feel that's somewhat important.


&gt;<i> That is indirectly nesting P elements, a bit ugly IMHO. It also doesn't

Agreed.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;        ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why would you want a P element there?

It would probably be part of something bigger, as in:

   &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;

      &lt;ol&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ouch! Forbid this.
</I>
I probably agree with this, but I'm not 100% sure. What about &lt;pre&gt; 
blocks around e-mails:

   &lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access via the DOM also affects styling.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Also, if UAs have to parse it in the old way, what's the point?
    It's not increasing the semantics, since the UAs have to parse it the 
    old way.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/pre&gt;

...or something. Then again, that does look pretty bad.


&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Use case?
</I>
An inline example, as in:

   &lt;p&gt;
    An inline example, as in:
    &lt;pre&gt;
     &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An inline example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    ...is one use case.
   &lt;/p&gt;

...is one use case.

(Sorry.)

In text/html, yeah. I propose we don't change that for HTML5 UAs. It would 
only be in XHTML documents that you could use these new features (that and 
by direct DOM manipulation).

I'll be putting that back in due course. I want to first get the basic 
language done before starting to add the HTML vs XML exceptions. :-)

Agreed.

Cool, it seems we are in agreement then.


&gt;<i> Absolutely!  Given the incredibly broken SGML/HTML implementations that

</I>
I think we'll probably be &quot;stuck&quot; with HTML for a very long time -- at 
least as long as it takes for XML to have a variant created that has 
well-defined error handling rules other than the author-hostile &quot;abort 
processing immediately&quot;.


&gt;<i> I don't think the spec should limit nested content too much because, as 
</I>&gt;<i> is shown by the &lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; example, there are 
</I>&gt;<i> valid reasons to nest paragraphs, and possibly others we haven't thought 
</I>&gt;<i> of.
</I>
Agreed. I've made the spec not restrict the content models per se, just 
say &quot;this element can contain this category of elements&quot; and made sure the 
elements are in the right categories.


&gt;<i> Also, as history has shown, HTML4 never thought lists within paragraphs 
</I>&gt;<i> would be needed, though they are now allowed.  By placing too much 
</I>&gt;<i> restriction on the content models, we risk locking out legitimate 
</I>&gt;<i> use-cases which we haven't thought of, but which authors may find in the 
</I>&gt;<i> future.  I'm not saying we should just allow anything within anything, 
</I>&gt;<i> but we should be careful about being too restrictive.
</I>
I agree. We should be careful not to allow too much too, though -- it's 
easier to allow new things previously disallowed than remove old things 
previously allowed.

I would suggest that in that case the solution would be to avoid nesting 
elements in this way as well.

Agreed. Is option b acceptable to you?
