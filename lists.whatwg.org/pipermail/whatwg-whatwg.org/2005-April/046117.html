    Well, in situations with Javascript off, the benefits are obvious. 
There's also the potential to use XBL to apply special behavior to 
specific tags. For instance, instead of having a static Sun in the sky, 
you could have it rise and set by using XBL to pull in code that moves 
the model and lighting around.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Having said that, there are probably use cases for declarative 3D,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>dedicated markup language, just like you use SVG for 2D graphics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>My point was that I'd like to see a CDF (not the CAD kind, but the W3C

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>my lack of knowledge of XBL2 and X3D...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it wouldn't work together, it indicates a problem in the X3D spec (or 
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of an appropriate 3D declarative markup language).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> working group, though.
</I>
    I'm not saying there's a problem with X3D. I'm just trying to make 
sure there is a clear idea of how to make XHTML + X3D compound 
documents. In other words, I'm trying to find the weak link, if there is 
one, and at the moment that seems to be a lack of examples on the Internet.

&gt;&gt;<i>I already knew the HTML. I was kinda hoping to see the CSS/XBL2 part of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>that equation. That's the part I'm confused about. Does XBL2 have a CSS 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>binding property like XBL 1.0?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> XBL2 doesn't exist yet, but the idea is it will have that, yes.
</I>
    Good. I don't see nearly as strong a use case for XBL without such 
binding.

&gt;<i> I don't see people writing 3D games using a declarative format. Maybe for 
</I>&gt;<i> the models, as external files that are slurped in (just like external 
</I>&gt;<i> bitmaps are used as sprites with 2D canvas), but that's very different 
</I>&gt;<i> from having the 3D in the document.
</I>
    My thinking is that a &quot;3d&quot; context for &lt;canvas&gt; may require 
Javascript as complex as a 3D rendering engine built on top of OpenGL. 
By contrast, something like X3D would require only DOM manipulation, 
because the rendering engine would be either a plug-in or part of the 
UA. X3D could also use XBL to achieve special effects that a programmer 
would otherwise have to code into their &lt;canvas&gt;-based engine. Imagine 
LOD, particle effects, fog, et cetera, turned on and off by simply 
selecting an alternate stylesheet. (Well, I suppose you could do that 
stylesheet thing with &lt;canvas&gt; and XBL, but it wouldn't be pretty.)

&gt;&gt;<i>I mean stuff like having windows that get smaller when they're further 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>back in the Z-order. Perhaps there's a fog effect. You could have 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>various &lt;section&gt; elements rendered within a 3D environment, where the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>user looks in a specific direction or in a specific place to see the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&lt;section&gt; inside a 3D environment. Stuff like that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That'd just be up to the UA, really.
</I>
    No, I meant as in the web author implementing that with web 
standards, not the UA adding those effects to vanilla HTML5.
