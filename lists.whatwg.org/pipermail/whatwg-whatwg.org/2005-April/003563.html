That's never going to happen, just like the XHTML working group has never 
published a document with use cases for all their features. Ditto the SVG 
group, the CSS group, and so forth. Most of the features have quite 
obvious use cases -- for example the use case for the first feature in the 
Web Apps draft -- &lt;html&gt; -- is having a predictable root element for the 
document or document fragment.

I can maybe find the time to produce a document summarising the use cases 
for the less obvious features (probably by simply copying the text from 
e-mails in the archives of this mailing list, where the features mostly 
originated), but I don't want to waste time doing so for dozens of 
features where the use cases are obvious and nobody disagrees.

</I>
The two different requirements are &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; and &quot;well 
defined error handling / processing model&quot;. I expect every difference in 
the details of common features can be traced down to those two things.
