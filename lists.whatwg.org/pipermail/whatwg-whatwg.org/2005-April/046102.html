   ... the document from which the submission initiated (or, if there is a target
   attribute, the document in the appropriate frame or window) is left in place,
   and all the form elements in the document are reset ...

I think it would make more sense to say something more like:

   ... the document in the frame or window targeted by the form submission is
   left in place and all form elements in it are reset ...

This makes it clearer that the form elements are reset in the _target_ document. 
  I also think that &quot;document in the frame or window targeted by the form 
submission&quot; is clearer than &quot;the document from which the submission initiated 
(or, if there is a target attribute, the document in the appropriate frame or 
window)&quot;.  In fact, it may be even clearer to define the term &quot;target document&quot; 
up front in this section and then use it throughout (with links back to the 
definition).

Yeah....  Perhaps include a note here anyway indicating that this specification 
is not trying to define behavior of 205 responses in cases other than a form 
submission?

At this point, though, the spec looks like it would be reasonably 
straightforward to implement interoperably.

One other drive-by comment:

   Otherwise, how the UA responds to a response

would be better as:

   Otherwise, how the UA handles a response
