I guess I don't understand what you mean by &quot;fit together&quot; if you don't 
mean &quot;integrate&quot;. Any format can &quot;fit&quot; with XHTML, including PDF, Flash, 
PNG, SVG, MP3, AVI, MPEG, etc, and including X3D and its predecessor VRML, 
if integration isn't the point.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There's also the potential to use XBL to apply special behavior to

Would you really expect a game to be written with declarative 3D? I guess 
it's possible, but my impression based on talking with 3D people and game 
designers asking for Web-deployed 3D games that re-use the existing 
framework (HTML) is that they really just want access to the underlying 
APIs so that they can make their own, optimised 3D engines that do what 
_they_ want, as opposed to having a particular framework.

(Note that DOM manipulation is relatively expensive, by the way, in terms 
of runtime performance.)


&gt;<i> Question: Game != Application?
</I>
No, not at all -- games are in fact often the leading edge of 
applications, and often have even more extreme needs. Games are 
definitiely part of the WHATWG target application segment.



&gt;<i> &gt; The biggest problem with integrating X3D and XHTML is, as far as I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tell, the lack of a namespace to identify X3D content. (This is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar to the problem preventing Docbook integration.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good, now we're getting somewhere. Let's say X3D did have a namespace, 
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;x3d&quot;. Could we use &lt;x3d:x3d&gt; or &lt;x3d:scene&gt; as the 
</I>&gt;<i> container/viewport?
</I>
Assuming X3D defined how that worked, yes. (It would basically need to 
define a the contents of, and dimensions of, a 2D rectangular area that 
represented the X3D content. That would then be a replaced element and 
would fit into the CSS model directly.)


&gt;<i> &gt; If you want declarative 3D integrated into the Web browser pipeline, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alongside the DOM, JS, XHTML, SVG, CSS, XBL, etc, I encourage you to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bring this up with the Web3D consortium.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very well. I'll also look into competing languages being developed.
</I>
Cool. (Note that X3D is on the ISO standards track, which gives it a lot 
of weight.)
