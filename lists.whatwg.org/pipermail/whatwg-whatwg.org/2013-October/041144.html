Usually people accuse me of the opposite, so it's nice to hear. :-)

However, I don't think there's a huge difference in this case. The only 
difference is that with B (vs C) there's less likely to be data corruption 
(good for the user!), and more likely to be apps that break entirely 
rather than just with graphical artefacts (bad for the user). I think it 
more or less balances out. The benefit, however, is that the bugs are more 
likely to be fixed quicker with B than with C.

</I>
That would be an interesting idea. We don't currently have anything like 
this in the platform.

heycam, what do you think of such a feature? Basically, &quot;asserts&quot; in the 
APIs, which would be catchable in a debugger, but wouldn't actually block 
execution if there's no debugger around?

Agreed that this is something to consider on a case-by-case basis.

Right.

In this particular case (negative radii) it seems pretty deterministic.


My main point with the A/B/C thing was that we don't uniformly pick C. We 
do sometimes pick C where it makes sense; usually we pick either B or C.
