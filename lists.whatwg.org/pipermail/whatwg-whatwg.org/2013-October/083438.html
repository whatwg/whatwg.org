This sounds like it serializes setting up the queue, and actually drawing
the queue.  OpenGL doesn't do that: it starts sending drawing commands to
the GPU as soon as you make them, so the CPU can be setting up rendering of
the same scene while the GPU is rendering earlier commands.  It only needs
to buffer if you send commands faster than the GPU can process them (the
specific details of this are internal driver magic, but that's the gist).
 Waiting until all rendering commands have been called before starting to
render would be catastrophic for performance, since it would prevent
parallelism between the CPU and GPU.

All of that happens inside the OpenGL driver, which browsers have no
control over.
