What is that need? Can you elaborate?

If the browser crashes, it's not going to be able to send messages anyway, 
so I'm not sure that makes sense. When would the browser be able to send a 
message, but not able to properly handle unload?

</I>
The problem with that is that there'd be no real way to know what the 
owner Document is for an author. Suppose the port is sent to an iframe, 
and then just handed over from that iframe to another iframe by just 
passing it in an argument in a function, or whatnot (i.e. not transferring 
it). Now the port is nowhere near the document that &quot;owns&quot; it.

That's why there's in fact no concept of port ownership in the spec.

Also, it would force message ports to survive being GCed up to the end of 
the document's lifetime, which would essentially mean every port always 
leaks until the document is closed. This is fine for many uses of ports, 
but ports are also designed to be used as lightweight capability grants, 
which can get vended like candy.
