It's worth defining &quot;the navigation&quot; in this context.  I assume you mean 
the invocation of 
<A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#navigate">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#navigate</A> 
?  If so, I agree that this is synchronous for iframes being added to 
the DOM as things are currently specced, as well as for @src changes on 
&lt;iframe&gt;.

This algorithm then synchronously performs certain steps.  Specifically, 
checking for scroll-to-anchor and doing the scroll.  At least as far as 
I can tell.  I don't know why it keeps checking the &quot;gone async&quot; value 
in steps 11, 12, 15, since nothing in the algorithm sets it to true 
until step 16 as far as I can tell.  Is &quot;gone async&quot; some sort of 
persistent state attached to the navigation, as opposed to the local 
variable it seems to be at step 7?

&gt;<i> Perhaps step 15 on <A HREF="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#navigate">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#navigate</A> indicates the specification already mandates it to be asynchronous.

I can't tell what this specification is actually saying here, 
unfortunately.  Too much indirection.  :(

The main hard design constraint I know of here is that navigating frames 
to about:blank via appending them to the DOM should ideally not change 
which document scripts see in the frame (though it does in Gecko right 
now; as I said we consider that a bug).  Whether this is implemented via 
some sort of synchronous navigation-like thing or via navigation 
preserving the document already in the frame seems like more of an 
implementation/specification detail than an observable thing...

&gt;<i> I'm still somewhat puzzled by the fact processing the iframe attributes synchronously navigates to a new url (which itself could be async?) whereas following a hyperlink simply queues a task to navigate:

</I>
Gecko currently has that behavior: iframe @src changes start a 
navigation sync, while link clicks (and form submission) just post an 
event to start a navigation.  I wonder whether the spec simply specified 
that behavior....

The reason Gecko has the &quot;post an event&quot; behavior for link clicks is 
unclear to me.  The blame goes back to the initial revision of 
docshell/base/nsWebShell.cpp:

   1.1 &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org">kipp at netscape.com</A>&gt; 1998-07-18 14:42
   new

Not very helpful.  :(

All that said, I believe this stuff is all script-observable in the 
sense that it causes aborting of the document and whatnot.  Worth 
checking when/whether current UAs do that in the two cases.
