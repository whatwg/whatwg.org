</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; dashed rectangles will start looking different.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do we really have enough deployed content using this API that we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; already constrained? What applications are these?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not sure I follow. Are you asking who would use dashed rectangles in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; canvas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mentioned &quot;existing applications&quot;. I'm just curious which these are?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Websites using canvas?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not how stroking works in PDF, but there's no reason that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can see that it shouldn't be how stroking works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; This is how stroking works *everywhere *including canvas today.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There's three possible arguments for doing something:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - we have to because there's content depending on it, here is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    data supporting that. (That data might be &quot;the browser vendor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;    refuses to implement anything else&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - here are some logical reasons for doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - here is evidence showing that authors want us to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So far I've heard &quot;we have to do that because everyone else does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that&quot;, which isn't any of those three possible arguments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, your proposal doesn't do any of those 3 arguments either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies for not being clearer. I'm attempting to do the second: provide
</I>&gt;<i> logical reason for the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically: it allows for all three kinds of renderings. You can have
</I>&gt;<i> the behaviour you're describing by creating new paths. You can have the
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour I'm describing by using a single path. You can have the
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour Justin described by a modest addition to the path API (as he
</I>&gt;<i> described). This is better than the alternative because it's more
</I>&gt;<i> flexible. Justin also pointed out some other arguments, specifically that
</I>&gt;<i> not restarting at each subpath results in an overall more even
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of the dash density, which is aethestically pleasing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why are you breaking a path up in sections in the first place? That is not
guarenteed to look the same anyway since if you have curves, you will get
gaps.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For reason 1, I'm sure every browser would object as it doesn't follow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure browser vendors would not object purely on those grounds.
</I>&gt;<i> However, maybe I'm wrong. We can only know if they actually do or do not
</I>&gt;<i> object. (Justin did not seem to object, but maybe I misintepreted him.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For reason 2, it would be really funky that drawing 3 identical lines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (or rects or circles) would produce 3 different renditions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be really funky that if you took a line:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    ---------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...and then split it in three and moved the three parts around in an
</I>&gt;<i> animated fashion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    ---------
</I>&gt;<i>             ---------
</I>&gt;<i>                      ---------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...the dash pattern would change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Those are 3 lines; they are no longer 1 segment. (model of stroking =
drawing with a pen)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So &quot;funkyness&quot; isn't a compelling argument: it can be used to defend both
</I>&gt;<i> proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
setLineDash([30]);
rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
rect(10, 110, 100, 100);
rect(10, 210, 100, 100);
stroke();

 These rectangles should look the same.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For reason 3, authors will be surprised that identical constructs from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SVG, Core Graphics or their drawing applications would look different in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Canvas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think most authors of Web applications have never used those APIs. Where
</I>&gt;<i> is the data demonstrating this one way or the other?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've seen several applications that morph SVG data into Canvas. Adobe has
tools that create canvas drawing calls to do stroking.
Mozilla's shumway and pdf.js rely on this as well.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; We can't change the current implementations anyway because they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; already used.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If that's true, it trumps all other arguments, and we shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; trying to have other arguments. Where's the data showing this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Data that people are using dashing (which has been shipping in WebKit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the last year)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The spec still says:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Create a new path that describes the result of inflating the paths in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; path perpendicular to the direction of the path to the styles lineWidth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; width, replacing each point with the end cap necessary to satisfy the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; styles lineCap attribute as described previously and elaborated below,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and replacing each join with the join necessary to satisfy the styles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lineJoin type, as defined below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like the multipage version got out of sync. Should be fixed now.
</I>

ah. Yes, the new text is much better.
I think that works.
