They might have been generated by document.write(), it's just that they 
aren't being executed re-entrantly.


&gt;<i> Step 3 spins the event loop.  The issue is that while the tokenizer is
</I>&gt;<i> blocked other tasks can run whenever the event loop is spun and cause

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> window.setTimeout(function() {
</I>&gt;<i> document.write(&quot;Goodbye&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> }, 50);
</I>
  &lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- i'm assuming you were missing this here --&gt;

&gt;<i> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;long_loading.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
</I>
  &lt;!-- note that &lt;/link&gt; isn't valid, it is just ignored --&gt;

&gt;<i> &lt;script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> window.alert(&quot;Hello&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/script&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The algorithm in question will run when parsing the last &lt;/script&gt;. The 
</I>&gt;<i> second script can't execute until the stylesheet loads, so the spec 
</I>&gt;<i> spins the event loop until that happens.  However, if the setTimeout 
</I>&gt;<i> fires before long_loading.css loads then the document.write() call will 
</I>&gt;<i> first perform an implicit document.open(), since there is no insertion 
</I>&gt;<i> point, and blow away the entire Document.
</I>
True.


&gt;<i> This cancels any pending tasks but doesn't (as far as I can tell) cancel 
</I>&gt;<i> already started tasks.
</I>
There's only ever one already-started task. &quot;Spin the event loop&quot; stops 
the previous task, waits until a condition is met, and then queues a new 
task that is the continuation of the previous task. While the event loop 
is spinning, that original task is ended.


&gt;<i> By my reading of the spec, the rest of the steps of the algorithm should 
</I>&gt;<i> still run and the script should execute.
</I>
This appears to be true. The condition is &quot;the parser's Document has no 
style sheet that is blocking scripts and the script's &quot;ready to be 
parser-executed&quot; flag is set&quot;, which becomes true when the &lt;link&gt; element 
is removed from the document by document.open(), if nothing else.

It's an interesting case. Every other instance where &quot;spin the event loop&quot; 
can become moot is a case where the Document also stops being active, 
meaning the task that &quot;spin the event loop&quot; then adds to the task queue 
never executes (only tasks for active Documents get executed).

I considered making the &quot;spin the event loop&quot; algorithm be canceled by the 
&quot;document.open()&quot; algorithm, but that would mean that if showModalDialog() 
is called and then its document is document.open()ed, it'd never return, 
which isn't what actually happens.

So I just made the specific case of the parser spin the event loop 
returning check whether the parser in question has been aborted; if it 
has, then it just stops without running the script.


&gt;<i> I propose that instead of spinning the event loop, we instead have step 
</I>&gt;<i> 3 enter an asynchronous section if the script isn't ready to run yet 
</I>&gt;<i> which queues a task once the script is ready to run.  Since this 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm only runs at a script nesting level of zero this is a fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> minor tweak in overall behavior, but I believe it means that invoking 
</I>&gt;<i> the tokenizer can never spin the event loop which is a nice property to 
</I>&gt;<i> have.
</I>
Isn't that more or less exactly what &quot;spin the event loop&quot; does? I don't 
understand how this would solve the problem. You'd still end up resuming 
the parser after document.open() nukes the Document, leading to the script 
running and so forth.
