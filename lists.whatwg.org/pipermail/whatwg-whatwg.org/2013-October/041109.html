Could you elaborate on what confusion it adds? Pointers to Web developer 
discussion fora where this confusion is evident would be particularly 
helpful, so I can see what &quot;in the wild&quot; discussions look like. (I've seen 
confusion, but only in the context of changes that our esteemed colleagues 
at the W3C have made to their version of the language.)

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div&gt;). IMO the outline algorithm is dead and we could simplify HTML by 
</I>&gt;<i> dropping these two.
</I>
I'm not sure what it means for the outline algorithm to be dead. Documents 
do have headings of different levels; that's all the outline algorithm is, 
a way of defining what headings of different levels mean. Dropping that 
would mean having only one heading per page, which is probably not 
something that could really fly.

The difference between &lt;section&gt; and &lt;div&gt; seems pretty clear. I'm not 
sure how they can be aliases for each other. Again, any documentation on 
what you mean here would be most welcome.

</I>
I normally at this point would say &quot;well, it got implemented and that made 
it get added to the spec&quot;, but since you then added:

&gt;<i> However, I still think adding main is fully supported on principle 
</I>&gt;<i> (rather than just on browser-implementation-Hixie-veto-override) and 
</I>&gt;<i> thus I'm interested in capturing that on the wiki page so that hopefully 
</I>&gt;<i> we can learn from this analysis about adding a new element and use those 
</I>&gt;<i> lessons when considering new elements in the future.
</I>
...I guess you want more detail in my response. So:


&gt;<i> HTML5 has several new &quot;block like&quot; semantic elements (article, aside, 
</I>&gt;<i> section), including header and footer elements. There is no element to 
</I>&gt;<i> represent (and provide a hook for) for ''the'' &quot;main content&quot;.
</I>
There doesn't need to be; all content is &quot;the main content&quot; unless 
otherwise indicated.


&gt;<i> The only landmark ARIA role that lacks an equivalent semantic HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> element is also called &quot;main&quot;, and it is being used on real world 
</I>&gt;<i> websites.
</I>
There's lots of ARIA roles that don't have dedicated elements, and 
shouldn't have dedicated elements, e.g. role=application.


&gt;<i> One of the motivators was to get rid of skip links 
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/">http://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/</A>).
</I>
This use case is already handled by &lt;nav&gt;.


&gt;<i> A &lt;main&gt; element paves an already researched cowpath.
</I>
That isn't clear.


&gt;<i> The introduction of &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; is 
</I>&gt;<i> based on careful consideration based on data gathered (in 2005).
</I>
Actually, as much as I'd like to claim that was true, it's not. They were 
added based on intuition, and then I did the research, and found that my 
intuition had happened to be spot on.


&gt;<i> Even according to Hixie&#8217;s research, the class &#8220;content&#8221; ranked higher 
</I>&gt;<i> than &#8220;nav&#8221; or &#8220;header&#8221;. It would be even more obvious if you took the 
</I>&gt;<i> sum of &#8220;content&#8221;, &#8220;main&#8221; and &#8220;body&#8221; (as class names or ids).
</I>
That's what &lt;article&gt; is for.


&gt;<i> That Hixie left &lt;main&gt; out in the first place is not justified by the 
</I>&gt;<i> research presented.
</I>
Actually it was. The justification was: based on a closer inspection of 
how the popular classes are actually used, people want a way to mark up 
their content, their headings, their footers, and sometimes the body part 
of their content for stylistic reasons. Thus we provide &lt;article&gt; to mark 
up the content, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; for the headings and footers, and 
that leaves &lt;div&gt; as an emminently suitable element to mark up the &lt;body&gt;. 
There's no need for a dedicated element for the body semantically, since 
the body is, by definition, everything that's left after everything else 
has been marked up accordingly.


&gt;<i> &quot;Use of ARIA (a stop gap) should be a smell. Using it generally implies 
</I>&gt;<i> a weakness in native semantic, or, an abuse of native semantics.&quot; -David 
</I>&gt;<i> Bolter
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, role=main is the most commonly used ARIA landmark per: * 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/04/html5-accessibility-chops-real-world-aria-landmark-use/">http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/04/html5-accessibility-chops-real-world-aria-landmark-use/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> And it&#8217;s the only landmark that doesn&#8217;t have a one-to-one mapping to an 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML element name.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A main element would avoid the need to use role=&quot;main&quot;.
</I>
role=main isn't necessary in the first place if you use the other HTML 
elements correctly. ATs can programmatically determine what is not main 
content, and what is left is, by definition, main content.


&gt;<i> On various development forums and sites, there are many questions of the 
</I>&gt;<i> nature: what HTML5 element do I use for the main content of my page? 
</I>&gt;<i> E.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> * Sitepoint: 
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?855981-Main-content-area-in-HTML5-what-is-correct">http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?855981-Main-content-area-in-HTML5-what-is-correct</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> Main content area in HTML5 - what is correct ????]
</I>&gt;<i> * Stack Overflow: 
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12438300/html-5-element-for-content">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12438300/html-5-element-for-content</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTML 5 element for content?]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given that web developers are already asking these questions (and 
</I>&gt;<i> getting wildly inconsistent answers), and that they're going to author 
</I>&gt;<i> *something* for what they consider the main content, a main element 
</I>&gt;<i> would naturally provide this functionality, and alleviate a common 
</I>&gt;<i> source of confusion.
</I>
I think that with this remaining as the only use case for &lt;main&gt; should 
have led us to writing better documentation to answer the question. Adding 
an element was unnecessary for that purpose.


But in any case, &lt;main&gt; got added since it was implemented, and once 
implemented, could be made use of. (It's similar to why we have &lt;i&gt; and 
&lt;cite&gt; and &lt;small&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; and many other elements that I probably 
wouldn't think had sufficient justification if we were adding them now, 
but since they're implemented, we might as well make use of them.)

I don't think it makes much sense for &lt;main&gt; to be a sectioning element. 
It's used to mark the part of a sectioning element that's the &quot;body&quot;, so 
pretty much by definition it can't be a section as well.


&gt;<i> 2. Making &lt;main&gt; being usable multiple times in a document, so we also

The spec does not limit &lt;main&gt; to being used only once.

An example of something that would be a legitimate untitled &lt;article&gt; 
would be the calculator widget in Apple's Dashboard product. You could 
easily imagine the widgets on UStart.org, Protopage.com, my msn, my 
Yahoo!, etc, not having captions -- actually I was somewhat surprised at 
how many of the widgets actually did have headings. A comic strip archive 
page showing many comics back to back might have each comic in a separate 
&lt;article&gt; without necessarily needing a heading for each one.

Basically, any time you have something syndicatable, it might make sense 
in an &lt;article&gt;. Not everything that's syndicated has an explicit heading.

An example of an untitled &lt;section&gt; would be a slide in a slide deck, or a 
chapter in a picture book.

Yeah, that's a good example too. The comments on reddit could each be an 
&lt;article&gt;, for instance. Tweets on twitter, similarly. Cards in modern 
card UIs might be &lt;article&gt; or &lt;section&gt; elements without headings.

The &quot;outline&quot; of a document is just the semantic relationship between 
sections, headings, and other content in a page.

Indeed. (The extra empty space or &quot;***&quot; is usually better mapped to &lt;hr&gt; 
than to &lt;section&gt;, but it's certainly possible to use either in practice.)

Yeah. Or the outline could never be shown but could still be used in 
deciding what &quot;shift + page up&quot; should do, for instance.

Given the number of examples that are listed above that are legitimately 
sections or syndicatable articles, yet don't have headings, that seems 
unnecessarily strict.


&gt;<i> Because blog comments are coded using &lt;article&gt;s, at least their &quot;author 
</I>&gt;<i> name&quot;s should be contained within &lt;h1&gt;s so that in the document outline 
</I>&gt;<i> they are presented clearly. For example, &lt;h1&gt;Mike Smith says&lt;/h1&gt;, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h1&gt;Commenter: Mike Smith&lt;/h1&gt;, or just &lt;h1&gt;Mike Smith&lt;/h1&gt;.
</I>
It's not really clear to me that anyone is going to be navigating a 
comments section using a document outline. But in any case, it seems like 
it would be fine for a UA that does expose an outline to just replace the 
missing heading with a fragment of the content.


&gt;<i> Every section of a novel needs a heading, too. Otherwise in the document 
</I>&gt;<i> outline we will see a bunch of &quot;Untitled Section&quot;s.
</I>
Or &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;, &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; etc, if the UA takes the first 
few words to describe the section.

The same as markup ever provides. It describes the meaning, provides 
styling hooks, and so forth.


&gt;<i> why not section or list?
</I>
&lt;article&gt; is a kind of section that is syndicatable and self-contained. 
That's what a comment is. &lt;section&gt; and &lt;li&gt; aren't as good a fit.

Having said that, if an author wanted to describe their blog comments 
using &lt;section&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;/&lt;li&gt;, it would still work.


&gt;<i> who are the consumers of the semantics?
</I>
Generally the authors themselves, for styling; maybe future ATs, search 
engines, and the like, could also make use of the semantics, if they are 
reliable used. But generally most semantics are actually only used by the 
authors themselves.

(I mean, you could ask the same questions of &lt;ol&gt;/&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;em&gt; vs 
&lt;strong&gt; vs &lt;i&gt; vs &lt;b&gt;, etc.)

When article elements are nested, the inner article elements represent 
articles that are in principle related to the contents of the outer 
article. That's the meaning of the nesting, per the spec.

They do have markup of their own: nested &lt;article&gt;s.

It's the exact same structure, the exact same information can be conveyed. 
That's just a matter for implementors. Since &lt;ol&gt; is decades old and

It's based on how people mark up their documents. It's common for authors 
to mark up the body part of their articles or sections with a class=main 
or class=content or similar, for styling purposes. The &lt;main&gt; element is 
defined to be a suitable replacement for that.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/html&gt;
</I>
Right.

(Actually, role=main is allowed to be repeated as well, according to the 
ARIA spec.)


&gt;<i> The first header (body &gt; header) hopefully contains the page main header 
</I>&gt;<i> (perhaps blog title and slogan, maybe site navigation in &lt;nav&gt;) and 
</I>&gt;<i> within the first &lt;main&gt; (body &gt; main) is a list of articles (perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> blog entries?) where each article has its own header (article &gt; header), 
</I>&gt;<i> main part (article &gt; main) and the footer (article &gt; footer). (Note that 
</I>&gt;<i> the selectors that I used within the parentheses are generic and should 
</I>&gt;<i> work equally well on any page that uses &lt;main&gt; element.)
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> In the real world, the main part pretty much always requires some 
</I>&gt;<i> container (usually for styling and scripting) anyway so better 
</I>&gt;<i> standardize &lt;main&gt; for that, IMHO. I know Ian does/did not agree because 
</I>&gt;<i> in theory that is not needed because the main part is everything minus 
</I>&gt;<i> header minus footer. However, it turns out that neither CSS or JS can 
</I>&gt;<i> handle that really well. In the end, the WHATWG was supposed to be about 
</I>&gt;<i> real world usage vs. theoretical correctness and this is one example of 
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
Well, I don't think &lt;main&gt; really gets us anything &lt;div class=main&gt; didn't 
get us, since the semantics are redundant (the main content is everything 
not in an element defined to not be main content, like &lt;header&gt; or 
&lt;aside&gt;), but since browsers have implemented &lt;main&gt;, it makes sense to 
use it for the purpose you describe, right.


&gt;<i> If the content is authored this way, UA could provide a navigation aid 
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;skip to the start of the next piece of content&quot; instead of the 
</I>&gt;<i> current &quot;global skip to the content&quot; implementation allowed by id=&quot;main&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> or role=&quot;main&quot; which would be usually the same as end of 
</I>&gt;<i> html&gt;body&gt;header.
</I>
That's possible without &lt;main&gt; too, but yes.

Yeah, that's a good example. There's plenty of others, e.g. a headshot in 
a bio, or a table that has its own caption (or no caption). Basically any 
time that you have a figure that's part of the main content, but doesn't 
have an explicit caption. Typically, this would be anything that's 
referenced by the main content and yet floated to the side, but where it 
is uniquely identifiable, e.g. &quot;the table&quot;, &quot;the code listing&quot;, &quot;the 
diagram&quot;, or whatnot, if there's just the one.

Right. Paragraphs are in-flow and come after their previous paragraph and

&lt;figure&gt; is more like &lt;aside&gt;, except that it's part of the main content.

The above is semantically equivalent the case of the &lt;div&gt; replaced by the 
&lt;p&gt; (since &lt;div&gt; has no meaning, and there's an implied paragraph between 
the other paragraphs, per the spec). So it would be more dubious that the 
&quot;arial&quot; text can be moved around at will.

However, yes, you're right, you could do it this way if you wanted.

You could also replace all the &lt;p&gt;s with &lt;div&gt;s, and all the &lt;section&gt;s 
with &lt;div&gt;s, and style everything using classes instead. It'd be less 
pretty, might be harder to maintain, probably wouldn't be quite as easy 
for software to make head or tails out of it (though sprinkling some ARIA 
around might help with that), but it'd still be fine HTML.


&gt;<i> so if not referenced somewhere, they should not be in a figure?
</I>
It doesn't have to be referenced explicitly. It's just a figure. But they 
typically are.

Arguably, the font figures in the example above aren't really explicitly 
referenced -- you wouldn't know they were missing if you removed them 
entirely -- but they're still figures.

Right. The idea with the examples here is to show a wide variety of valid 
ways to use the element, so as to not imply from the examples that any 
one specific technique is the only valid one.

At the end of the day, only the normative text (as defined by the word 
&quot;must&quot;, and indirectly by &quot;represents&quot;) matters.


&gt;<i> This leaves us with the question at hand: if we see a &lt;figure&gt; element, 
</I>&gt;<i> can we expect to find a part of the document from which it is 
</I>&gt;<i> referenced? Consider the following scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One is reading an online newspaper article.  The article references 
</I>&gt;<i> Figure 1, located at the end of the article (and near the bottom of the 
</I>&gt;<i> page) due to readability constraints.  We look at the end of the 
</I>&gt;<i> article, and see a figure with a caption &quot;Figure 1&quot;.  The article then 
</I>&gt;<i> references &quot;Figure 2&quot;, so we look at the end of the article and see a 
</I>&gt;<i> figure with a caption, &quot;Figure 2&quot;.  We arrive at the end of the article 
</I>&gt;<i> and see another figure with a caption, &quot;Figure 3&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the above scenario, Figure 3 is unreferenced.  The first instinct 
</I>&gt;<i> when looking at an unreferenced figure (as used in the scenario) is to 
</I>&gt;<i> examine the figure to attempt to establish a context for it.  Whether or 
</I>&gt;<i> not context is established, the second instinct is almost invariably to 
</I>&gt;<i> go back to the part of the article after Figure 2 was referenced in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to find out where we missed the reference to Figure 3.  A third, 
</I>&gt;<i> slightly lesser instinct may even prompt a review of the entire article 
</I>&gt;<i> in an effort to find the missing reference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible that the author of the fabled online newspaper article 
</I>&gt;<i> needed to use a visible caption, and could not find a better element for 
</I>&gt;<i> the job than &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt;.  It is not obvious whether the 
</I>&gt;<i> article was edited incorrectly, whether there was a printing error, or 
</I>&gt;<i> whether the unreferenced figure was intended to stand alone.
</I>
This problem can occur with or without &lt;figure&gt;, of course.

Nothing in HTML forces the author to give a caption.


&gt;<i> I propose that unreferenced figures set unreasonable expectation, as 
</I>&gt;<i> just described, and that either
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) more generic grouping content should be used to group unreferenced data
</I>&gt;<i> with captions, or
</I>&gt;<i> 2) a new element be created similar to &lt;label&gt; with an attribute similar to
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;for&quot; attribute that is not required to be located within a user
</I>&gt;<i> interface such as form, or
</I>&gt;<i> 3) a new set of elements similar to &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; be created to
</I>&gt;<i> group unreferenced data.
</I>
I don't really see why &lt;figure&gt; doesn't already handle this case. Nothing 
is forcing the author to label the figure &quot;Figure 3&quot; or to not say &quot;Figure 
3. This figure (not referenced in the article) shows...&quot;.

These are biased towards home pages, which are likely to use implicit 
references, not explicit references. You'd have to look at deep pages to 
see how &lt;figure&gt; was used on those, too.

In any case, the spec doesn't say it has to be an explicit reference. Take 
the last example above. Each &lt;figure&gt; is actually implicitly referenced by 
the text immediately following it. That's exactly the kind of thing the 
element is intended for.

(Also, note that the spec is encouraging best-practice behaviour, not 
describing actual behaviour. If we described actual authoring behaviour, 
the spec could do away with pretty much any content model or syntax 
restrictions, for example...)

Sure. The main thing that it adds is an easy hook for styling. (Notice 
that the pages cited above tend to apply styles to the &lt;figure&gt;.)


&gt;<i> The WHATWG HTML specification [1] currently says
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If a figure element is referenced by its relative position, e.g. &quot;in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the photograph above&quot; or &quot;as the next figure shows&quot;, then moving the

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;article&gt; element, though that seems to be the largest use.
</I>
Well we have to be careful about assuming that the uses above are 
representative, since they're so strongly biased towards home pages. But 
it's true that there was no example of an implicit &lt;figure&gt; in an 
&lt;article&gt;. I tweaked the examples accordingly.


&gt;<i> One idea is that rather than a figure being referenced explicitly, 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it should be assumed that if it is in an grouping element, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> referenced implicitly as being related to that grouping element's

</I>
The spec doesn't actually say that there has to be an explicit reference. 
Only that there can be a reference (which could be implicit).


&gt;<i> Unfortunately, using &lt;figure&gt; as a container for an unreferenced image 
</I>&gt;<i> thumbnail related to &lt;article&gt; content makes us lose the definition that 
</I>&gt;<i> the &lt;figure&gt; can be removed from the visual flow and still retain 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning in and of itself, since such usage then prevents the figure from 
</I>&gt;<i> being referenced at all, even if desired.
</I>
I disagree with the premise here. The thumbnail still makes sense on its 
own, at least to the same extent as any diagram in a document. I'm not 
sure what you mean by &quot;prevents the figure from being referenced at all&quot;.


&gt;<i> Another idea is that &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; should merely be used as

</I>
There's a difference between a sidebar and a figure. If the spec's 
descriptions are failing to distinguish them, that's unfortunate. There's 
quite a bit of text in the spec that attempts to distinguish them. Can you 
elaborate on how that text is insufficient?
