</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; some incorrect assumptions. For instance, the dashes are calculated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; over the total lenght of all subpaths, but each subpath should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; treated separately.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That's intentional, otherwise if you stroke an already-dashed line,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you clarify what you mean by &quot;an already-dashed line&quot;.  Do you mean

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, can you describe the weird results?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean that if you have a line that consists of a series of dashes, and

</I>&gt;<i>   c.moveTo(100,100);
</I>&gt;<i>   c.lineTo(120,100);

</I>&gt;<i>   c.lineTo(180,100);
</I>&gt;<i>   c.moveTo(190,100);
</I>&gt;<i>   c.lineTo(210,100);
</I>&gt;<i>   c.stroke();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You get something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    -- -- -- -   -- -- -- -   -- -- -- -   -- -- -- -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...instead of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    -- -- -- -   - -- -- --    -- -- --    -- -- -- -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...which would look more balanced.

That's debatable :-)
To me, the first one looks more balanced.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I did not see a reference to curves and how they should be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on what text in the spec you think doesn't handle

</I>

I think that was addressed with your changes that describe that a stroke is
like sweeping a line.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am curious as to the motivation for creating a new dashing model
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead of adopting an existing model that developers and designers are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all familiar with. Is the new model addressing specific problems that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the well know dashing model cannot solve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes; it's addressing the problems that have been discussed in this thread
</I>&gt;<i> several times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - the dash density is biased to the start of the pattern if you reset
</I>&gt;<i>    with each subpath, which is aesthetically displeasing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - if the pattern resets at each subpath, then you can't take a dashed
</I>&gt;<i>    path and then split it arbitrarily, moving subparts of the path,
</I>&gt;<i>    without the pattern suddenly shifting when the path is &quot;cut&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we are going to have per-point control over this behaviour (as
</I>&gt;<i> suggested in the aforementioned bug), then I don't mind so much what the
</I>&gt;<i> default behaviour is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Introducing a new dashing model adds complexity to conversions from one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; graphics model to another, e.g., when printing a web page or saving it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as PDF, converting from PDF to HTML or exporting to HTML from current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WYSIWYG drawing/design programs.  For example, PDF and SVG both have an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operator to stroke and fill a path.  Compound paths, (e.g. a donut with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an inner and outer circle), that are both stroked and fill would need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be duplicated and broken up into two paths to be drawn correctly into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this model - assuming they are created in an application/format that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works with the PDF/SVG stroking model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally, I think that having dashes continue across sub paths
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduces uncertainty in the graphic design. Consider a designer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; editing a sub-path on a dashed path with multiple sub paths. Changing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the length of one sub-path will affect the dashing on the other sub
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paths. This is really counter intuitive to what is expected. Also, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think that from a designers perspective it will be harder to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desired look on compound paths (unless you like adding numbers as you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work). I think the placement of the dash on start and end points of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paths and sub paths is the critical design element and continuing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dashing across sub paths defeats this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are good arguments for the reset behaviour. I don't see them as
</I>&gt;<i> particularly more or less compelling than the arguments above. If we are
</I>&gt;<i> going to eventually allow both behaviours, it's kind of moot; all that
</I>&gt;<i> matters then is the default.
</I>

Well, I believe that the default should be what all graphical libraries
have implemented and what is expected by graphical applications and most
authors.
We can provide an optional argument to implement your proposal.


&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, I think the join and other effects suggested as motivations for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the new dashing model are higher level and should be styles settings or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar where the underlying implementation uses the basic stroking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apparatus to achieve the desired look.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what this means.
</I>

I think he means that dashing happens first and basically chops up the path
in sections. Those sections are then treated as normal subpaths (except we
have to special case zero length segments since they need to align to the
direction of the path)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Here's my concrete use case. I have a dashed line. I want the user to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; click two points on it, and then I want to split the line at those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; points and move the three segements independently. I do not want the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dashes to change when I go from there being one line to there being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; three.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; How do I get this effect with the mechanism you describe?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You use dashOffset and stroke multiple times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is that a sufficient answer for my case but not yours? It seems it

Sure. I thought at this point we were debating how we could get your
behavior with the existing model.

SVG doesn't define anything wrt dashing. They just list the parameter.
I'm unsure what's missing for line caps but we should call out what happens
to 0 length dash patterns [0 2]


&gt;<i> &gt; 2) the way of handling dash sequences with an odd number of elements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (concatenate the sequence onto itself to make it even): this was easy to

No, just return [3] as what was passed in.
