But don't forget that this is a cost to authors, who now have to .close()
the object.  If they forget, or don't know they need to do that, or miss
some code paths, then there are no blatant side-effects--things are just
mysteriously slower, and probably with more of an effect in some
implementations than others (which is never good).  With attachToCanvas,
this can't happen.

 and it seems like turning this into a fast buffer swap under the hood

To me it seems obviously more complicated, but I guess I'll leave that
evaluation to implementors.


&gt;<i>  Also, with the &quot;transferToImageBuffer&quot; approach, if you want to render
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from a worker into multiple canvases in the UI thread, you have to post
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those ImageBuffers over to the main thread each frame, which has the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (potential) synchronization issues as the transferDrawingBufferToCanvas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are those issues? You can do a single postMessage passing a complete
</I>&gt;<i> set of ImageBItmaps.

I don't know the answer to this; my feeling is that posting to the UI
thread and scripts in the UI thread may or may not have
(performance/smoothness) issues, but doing it all in the worker avoids any
potential for this issue.

</I>
I don't see why.  You just use double-buffering as always: the worker draws
to the backbuffer, then the drawing buffer (back-buffer) and the buffer
being displayed (front-buffer) are flipped and you start over.   I don't
think there's any difference in this between native OpenGL, today-WebGL,
and WorkerCanvas-WebGL.

(I realize I'm looking at this from a WebGL-biased perspective, which
clears the buffer between presentations unless you tell it not to.  This is
specifically to allow this sort of fast buffer flipping.  2d canvas doesn't
do that, so to allow copy-free display it'd need a flag like WebGL's
preserveDrawingBuffer = false.  This applies to any API trying to get
buffer flipping out of 2d canvas, though--something has to be added or
changed.  We don't need to address this here.)
