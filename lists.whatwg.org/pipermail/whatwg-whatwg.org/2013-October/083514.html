</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It occurs to me that all of the proposals here does expose some amount

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; when the other side crashes exposes GC behavior. If GC happens to run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; before the crash and then collect the MessageChannel ports, then no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; channel exists at the time of crash, and thus no event is sent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However if the GC runs later, or if it doesn't successfully collect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the MessageChannel ports, then the &quot;channeldropped&quot; event does fire.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure if I understand this.  If the MessagePort exists on the side
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is interested to handle the event, then it can't be GCed on the
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side either, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought the proposal was to not fire &quot;channeldropped&quot; when the
</I>&gt;<i> channel is GCed. Thus allowing channels with both &quot;message&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;channeldropped&quot; event listeners on either side to still be GCed. Is
</I>&gt;<i> that correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that's correct.


&gt;<i> If so, that exposes GC behavior. If at some point both pages that hold
</I>&gt;<i> on to an endpoint of a message channel drop their references the
</I>&gt;<i> channel can get GCed. If it is GCed no events fire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However if the page holding on to either port crashes before the GC
</I>&gt;<i> happens, then the &quot;channeldropped&quot; event is fired on the other port.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence the timing of the GC affects whether &quot;channeldropped&quot; is fired.
</I>&gt;<i> Hence GC behavior is exposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, I see the problem now.


&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; That's not to say that this solution wouldn't work. Exposing some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; amount of GC behavior might be ok. But it does mean that we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have a realistic bar as we discuss expanding the event to more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; situations than just process crashes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One solution which I think would never expose GC behavior is to simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have a property on the MessagePort which indicates if the owner of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; other side has been killed or navigated away from. No event would fire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; as that property changes value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Since it's a property, it can only be read if a reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; MessagePort is being held. As long as such a reference exists neither
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; side of the MessageChannel can be GCed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exposing this state as a property will make people who have use cases
</I>&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as &quot;Update the UI if this other tab/page/app/etc is killed&quot; poll the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attribute, which seems non-ideal to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a way to simultaneously fulfill all of the following
</I>&gt;<i> constraints:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Don't expose GC.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Provide a callback when the other side crashes or lives in a thread
</I>&gt;<i> that dies.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Enable GC of channels where neither side referenced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I think might work is to say that as long as a &quot;channeldropped&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> event listener is registered with a port, that is equivalent to
</I>&gt;<i> holding a strong reference to the port. I.e. that prevents the channel
</I>&gt;<i> from being GCed. Even if no references are held to either port.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, we'd give up 3, but only when 2 is actively used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then define that &quot;channeldropped&quot; is fired on a port whenever the
</I>&gt;<i> other side is killed due to either living in a process that crashes,
</I>&gt;<i> or living in a thread that is closed or terminated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would also need to define that the &quot;channeldropped&quot; event is never
</I>&gt;<i> fired on a port if that port's *owning* window has been navigated away
</I>&gt;<i> from. Otherwise we could *never* GC a channel between two windows that
</I>&gt;<i> has &quot;channeldropped&quot; registered on either side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This sounds good to me.


&gt;<i> So the expectation is that a caller should only register a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;channeldropped&quot; event if it's actively waiting for a response from
</I>&gt;<i> that thread. It's not something that you should register when creating
</I>&gt;<i> the port and then never unregister. Having a &quot;channeldropped&quot; event
</I>&gt;<i> listener registered can cause a whole worker thread to be kept alive
</I>&gt;<i> longer than it otherwise would.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> We could further define that &quot;channeldropped&quot; is fired when the owner
</I>&gt;<i> of the *other side* is navigated away from. This would mean that
</I>&gt;<i> events can be received even after a &quot;channeldropped&quot; event has been
</I>&gt;<i> fired since other windows could still hold a reference to the port and
</I>&gt;<i> send messages through it. However it would allow us to release the
</I>&gt;<i> strong reference that the &quot;channeldropped&quot; event listener implicitly
</I>&gt;<i> creates as soon as either side is navigated away from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But what if the page is navigated back to?  I think this implies that
having fired a &quot;channeldropped&quot; event because of this reason means that the
UA needs to make it impossible to navigate back to the same window, which
means disabling optimizations such as Gecko's back-forward cache, which
sucks.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, having a setTimeout(0) loop which polls the attribute would open
</I>&gt;<i> us to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the exact same risks as the event would, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you mean? Which risks in particular are you referring to?
</I>

I was talking about GC observabiity, but I think I was wrong since the
attribute that you were proposing could not be queried if you lost the
reference to it from js...
