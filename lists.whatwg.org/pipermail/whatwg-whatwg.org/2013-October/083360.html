</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can you tell me what is wrong with line caps on dashes? Is that your
proposal to not have dashes on join and endcaps?


&gt;<i> 2) the way of handling dash sequences with an odd number of elements
</I>&gt;<i> (concatenate the sequence onto itself to make it even): this was easy to
</I>&gt;<i> resolve, although I have reservations about this. I think it may feel
</I>&gt;<i> unnatural to many graphics designers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that looked very odd to me too. Usually when you set an array, you get
the same array values back.
To bad that it already landed in 3 browsers...


&gt;<i> 3) The method of mapping the dash pattern to the path: I suspected this
</I>&gt;<i> might be a problem, but I didn't really pay much attention to it until this
</I>&gt;<i> thread started.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Inflating paths: this did not worry me at all. I was confident that any
</I>&gt;<i> differences in results would be negligible and decided not to even
</I>&gt;<i> investigate unless someone reported a bug.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True. It didn't really matter for now. However, if we allow getting the
stroke outlines in the future, we needed a better description how stroking
is done.
The current wording of &quot;Sweeping a line&quot; describes how you create a stroke
region and not an &quot;inflated path&quot;.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like some canvas conformance tests for this behavior with proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> renders to help implementers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and again let me add an implementer's perspective. I do not intend to
</I>&gt;<i> fully implement the algorithm that is in the spec, I only intend to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate existing stroking algorithms that are provided by graphics APIs.
</I>&gt;<i>  As Ian stated earlier, a formal textual description of the stroking
</I>&gt;<i> process is important because of the normative nature of the specification.
</I>&gt;<i> Understood. But having only that to work with is quite challenging because
</I>&gt;<i> it means figuring out the gaps between the canvas spec and the graphics
</I>&gt;<i> API's implementation, then finding ways map one to the other.  So far I
</I>&gt;<i> have mostly (if not only) written tests for cases that I identified as
</I>&gt;<i> issues needing to be resolved, I have not gone through the exercise of
</I>&gt;<i> rigorously designing a series of tests that covers all the branches in the
</I>&gt;<i> spec'ed algorithm and all the special cases, and combinations thereof. That
</I>&gt;<i> would be useful, but it's a big chunk of work.
