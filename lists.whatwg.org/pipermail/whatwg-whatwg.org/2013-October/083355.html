<PRE>Le 13/10/2013 23:33, Robert O'Callahan a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                bool commit();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Boolean as return value for success? :-s
</I>&gt;<i>     A promise instead maybe? throw instead of false at least?
</I>&gt;<i>     In any case, it looks like commit could be a long operation (tell
</I>&gt;<i>     me if I'm wrong here. Do you have numbers on how long it
</I>&gt;<i>     takes/would take?), having it async sounds reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;commit&quot; does not need to be async, it doesn't have to block in practice.
</I>Just so that I better understand how commit works, what happens in this 
case:

    // draw things
   wc.commit();
   // draw other things
   wc.commit();

?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I feel fairly strongly against the run-to-completion violation as
</I>&gt;<i>     it's a foundation of how JavaScript works, how people reason about
</I>&gt;<i>     programs. Also, TC39 is working hard to close the gap between what
</I>&gt;<i>     can be expressed in pure ECMAScript and what the web platform does
</I>&gt;<i>     express, it'd be inappropriate to add things that widen this gap
</I>&gt;<i>     in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I don't see this as a violation of run-to-completion 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics. The important thing is that the dimensions of the 
</I>&gt;<i> WorkerCanvas (and any other state observable by the worker) do not 
</I>&gt;<i> change except during the call to commit(). Effectively commit() itself 
</I>&gt;<i> performs the change.
</I>Hmm... Interesting point of view...
That's the only way to learn that the dimensions have changed? Via 
commit() throwing an error/returning false? It feels very ad-hoc. It 
doesn't seem to scale very well to other reasons why commit() might fail.
I also imagine that the normal pattern will be &quot;draw then commit&quot;, so it 
means that you always spend efforts drawing without ever knowing if what 
you're drawing is ever going to end up on screen; which feels like a 
waste of resources.

&gt;<i> Of course it's OK for DOM API implementations to change state :-).
</I>I don't understand what you mean here.

What happens to WorkerCanvas in the canvas element is removed from the 
document or display:hidden-ed?
