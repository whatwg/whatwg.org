</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you elaborate? What would break?

Do we really have enough deployed content using this API that we are 
already constrained? What applications are these?


&gt;<i> &gt; It's not how stroking works in PDF, but there's no reason that I can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see that it shouldn't be how stroking works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is how stroking works *everywhere *including canvas today.
</I>
There's three possible arguments for doing something:

 - we have to because there's content depending on it, here is the
   data supporting that. (That data might be &quot;the browser vendor 
   refuses to implement anything else&quot;.)

 - here are some logical reasons for doing it.

 - here is evidence showing that authors want us to do it.

So far I've heard &quot;we have to do that because everyone else does that&quot;, 
which isn't any of those three possible arguments.


&gt;<i> We can't change the current implementations anyway because they are 
</I>&gt;<i> already used.
</I>
If that's true, it trumps all other arguments, and we shouldn't be trying 
to have other arguments. Where's the data showing this?


&gt;<i> &gt; Why is approximating a problem? It's not like we're doing pure math 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paths here, they're all approximated at the end of the day. The spec 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't specify how you implement it exactly, it just requires that we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have consistent results that, within the limitations of the hardware 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e.g. only 1 pixel for every 10 microns) are indistinguishable from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the theoretical results.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this is why drawings/pictures of what the stroke should look like are 
</I>&gt;<i> more important.
</I>
You can't write normative specifications with sample drawings. Or at 
least, if you can, I certainly haven't seen it done before. Spec by 
example is not the level of quality that we expect at the WHATWG.


&gt;<i> Saying &quot;inflate the path perpendicular&quot; is not good enough since it 
</I>&gt;<i> could mean anything.
</I>
That's why the spec no longer says that, as noted in my e-mail from 
yesterday.


&gt;<i> You either write out the math (which no spec has done afaik) or you give 
</I>&gt;<i> examples (like 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_paths/dq_paths.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_paths/dq_paths.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>
Or you can give prose that describes it unambiguously, which I believe is 
what the spec does now.
