</I>&gt;<i>                        bool commit();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Boolean as return value for success? :-s
</I>&gt;<i>             A promise instead maybe? throw instead of false at least?
</I>&gt;<i>             In any case, it looks like commit could be a long
</I>&gt;<i>         operation (tell
</I>&gt;<i>             me if I'm wrong here. Do you have numbers on how long it
</I>&gt;<i>             takes/would take?), having it async sounds reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;commit&quot; does not need to be async, it doesn't have to block
</I>&gt;<i>         in practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Just so that I better understand how commit works, what happens in
</I>&gt;<i>     this case:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        // draw things
</I>&gt;<i>       wc.commit();
</I>&gt;<i>       // draw other things
</I>&gt;<i>       wc.commit();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two frames get queued as eligible for presentation. Which ones reach 
</I>&gt;<i> the screen is unspecified of course.
</I>Is there a way to know if/when a frame reaches the screen? Wouldn't this 
information be useful at least to know when it's safe to commit again?

Not directly related, but I imagine requestAnimationFrame doesn't work 
in a worker. How can a script know when to stop drawing on a given canvas?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Personally I don't see this as a violation of
</I>&gt;<i>         run-to-completion semantics. The important thing is that the
</I>&gt;<i>         dimensions of the WorkerCanvas (and any other state observable
</I>&gt;<i>         by the worker) do not change except during the call to
</I>&gt;<i>         commit(). Effectively commit() itself performs the change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Hmm... Interesting point of view...
</I>&gt;<i>     That's the only way to learn that the dimensions have changed? Via
</I>&gt;<i>     commit() throwing an error/returning false? It feels very ad-hoc.
</I>&gt;<i>     It doesn't seem to scale very well to other reasons why commit()
</I>&gt;<i>     might fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What other reasons are there?
</I>Won't there ever be?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I also imagine that the normal pattern will be &quot;draw then commit&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     so it means that you always spend efforts drawing without ever
</I>&gt;<i>     knowing if what you're drawing is ever going to end up on screen;
</I>&gt;<i>     which feels like a waste of resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see this as being a problem, or at least no more of a problem 
</I>&gt;<i> than it already is.
</I>What do you mean by &quot;than it already is&quot;? Currently, if one calls a 
method on a context2d, the result is guaranteed to appear on screen 
eventually, no? It never happens that you start drawing and all of it 
gets dropped because of external conditions, right?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Of course it's OK for DOM API implementations to change state :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't understand what you mean here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's OK for calling DOM methods to change state visible to script.
</I>That's not the problem. The semantics of commit is &quot;send this frame and 
maybe change dimensions&quot;. It's an awkward semantics mixing largely 
unrelated things.
It's like if the send() method of a worker's XHR didn't work when the 
&lt;base&gt; changed in the parent page. It's also very dependent on timing 
and may cause bugs that are very hard to debug.
