Robert, please don't remove those APIs from your proposal. They're
needed in order to address known use cases, and splitting them off
will make it difficult to understand how they interact with
WorkerCanvas later.

I would like to suggest changing the 'srcObject' property on
HTMLImageElement into some sort of method taking ImageBitmap as
argument. If an ImageBitmap had been previously set against the
HTMLImageElement, the method would automatically call 'close()'
against it. Fundamentally there should be some easy way to repeatedly
update the HTMLImageElement without having to query its previous
ImageBitmap and call close() against it before setting srcObject.

Would you consider copying
<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Roc/WorkerCanvasProposal">https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Roc/WorkerCanvasProposal</A> to
<A HREF="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Category:Proposals">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Category:Proposals</A> so that it's easier to
collaborate on it?
