</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main thread, and that setting and getting has to be coordinated with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> postMessage for synchronization. The relationship between a &quot;commit&quot; and its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;present&quot; has to be deduced by reasoning about the timing of messages,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than by just reasoning about JS data flow through postMessage.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using ImageBitmap for this has a lot of issues.  It requires synchronizing
</I>&gt;<i> with scripts in the UI thread.
</I>
This isn't difficult, and amounts to a few additional lines of code in
the main thread's onmessage handler.

The ImageBitmap style proposal has another significant advantage in
that it allows a single canvas context to present results in multiple
output regions on the page.


&gt;<i>  It requires manualling resize your canvas
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly to fit different destinations.  It also may potentially create
</I>&gt;<i> lots of backbuffers. Here's an example of code using ImageBitmap
</I>&gt;<i> incorrectly, leading to excess memory allocation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> function render()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     var canvas = myWorkerCanvas;
</I>&gt;<i>     renderTo(canvas);
</I>&gt;<i>     var buffer = canvas.transferToImageBitmap();
</I>&gt;<i>     postMessage(buffer);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> setTimeout(render, 1);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We start with one backbuffer available, render to it (renderTo), peel it off
</I>&gt;<i> the canvas to be displayed somewhere, and toss it off to the main thread.
</I>&gt;<i> (For the sake of the example, the main thread is busy and doesn't process it
</I>&gt;<i> immediately.)  The worker enters render() again, and when it gets to
</I>&gt;<i> renderTo, a new backbuffer has to be allocated, since the one buffer we have
</I>&gt;<i> is still used by the ImageBuffer and can't be changed.  This happens
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly, creating new backbuffers each time, since none of them can be
</I>&gt;<i> reused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an extreme example, but if this ever happens even once, it means
</I>&gt;<i> potentially allocating an extra backbuffer.
</I>
This sort of resource exhaustion is certainly possible, but I view
this downside as smaller than the upside of addressing both of the
above use cases.

-Ken


&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This proposal also requires that whenever a worker is going to return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> image data to the main thread, the main thread must start things off by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creating a canvas element. It's also not possible for a worker to spawn off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sub-workers to do drawing (at least, not without some really ugly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coordination with the main thread.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure it is.  If you want an offscreen buffer, you just &quot;new WorkerCanvas()&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This is unrelated to offscreen drawing.
