Every task would start with a 'clean' graphics state. We could define ways
to pass other canvas contexts into a task. Those other contexts could even
be drawn in other tasks (so you could use them while they are being drawn)

No. Every task acts like a unique canvas context; there's no sharing of
state.
I'm unsure how this would work for WebGL since I'm not all that familiar
with its architecture. However, it seems that the end result of a webgl
application, is a series of commands that are sent to the graphics chip. In
theory, this should be compatible.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this supports a worker/task generating a steady stream of
</I>&gt;<i> frames, e.g. for a 3D game. Does it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It should. When the promise of a task if fulfilled, the main thread could
schedule another task. I think the scheduling should be done inside a
requestAnimationFrame for best performance.

Since there can only be 1 task with the same id active at a time, an author
could just continuously schedule tasks in requestAnimationFrame.
In that case if the tasks need to be synchronized, I think the author would
create 1 main task that generates subtasks to draw different parts of a
scene. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a &quot;flush&quot; to the screen since tasks
would be scheduled all the time.

That's OK!
