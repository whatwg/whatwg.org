</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I agree that's exactly what the spec says.

</I>
Well, I assume that there was a good reason that this was added to the spec.
It's too bad that Rich is on vacation since he is most familiar with this.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Windows has a system setting for high-contrast mode. When you turn on high
</I>&gt;<i> contrast mode, it changes the default color palette. There's no other
</I>&gt;<i> effect on the focus ring that I know of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Windows also has settings for the focus ring width. I agree those should
</I>&gt;<i> affect the system focus ring, but I don't think users would expect that to
</I>&gt;<i> override a canvas author's focus ring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> High contrast mode may affect the system focus ring color, it's true - but
</I>&gt;<i> there's no reason to believe that this system focus ring would look better
</I>&gt;<i> on a canvas when high contrast mode is on, and in fact it might look much
</I>&gt;<i> worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third-party accessibility tools that draw focus rings aren't relevant
</I>&gt;<i> here. They draw independently of applications; applications like browsers
</I>&gt;<i> are not supposed to draw anything different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It is possible that this is designed for an in-house application that uses
the canvas APIs. It doesn't have to be a browser.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, here's another argument: a canvas can contain absolutely anything. It
</I>&gt;<i> might contain a wild and crazy color palette. Only the canvas author knows
</I>&gt;<i> what focus ring is going to be visible on top of that canvas. If the canvas
</I>&gt;<i> is white text on a black background, then a dark-colored focus ring is
</I>&gt;<i> going to be practically invisible, and vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A focus ring could use blending modes or other graphical features that
would ensure that it's always visible.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It just doesn't make any sense to me that we're providing an API that
</I>&gt;<i> says, if you want to draw your own focus ring, use this - BUT, under some
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances we're going to tell you not to draw it and the browser or
</I>&gt;<i> operating system is going to draw it for you, even though the browser has
</I>&gt;<i> no idea what colors are on your canvas and what type of focus ring would be
</I>&gt;<i> visible against it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the author wants to draw their own focus ring, it's probably for a good
</I>&gt;<i> reason. We should let them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, since the author doesn't know that special focus rings are required,
it's reasonable to let the UA handle that case.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We may also want to give web authors visibility into the system color
</I>&gt;<i> palette so they can adjust the entire canvas - and not just focus rings -
</I>&gt;<i> for high contrast mode. But that's out of the scope of this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes

Great.
This means that the steps from 'scrollPathIntoView' [1] should go into the
focus ring steps too.
