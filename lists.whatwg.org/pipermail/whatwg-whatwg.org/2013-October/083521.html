<PRE>I just noticed that Canvas already has a Canvas.setContext() method, which
seems to do exactly what I'm proposing, even down to clearing the
backbuffer on attach.  The only difference is that it lives on Canvas
instead of the context--the only reason I put it there in my proposal was
because this only seemed useful for WebGL.  Given that, I think this
proposal can be simplified down to just: &quot;put setContext on WorkerCanvas
too&quot;.

I left out these details in my initial post in order to see what people
thought at a high level before delving into details.  Attaching when
already attached would replace the old attachment.  It's not possible for
two workers to attach to the same canvas, since only a single WorkerCanvas
can exist for any given canvas; and the original Canvas can't be attached
to if a WorkerCanvas was created (eg. it's in the &quot;proxied&quot; mode).


&gt;<i> What if one of those contexts is 2D and the other is
</I>&gt;<i> WebGL? Currently it's illegal to try to fetch two different context
</I>&gt;<i> types for a single Canvas. The current CanvasProxy spec contains
</I>&gt;<i> several complex rules for these cases, and they're not easy to
</I>&gt;<i> understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is handled by setContext: attaching a context detaches any
previously-attached context.


&gt;<i> Will it be guaranteed that if you have a WebGL context, attachToCanvas
</I>&gt;<i> to canvas1, do some rendering, and then attachToCanvas to canvas2,
</I>&gt;<i> that the only remaining buffer in canvas1 is its color buffer? No
</I>&gt;<i> depth buffers, multisample buffers, etc. will have to remain for some
</I>&gt;<i> reason?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you reattach to canvas1 in the future, the buffers are cleared, which
means you can discard or reuse those buffers as soon as you attach to a
different canvas.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would WebGL's preserveDrawingBuffer attribute, which is a property
</I>&gt;<i> of the context, interact with directing its output to multiple
</I>&gt;<i> canvases?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Since attaching the canvas clears it, that would override
preserveDrawingBuffer.


&gt;<i> Fundamentally I think the behavior is easier to spec, and the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation is easier to make correct, if the ultimate destination
</I>&gt;<i> is an image rather than a canvas, and the color buffer is transferred
</I>&gt;<i> out of the WorkerCanvas in an explicit step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Whether that's true or not, making things easy for the user takes priority
over making things easy for spec writers and implementation.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
(This is a proposal for attachToCanvas--now setContext--not against
transferToImageBitmap, if there are use cases that transferToImageBitmap
solves best in its own right.  It seems like toBlob already handles this,
though.)
