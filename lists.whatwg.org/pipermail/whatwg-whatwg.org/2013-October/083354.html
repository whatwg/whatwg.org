</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Basically it's simpler to have CanvasProxy/WorkerCanvas only supported on
workers. Cross-origin isn't itself a concern.


&gt;<i>    2. Add a worker-only WorkerCanvas constructor that takes the desired
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    width/height of the drawing surface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This looks like it's trying to allow entirely off-screen rendering within a
</I>&gt;<i> Worker, which is fine, but there's no way to resize the backing store in
</I>&gt;<i> this mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We don't have a use-case for resizing the backing store of a worker-created
canvas.

&gt;<i> simply draw in a loop without yielding.  To solve this, if commit is
</I>&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the current dimensions on the main thread don't match the dimensions
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the WorkerCanvas it would fail (return false) and update the dimensions
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the WorkerCanvas before returning.  This is technically a violation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run-to-completion semantics, but is needed to support workers that do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yield.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like it's easy to get wrong, since it'll probably be rare.  An
</I>&gt;<i> exception might be better, so if you don't handle it you at least get an
</I>&gt;<i> error logged to the console.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, that's probably better.

There will be flicker issues with this.  The canvas is cleared when you
&gt;<i> change width or height.  In the UI thread that's OK, since the author can
</I>&gt;<i> synchronously redraw immediately after changing the size.  Here, it's
</I>&gt;<i> likely it won't be redrawn in time, so it'll flicker whenever the size
</I>&gt;<i> changes, especially if it's being changed smoothly.  Here's a suggestion to
</I>&gt;<i> fix this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - When the UI thread changes Canvas.width or Canvas.height, it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> actually resize buffers.  Instead, it sends a message to the WorkerCanvas
</I>&gt;<i> asking for the change.  Until the change actually happens, the Canvas
</I>&gt;<i> continues to be composited as before.  (However, the change to .width and
</I>&gt;<i> .height is visible on the object immediately.)
</I>&gt;<i> - When the WorkerCanvas's event loop receives a message asking for a size
</I>&gt;<i> change:
</I>&gt;<i>   - Change the size of the back-buffer, and update WorkerCanvas.width and
</I>&gt;<i> WorkerCanvas.height accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>   - Fire onresize on the WorkerCanvas.  The worker is expected to redraw
</I>&gt;<i> here.  (This is where the &quot;implicit commit&quot; matters: we want to guarantee a
</I>&gt;<i> commit here.)
</I>&gt;<i>   - Only when the newly-redrawn buffer is committed does the front buffer's
</I>&gt;<i> size get updated to match the back-buffer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, when you change the size in the UI thread, it continues to
</I>&gt;<i> composite the same image (possibly not filling the whole element, or being
</I>&gt;<i> stretched) until the worker actually gets the resize and has a chance to
</I>&gt;<i> redraw it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This also means the idea of not being able to commit because of a resize
</I>&gt;<i> can go away, and commit() can be void, since the back-buffer size never
</I>&gt;<i> actually changes while the worker is drawing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is the slight problem that changing both width and height would fire
two events.

A bigger problem is that your approach isn't compatible with a worker that
draws frames in a loop without yielding. I'm uncertain how important that
is, so I'll wait for Kyle to address that.
