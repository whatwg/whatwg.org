</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'll work on drawing up an example of my proposal.

With WorkerCanvas and transferToImageBitmap, you can draw multiple layers
&gt;<i> in parallel (and actually draw, not just queue drawing commands) by
</I>&gt;<i> creating multiple workers, having them each produce an ImageBitmap, and
</I>&gt;<i> compositing those ImageBitmaps together by stacking &lt;img&gt; elements or
</I>&gt;<i> drawing them all to a single canvas. It uses more memory but you get more
</I>&gt;<i> parallelism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
They would still have to wait for each other so the images are composited
in-order. If you don't care about that, the 'synchronized' option would let
you draw as soon as you exit the task (which is how Chrome always draws
since it's faster)

In fact, an implementation could choose to take the deferred-drawing
&gt;<i> approach instead. You would queue up drawing commands in the WorkerCanvas
</I>&gt;<i> (or the drawing context), and then transferToImageBitmap would not
</I>&gt;<i> immediately render but produce an ImageBitmap implementation encapsulating
</I>&gt;<i> the list of drawing commands to be drawn later, wherever/whenever that
</I>&gt;<i> ImageBitmap ended up being used. I think for commit() the implementation
</I>&gt;<i> would always want to force rasterization on the worker (or possibly some
</I>&gt;<i> dedicated canvas-rendering thread); you could forward a list of drawing
</I>&gt;<i> commands to the compositor thread for rasterization but I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> there's any reason to do that (and some good reasons not to).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can you tell me how you can ensure that you don't do too much work? Drawing
in a continuous loop using 'Commit' would waste a lot of resources.
