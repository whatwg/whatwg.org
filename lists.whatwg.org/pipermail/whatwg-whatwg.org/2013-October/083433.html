&gt;<i> &gt; The reason I did not extend this to navigation and Worker.terminate() is

</I>&gt;<i> desired
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (assuming that you can handle window.onunload and have control over the
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calling terminate(), respectively.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although perhaps my argument is a bit weaker about terminate() than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; navigation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you see a good reason why we should not leave those cases to authors?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While technically possible for a webpage to handle ports that were
</I>&gt;<i> passed to a worker and send a signal before the worker is terminated,
</I>&gt;<i> it is really hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off it means that you have to create a separate MessageChannel
</I>&gt;<i> just for the close-signal. You can't get the worker to to send the
</I>&gt;<i> message without first finishing both the currently running task, and
</I>&gt;<i> also processing all the tasks on the workers task queue. This would
</I>&gt;<i> defeat the whole purpose of terminate(). So you need to keep a
</I>&gt;<i> separate channel specifically to send the close message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, you need to track all the ports that are own by a specific
</I>&gt;<i> worker so that you know which channels to send a close message for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third, since the close message comes from a separate channel than
</I>&gt;<i> other messages, it means that you have to deal with races. When you
</I>&gt;<i> get a message from the separate channel that the main channel is
</I>&gt;<i> dying, there might still be message in the pipe for the main channel.
</I>&gt;<i> But there is no way to know when you got the last one. Timeouts are
</I>&gt;<i> probably the only way, and that's obviously racy/slow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short: The pain! It is burning!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, yeah this is enough to convince me.  :-)


&gt;<i> For navigation things are better since the caller can always use an
</I>&gt;<i> onpagehide/onunload send a signal saying that the port is going away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.  And actually web pages may want to differentiate between
onpagehide and onunload, so it seems more appropriate to let them handle
that case however they need to.


&gt;<i> It occurs to me that all of the proposals here does expose some amount
</I>&gt;<i> of GC behavior. Even a &quot;channeldropped&quot; message which is sent only
</I>&gt;<i> when the other side crashes exposes GC behavior. If GC happens to run
</I>&gt;<i> before the crash and then collect the MessageChannel ports, then no
</I>&gt;<i> channel exists at the time of crash, and thus no event is sent.
</I>&gt;<i> However if the GC runs later, or if it doesn't successfully collect
</I>&gt;<i> the MessageChannel ports, then the &quot;channeldropped&quot; event does fire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not sure if I understand this.  If the MessagePort exists on the side
that is interested to handle the event, then it can't be GCed on the other
side either, right?


&gt;<i> That's not to say that this solution wouldn't work. Exposing some
</I>&gt;<i> amount of GC behavior might be ok. But it does mean that we should
</I>&gt;<i> have a realistic bar as we discuss expanding the event to more
</I>&gt;<i> situations than just process crashes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One solution which I think would never expose GC behavior is to simply
</I>&gt;<i> have a property on the MessagePort which indicates if the owner of the
</I>&gt;<i> other side has been killed or navigated away from. No event would fire
</I>&gt;<i> as that property changes value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since it's a property, it can only be read if a reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> MessagePort is being held. As long as such a reference exists neither
</I>&gt;<i> side of the MessageChannel can be GCed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Exposing this state as a property will make people who have use cases such
as &quot;Update the UI if this other tab/page/app/etc is killed&quot; poll the
attribute, which seems non-ideal to me.
