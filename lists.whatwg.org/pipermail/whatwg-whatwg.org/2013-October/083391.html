</I>
I mean that if you have a line that consists of a series of dashes, and 
you want to stroke it with a dash pattern, you'll get ugly results if you 
start again with each subpath. For example:

  // <A HREF="http://goo.gl/rPN5Eg">http://goo.gl/rPN5Eg</A>
  c.setLineDash([3])
  c.beginPath();
  c.moveTo(100,100);
  c.lineTo(120,100);
  c.moveTo(130,100);
  c.lineTo(150,100);
  c.moveTo(160,100);
  c.lineTo(180,100);
  c.moveTo(190,100);
  c.lineTo(210,100);
  c.stroke();

You get something like:

   -- -- -- -   -- -- -- -   -- -- -- -   -- -- -- -

...instead of:

   -- -- -- -   - -- -- --    -- -- --    -- -- -- -

...which would look more balanced.


&gt;<i> Also, I did not see a reference to curves and how they should be 
</I>&gt;<i> handled.
</I>
Could you elaborate on what text in the spec you think doesn't handle 
curved lines?

This thread now is mainly about what the default should be.

</I>&gt;<i> I am curious as to the motivation for creating a new dashing model

</I>
Yes; it's addressing the problems that have been discussed in this thread 
several times.

 - the dash density is biased to the start of the pattern if you reset 
   with each subpath, which is aesthetically displeasing

 - if the pattern resets at each subpath, then you can't take a dashed 
   path and then split it arbitrarily, moving subparts of the path, 
   without the pattern suddenly shifting when the path is &quot;cut&quot;.

If we are going to have per-point control over this behaviour (as 
suggested in the aforementioned bug), then I don't mind so much what the 
default behaviour is.


&gt;<i> Introducing a new dashing model adds complexity to conversions from one 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics model to another, e.g., when printing a web page or saving it 
</I>&gt;<i> as PDF, converting from PDF to HTML or exporting to HTML from current 
</I>&gt;<i> WYSIWYG drawing/design programs.  For example, PDF and SVG both have an 
</I>&gt;<i> operator to stroke and fill a path.  Compound paths, (e.g. a donut with 
</I>&gt;<i> an inner and outer circle), that are both stroked and fill would need to 
</I>&gt;<i> be duplicated and broken up into two paths to be drawn correctly into 
</I>&gt;<i> this model - assuming they are created in an application/format that 
</I>&gt;<i> works with the PDF/SVG stroking model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, I think that having dashes continue across sub paths 
</I>&gt;<i> introduces uncertainty in the graphic design. Consider a designer 
</I>&gt;<i> editing a sub-path on a dashed path with multiple sub paths. Changing 
</I>&gt;<i> the length of one sub-path will affect the dashing on the other sub 
</I>&gt;<i> paths. This is really counter intuitive to what is expected. Also, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that from a designers perspective it will be harder to create a 
</I>&gt;<i> desired look on compound paths (unless you like adding numbers as you 
</I>&gt;<i> work). I think the placement of the dash on start and end points of 
</I>&gt;<i> paths and sub paths is the critical design element and continuing 
</I>&gt;<i> dashing across sub paths defeats this.
</I>
These are good arguments for the reset behaviour. I don't see them as 
particularly more or less compelling than the arguments above. If we are 
going to eventually allow both behaviours, it's kind of moot; all that 
matters then is the default.


&gt;<i> Finally, I think the join and other effects suggested as motivations for 
</I>&gt;<i> the new dashing model are higher level and should be styles settings or 
</I>&gt;<i> similar where the underlying implementation uses the basic stroking 
</I>&gt;<i> apparatus to achieve the desired look.
</I>
Not sure what this means.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's my concrete use case. I have a dashed line. I want the user to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do I get this effect with the mechanism you describe?

Why is that a sufficient answer for my case but not yours? It seems it 
would apply equally well in both cases.

Fair enough. I've changed the spec to reset at new subpaths.

My understanding is that the specced behaviour here matches SVG, right?


&gt;<i> 2) the way of handling dash sequences with an odd number of elements

</I>
What's the alternative? Implying a zero at the end? I don't have a strong 
opinion on this, though it does seem more useful to treat [3] as [3,3] 
than as [3,0].


&gt;<i> 3) The method of mapping the dash pattern to the path: I suspected this
</I>&gt;<i> might be a problem, but I didn't really pay much attention to it until this
</I>&gt;<i> thread started.
</I>
This should now match the industry convention.


&gt;<i> 4) Inflating paths: this did not worry me at all. I was confident that any
</I>&gt;<i> differences in results would be negligible and decided not to even
</I>&gt;<i> investigate unless someone reported a bug.
</I>
As far as I can tell, the spec here is what you'd expect.

I don't think this is a cast of going to Abilene. At least, not for me. I 
don't see what else would be better than what we have now, here.

Agreed.

In this case, if we add a feature in the future to control this, it'll be 
moot -- all the various behaviours will be possible.
