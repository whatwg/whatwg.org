&gt;<i> 2) General notification callback entry point

</I>&gt;<i> now we use navigator.mozSetMessageHandler('notification',
</I>&gt;<i> function(){}).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but I would prefer to see a more official entry point in the spec. I

</I>
We currently do not have a way to have events out-of-band for the web.


&gt;<i> 3) onclick fires onclose too?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seemed a bit unclear in the spec, but right now FirefoxOS fires
</I>&gt;<i> onclose too for onclick actions, as the onclick pathway removes the
</I>&gt;<i> notification from the list of notifications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems counterintuitive to me, I would have only expected one
</I>&gt;<i> event. Perhaps clarifying the onclick behavior would be good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer to just see one event fired in this case, if
</I>&gt;<i> onclick/onclose are kept around. If the general notification callback
</I>&gt;<i> entry point is established, then just firing it once with the
</I>&gt;<i> event.clicked property set to true for the clicked route.
</I>
That seems like an implementation detail. Activation could mean
dismissal, but e.g. on Mac OS X activation does not mean dismissal.
It's up to the site/app to dismiss after activation and sometimes they
decide to keep the notification around for a bit.


&gt;<i> 4) onclick does not bring web app to front
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This may be part of just further defining the steps for the &quot;click&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> pathway in the spec, but at least in FirefoxOS right now, the
</I>&gt;<i> notification onclick pathway does not bring the app to the visible
</I>&gt;<i> front in all cases. The email app has to do some extra document.hidden
</I>&gt;<i> checking and try to bring itself to the front.
</I>
That seems like a UI detail we cannot really say anything about in the
specification.


&gt;<i> 5) Ability to set notification modes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This one is a bit less defined. I would rather this one is discarded
</I>&gt;<i> than spending too much time on it if it meant losing track of the
</I>&gt;<i> points above:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For email notifications, we did not necessarily want the phone to
</I>&gt;<i> light up the screen on every notification and make a sound or vibrate
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly at night), but rather just register the notification and
</I>&gt;<i> have it show up in the notification count and listing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While ideally there is UI for the user to control notification
</I>&gt;<i> behavior for all web apps, I can also see the case for allowing
</I>&gt;<i> notifications the ability to opt in to the notification modes it
</I>&gt;<i> prefers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any user settings would override the modes specified in the
</I>&gt;<i> notification, but for apps that did want to be nice, it would be a way
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid a very annoying first notification behavior, in the case of
</I>&gt;<i> email, not disturbing the user unless they did an explicit override.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This may be too tricky to specify, but I started a bugzilla bug for
</I>&gt;<i> FirefoxOS for this[2]. One suggestion was listing the preferred modes
</I>&gt;<i> in the web app manifest, but I can see an app may have different types
</I>&gt;<i> of notifications, so it would be more flexible to set per Notification
</I>&gt;<i> instance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [2] <A HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912645">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912645</A>
</I>
I think we should hold off on this until we have more experience with
notifications in the web platform. Still very early days.
