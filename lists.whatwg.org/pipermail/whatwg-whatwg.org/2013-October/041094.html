</I>&gt;<i> One of the use cases that has come up for why people are still using

</I>
Right now, with &lt;input type=file accept=image/* capture&gt; [1], a browser 
can be told to prefer an appropriate media capture device rather than 
offering a file system or gallery option by default.

[1] <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/camera/">http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/camera/</A>

In practice I don't know how much that has really taken off. On mobile 
devices, especially on Android, where intent-based application cooperation 
is pretty mature, &lt;input type=file accept=image/*&gt; tends to be enough to 
offer the user a full list of appropriate applications, including scanners 
or cameras or galleries or whatnot.

</I>&gt;<i> camera-backed capturing.
</I>
capture=&quot;&quot; has moved to just being a boolean attribute.

But yeah, I think we should focus on this kind of approach before exposing 
new controls and APIs, to see what authors end up wanting.

They can.


&gt;<i> * Should we give the site any way to specify preferred resolution or 
</I>&gt;<i> color depth for an image? Or should the site be prepared process any 
</I>&gt;<i> images to the required resolution, convert to monochrome, etc.
</I>
The question is, what are the use cases? Presumably the user's hardware 
might be limited in ways the page didn't expect anyway, so whether the 
page gives defaults or not they'll have to deal with varied results, so 
the use case isn't simplicity.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise it would be nice to have an API for re-encoding images without 
</I>&gt;<i> using canvas. This will likely be especially important if we decide on a 
</I>&gt;<i> jpeg successor to add support for.
</I>
This comes up occasionally, but we always end up going back to just 
working on putting canvas on workers, so...

Anyone?

I'd recommend going with &lt;input type=file accept=image/*&gt; for now, and 
seeing where that gets us. We can always add attributes or an API if 
there's a real need for more control.
