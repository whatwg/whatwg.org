I'm not sure that you and Rik are talking about the same thing, since he's
still talking about &quot;outstanding tasks&quot;. If you are talking about the same
thing, I don't know what it is. I'd like to see some concrete details for
what you'd change in the current WorkerCanvas proposal. For the sake of
clarity I've put (my understand of) it here:
<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Roc/WorkerCanvasProposal">https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Roc/WorkerCanvasProposal</A>

With WorkerCanvas and transferToImageBitmap, you can draw multiple layers
in parallel (and actually draw, not just queue drawing commands) by
creating multiple workers, having them each produce an ImageBitmap, and
compositing those ImageBitmaps together by stacking &lt;img&gt; elements or
drawing them all to a single canvas. It uses more memory but you get more
parallelism.

In fact, an implementation could choose to take the deferred-drawing
approach instead. You would queue up drawing commands in the WorkerCanvas
(or the drawing context), and then transferToImageBitmap would not
immediately render but produce an ImageBitmap implementation encapsulating
the list of drawing commands to be drawn later, wherever/whenever that
ImageBitmap ended up being used. I think for commit() the implementation
would always want to force rasterization on the worker (or possibly some
dedicated canvas-rendering thread); you could forward a list of drawing
commands to the compositor thread for rasterization but I don't think
there's any reason to do that (and some good reasons not to).
