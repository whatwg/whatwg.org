</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; applications that use dashed rectangles will start looking 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Do we really have enough deployed content using this API that we

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not sure I follow. Are you asking who would use dashed rectangles in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; canvas?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You mentioned &quot;existing applications&quot;. I'm just curious which these 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Websites using canvas?
</I>
Do you have URLs I could look at?


&gt;<i> &gt; Specifically: it allows for all three kinds of renderings. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the behaviour you're describing by creating new paths. You can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the behaviour I'm describing by using a single path. You can have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the behaviour Justin described by a modest addition to the path API 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (as he described). This is better than the alternative because it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more flexible. Justin also pointed out some other arguments, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifically that not restarting at each subpath results in an overall 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more even distribution of the dash density, which is aethestically 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pleasing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why are you breaking a path up in sections in the first place?
</I>
Presumably because it's not a continuous path. For example, it might be a 
stick figure with two arms and two legs and a head. It's not clear how you 
would draw that as one continuous path.


&gt;<i> That is not guarenteed to look the same anyway since if you have curves, 
</I>&gt;<i> you will get gaps.
</I>
Not guaranteed to look the same as what? I'm not sure anyone is asking for 
anything to look the same as something else.


&gt;<i> &gt; It would be really funky that if you took a line:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    ---------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...and then split it in three and moved the three parts around in an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; animated fashion:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    ---------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             ---------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                      ---------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...the dash pattern would change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those are 3 lines; they are no longer 1 segment. (model of stroking = 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing with a pen)
</I>
Here's my concrete use case. I have a dashed line. I want the user to 
click two points on it, and then I want to split the line at those points 
and move the three segements independently. I do not want the dashes to 
change when I go from there being one line to there being three.

How do I get this effect with the mechanism you describe?


&gt;<i> setLineDash([30]);
</I>&gt;<i> rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
</I>&gt;<i> rect(10, 110, 100, 100);
</I>&gt;<i> rect(10, 210, 100, 100);
</I>&gt;<i> stroke();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These rectangles should look the same.
</I>
I presume you mean &quot;I want those rectangles to look the same&quot;. I don't see 
any a priori objective reason why they should look the same.

You could get that effect easily with my proposal:

 setLineDash([30]);
 beginPath();
 rect(10, 10, 100, 100);
 stroke();
 beginPath();
 rect(10, 110, 100, 100);
 stroke();
 beginPath();
 rect(10, 210, 100, 100);
 stroke();


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For reason 3, authors will be surprised that identical constructs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from SVG, Core Graphics or their drawing applications would look 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; different in Canvas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think most authors of Web applications have never used those APIs. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where is the data demonstrating this one way or the other?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen several applications that morph SVG data into Canvas. Adobe 
</I>&gt;<i> has tools that create canvas drawing calls to do stroking. Mozilla's 
</I>&gt;<i> shumway and pdf.js rely on this as well.
</I>
Sure. We can support these easily if we implement dashing as the spec says 
now, by just adding the feature Justin suggested: an annotation on the 
path that says to reset the dash offset.
