I can confirm that. I have installed some fonts I designed myself and 
did not give to anyone else so far, so I would be perfectly identifyable 
and traceable by the list of installed fonts.

&gt;<i> You have already suggested that access to some information is necessary.

</I>&gt;<i> And consider how the information would be accessed using existing web
</I>&gt;<i> technologies: OAuth HTTP uri-list. Ponder whether access to local fonts
</I>&gt;<i> is to specific of a function to be supported explicitly by web browsers.
</I>
How do the manufacturers of &quot;cloud&quot;-based office applications such as 
Google Docs or MS Office 365 handle this? Do their clients accept the 
fact that fonts they might have purchased are not useable in their 
office application? Or do they have local software installed that 
corresponds with the web-based applications?
