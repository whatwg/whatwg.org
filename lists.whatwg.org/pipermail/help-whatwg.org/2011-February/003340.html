Not sure how helpful my reply will be to you... I am reminded of a few links

&quot;A Brief History of Markup&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-markup/">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-markup/</A>

... and:

&quot;Frequently Asked Questions About XHTML vs HTML&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=393445">http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=393445</A>

When I first started learning HTML, I was taught XHTML by college
professors and books. Eventually, I was convinced that HTML was the
better path to head down and so I switched. Ever since then, I have
use html 4.01 strict, and I am waiting for the day that I can use
HTML5 without any fuss.

With that said, I think the first article I linked to above is a
pretty good read. The sitepoint post has a lot of good info, but I
don't think it touches on HTML5.

I guess the point I am making is that maybe the specifications are not
the best place to look for a clear cut answer.

Well, not sure if my reply is of any help to you... Great question though! :)

Cheers,
Micky
