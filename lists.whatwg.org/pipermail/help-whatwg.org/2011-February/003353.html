<PRE>Animusdius,

Download is the web paradigm. Does this have anything to do with html?

&gt;<i> Thank you for pointing it out. As I mentioned above I am quite well acquainted with the technology. Still, it is no more than a pretext. I don't think YouTube are treating their content as downloadable, certainly not the most of their publishers, otherwise they'd just provide the links to download themselves and there'd be no reason for 3d party software to exist. I can't believe how many people on this list miss the point.

In other words, it would be nice to disallow video download without any hacks, so people can view it but can't download it if the publisher doesn't want to. I mean, you can use Google search, or you could buy their search servers for your enterprise but they weren't obliged to let you have a look at the source code and download it.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is, that once those bits are streaming to a viewer they can be captured and saved.  There are plugins for browsers to do that already.  Once the data streams to the user it's out of your control.  Viewing, in effect, has to be considered the same as saving because you've already turned the bits over to them and you don't have control over the software they're viewing with.  This doesn't just apply to the html5 video, but is also true about flash.
