</I>There's a lot going on in the area of &quot;HTML5 applications&quot;, but it is 
mostly tangential to what is called &quot;HTML5&quot; at W3C and &quot;HTML Living 
Standard&quot; at WHATWG. &quot;HTML5 application&quot; has become a common expression, 
but it has little to do with HTML5; instead, it refers to programming 
applications in JavaScript, with the intent of running them in browser 
engines. For this, you need at least a little piece of HTML and in 
practice CSS as well. But there is no specific need for a particular 
version of HTML.

What is called &quot;HTML5&quot; at W3C and &quot;HTML Living Standard&quot; at WHATWG 
contains many features that are application-oriented, aimed (among other 
things) making it easier to create &quot;HTML5 applications&quot;. For example, 
application cache and localStorage. But useful as they may be, on 
supporting browsers, they are not necessary for &quot;HTML5 applications&quot;.
