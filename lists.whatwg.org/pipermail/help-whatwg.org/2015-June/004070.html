</I>
Continuing from the &quot;The reality dysfunction&quot; example:

&quot;The reality dysfunction&quot; is a book. You can think of &lt;header&gt; as being 
&quot;the book cover&quot;, and &lt;h1&gt; as being &quot;the book title&quot;. But it turns out 
that (the first edition of) &quot;The reality dysfunction&quot; has two titles.

There are other things on the book cover, though. The page author, a quote 
from a review, the publisher's name. Those things are paragraphs, not 
headings.

That is why you might want to distinguish the heading(s) from the other 
text on the header. They're conceptually different.


&gt;<i> IMHO, there's nothing wrong with that markup.
</I>
Yeah, using a &lt;p&gt; and &lt;header&gt; would work too. I wouldn't stress too much 
over it. Use whichever seems most useful in your case.


&gt;<i> &gt; it feels like the &lt;h2&gt; in the WHATWG comes from a desire to quickly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; style, not because it's the most appropriate tag.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not for style purposes. It is to replace the empty semantics of 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;div class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt; and &lt;div class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;.
</I>
Yeah. There's more to it than just styling. But of course, being able to 
easily style it is also a big part of it.


&gt;<i> To be fair to your question, I'm not sure of the usefulness of several 
</I>&gt;<i> new elements. I think there's a certain bit of &quot;we see &lt;div class=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> on lots of pages, let's create element &lt;foo&gt; to replace it&quot;.
</I>

&gt;<i> The most pointless, to me, is &lt;main&gt;. I have no idea what it's supposed 
</I>&gt;<i> to do. My page has main content. It's everything that's not &lt;nav&gt; and 
</I>&gt;<i> not &lt;aside&gt;.
</I>
I agree. &lt;main&gt; was added because browsers implemented it, so it was 
essentially free to add. (It was added by browsers because of discussions 
in the W3C, as I understand it.)

That's one of the non-style uses for it, yes.
