This particular linguistic ship sailed some years ago now (at the latest 
the mid 90s, long before I was involved with Web standards). For all 
intents and purposes, the term &quot;semantics&quot; in an HTML context refers to 
the meaning of media-independant elements, as distinct from elements like 
&lt;font&gt; or &lt;blink&gt; which describe a physical presentation for a specific 
medium (typically the graphical screen or print medium).
