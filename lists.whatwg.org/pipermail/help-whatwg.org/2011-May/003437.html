&gt;&gt;<i> Navigation links link to resources related to the whole page, right?
</I>&gt;<i> Not necessarily. Especially not in web pages, or applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The individual page may have multiple sections, which are independent of
</I>&gt;<i> each other. In which case you likely want to include such potential &quot;see
</I>&gt;<i> also&quot; links, in a footer placed as a child to the relevant section.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What's your definition of a navigation link.
</I>&gt;<i> Navigation links that i would markup using nav, would basically be anything
</I>&gt;<i> but in-content links.
</I>&gt;<i> If the links is a part of the content on the page, such as the &quot;latest news&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> links on a front page of a news site, then i would limit the use of nav to
</I>&gt;<i> site-section links. I.e. Sports, movies, tv, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>IMO everything only main content should go in body.

Quoting the W3C Editor's Draft:
|<i> The body element represents the main content of the document.
</I>
Yet, a number of children (including nav, aside and figure) don't seem
to form a part of the main content.

&gt;<i> Another place where i wouldn't use nav, is for search results. I.e.
</I>&gt;<i> Google/yahoo results page. And in the case of blogs, for the results on a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;by tag&quot; page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You could easily apply the above to more descendants of &lt;head&gt;. I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not sure how to render empty elements such as &lt;link&gt; and &lt;meta&gt;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't hold me to it, but I'm fairly sure that this is in fact an un-intended
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;feature&quot; thing, which is allowed by browsers that support custom elements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Normally unknown elements gets treated as empty span, if I'm not mistaken.
</I>&gt;<i> What you are experiencing with the styling of title, is likely just an
</I>&gt;<i> unintended side-effect of the possibility to declare your own elements using
</I>&gt;<i> the display property.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> There are several reasons why you wouldn't style the head. For one, what
</I>&gt;<i> purpose should it serve? The support of link for anything but StyleSheets,
</I>&gt;<i> is rather limited. And i already explained why you wouldn't want to include
</I>&gt;<i> links in the head section. I also personally think its a waste of time to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss, because i know the thinking which lies behind (seen it elsewhere),
</I>&gt;<i> but this will have to do for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why would you put links that aren't main content in an element that
represents the main content of the document?

&gt;&gt;<i> Navigation links most likely shouldn't be placed &quot;on a page&quot;, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided out-of-band, or somehow differently from the main content of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the page. An interactive widescreen rendering might render links to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the right of the main content, with a separate scrolling mechanism (if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed). A small-screen (interactive, visual) rendering might provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the links only upon explicit request. The latter would also be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate for people like me who can't concentrate when their screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is full of information they don't need (ATM).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very bad idea, since it would servilely limit the customization
</I>&gt;<i> that web designers and developers have come to love in recent years. There
</I>&gt;<i> would be a lot of angry designers, asking why you stole their navigation
</I>&gt;<i> column.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think it's more important to keep users happy than letting designers
control every pixel on a user's screen. Users need customizability
more than designers.

How would a designer even know whether I render navigation links in a
column or a row?

&gt;<i> Another problem you would have to deal with, is the multitude of different
</I>&gt;<i> layout techniques in use. Removing a navigation column from a website, would
</I>&gt;<i> in many cases tilt the rendering, and might even make the site unusable in
</I>&gt;<i> rare cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Existing pages will keep using &lt;ul&gt;. UAs won't even recognize the
lists as navigational.

&gt;<i> It may have its use for static documents however. Where the rendering is
</I>&gt;<i> less important to the designer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Authors' main concern is content. The user is most interested in the
content. Design is a question of accessibility, aesthetics and
branding, i.e. complementary to the content.
