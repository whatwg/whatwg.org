<PRE>DOH, I forgot to &quot;reply to all&quot;.

================

Hi Jukka! Thank you for the help, I really appreciate it. :)

See my replies inline below.

&gt;<i> It lacks a !DOCTYPE and the &lt;title&gt; element. (It is apparently meant to be a

</I>
DOH! Sorry about that! :D

I guess I was trying to avoid any confusion by leaving out the
boilerplate stuff.

When I get home later tonight I will fork Ricardo's version and
include the missing bits. :)

Sorry about that.

&gt;<i> Many people recommend the use of start and end tags for &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;body&gt; elements. This is largely a matter of style. But I think there is
</I>&gt;<i> almost always a reason to use the &lt;html&gt; tag, so that you can put a lang
</I>&gt;<i> attribute there.
</I>
Definitely! I did not realize that much of that could be left out.
Hehe, I am not sure if I could even force myself to leave out &lt;html&gt;,
&lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;!

&gt;&gt;<i> 1. What do you think about the usage of the H1? In this case, is it a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem to have multiple per page?
</I>&gt;<i> Using &lt;h1&gt; inside &lt;article&gt; effectively lowers its rank with respect to the
</I>&gt;<i> page as a whole. Though such usage is well-defined and allowed in HTML5, its
</I>&gt;<i> main purpose is to allow inclusing of articles into a document without
</I>&gt;<i> changing their heading markup. This is fine and useful in the long run, but
</I>
Ahh, that's why I was asking actually... It would make templating via
my CMS a little easier if I could re-use the same HTML markup from the
&quot;permalink&quot; page (which would be an H1 tag).

&gt;<i> it's just pointlessly risky at present. Current browsers, assistive software
</I>&gt;<i> etc. will blindly treat &lt;h1&gt; as rank 1 heading, without paying attention to
</I>&gt;<i> its appearing inside &lt;article&gt;. You might make them _appear_ as lower-rank
</I>&gt;<i> headings, if you use carefully crafted CSS (and your stylesheet actually
</I>&gt;<i> gets applied), but it's just an indirect way of partially achieving
</I>&gt;<i> something that is best achieved directly.
</I>
Great points!

I think this is where one would say &quot;I can't wait for HTML5 to be the norm&quot;.

For now, I think I would like to markup my pages with the future in
mind, but I definitely don't want to thumb my nose at the present.

&gt;<i> So it would be safer to write, say,
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;h1&gt;Article title&lt;br&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;small&gt;Subhead&lt;/small&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;/h1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;time&gt;...&lt;/time&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/hgroup&gt;
</I>
Ooooh, I like that! Seems like a good spot to use &lt;small&gt;.

I am also happy to see that you included &lt;time&gt; in the &lt;hgroup&gt;. I was
under the assumption that &lt;hgroup&gt; could only contain H* tags. I am
glad to see that other tags can be put in there too.

Just out of curiosity, what are you thoughts about using &lt;hgroup&gt; when
there is only one &lt;H*&gt; tag?

For some reason the name &quot;hgroup&quot; makes me think &quot;only headings and
nothing else&quot;.

&gt;<i> Some people probably question the use of &lt;br&gt; here (is it really a line
</I>&gt;<i> break in the content itself - well, it's structural division if division of
</I>&gt;<i> ...&lt;snip&gt;...
</I>&gt;<i> present) and should render reasonably even without CSS, and could be styled
</I>&gt;<i> with CSS easily, without unnecessarily complicated selectors.
</I>
I dig your example for sure.

I like you point about &quot;render reasonably even without CSS&quot;.

When developing HTML/CSS, I usually like to turn off CSS to see how
things look... In the code example, from my first post, the
block-level &lt;a&gt; was looking pretty horrid when styles were disabled.

Before I contacted this list, I was experimenting with something like
this (code abbreviated for sake of example):

&lt;h*&gt;
&lt;a&gt;&lt;time&gt;...&lt;/time&gt; &nbsp;/&nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;TITLE&lt;/strong&gt; &nbsp;/&nbsp;
&lt;span&gt;SUBHEAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h*&gt;

Like your example, the above renders nicely when CSS is disabled. Of
course, the &lt;h*&gt; would vary depending on the page (index page listing
articles and/or permalink page).

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Can I use&lt;hgroup&gt;  within an&lt;a&gt;  tag?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but should you
</I>
Good question. Probably not. :D

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Thoughts on wrapping time with an H3?
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, it makes the time notation a 3rd-rank heading on current
</I>&gt;<i> ...&lt;snip&gt;...
</I>&gt;<i> of the heading as a whole (heading group). But as a practical move... it
</I>&gt;<i> means taking risks with little if anything that you could possibly win.
</I>
I like they way you think! Thanks for the feedback. :)

&gt;<i> ...&lt;snip&gt;..
</I>&gt;<i> the semantically empty &lt;div&gt;. While that's OK in the long run, well, the run
</I>&gt;<i> _is_ going to be long...
</I>
Ha! I personally can't wait!

The more I use HTML5, the more I love it.

HTML5 is definitely a change in thinking for me from HTML4... There's
lots more to think about, semantically, when sculpting a page; this is
like a double-edged sword for a perfectionist like me!

&gt;<i> However, you could use &lt;p&gt; instead of &lt;div&gt; here, as this seems to be the
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 way in matters like this. And it only costs setting margin: 0 for the
</I>&gt;<i> ...&lt;snip&gt;...
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;time&gt; elements directly. I don't think you need to be more cross-browser
</I>&gt;<i> than that, in such issues, as modern browsers let you style &lt;time&gt; directly.
</I>
Awesome info!

I have actually been playing around with Modernizr, so, like you say,
I might just style the time directly.

Thanks so much for the help Jukka (and everyone), I really appreciate it!!!!
