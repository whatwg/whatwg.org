<PRE>Hi,
I'm wondering what's the best way to mark up paragraphs related to advising, warning, FYIs, contingencies, etc. I'm talking about such paragraphs that typically are prefixed by the word &quot;Note:&quot; or &quot;n.b.,&quot; and are stylized differently from surrounding text.
For example:
&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open the lid&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Place the sheet face down&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Press the copy button&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Note: If the paper jams, then you'll need to... (blah, blah)


I've noticed that these types of notes frequently occur in the HTML spec itself, styled in bold green typeface. For example:
For short inline annotations, the title attribute could be used.
Note: Unfortunately, relying on the title attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet).


In the spec, such notes are marked up as &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; or &lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;. Is this considered the correct way, or is there a more specific element that could be used.
Some candidates I thought might be possible are &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;:
&lt;strong&gt; is described as having strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, and I don't think that fits these kinds of notes.&lt;em&gt; stress emphasis just doesn't seem to fit&lt;i&gt; this could work, in that it's described as &quot;a span of text offset from the normal prose&quot;. But this element (also &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;) are phrasing content, so can it be used to mark up an *entire* paragraph?&lt;b&gt; &quot;attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes&quot;. Again, it's phrasing content so it seems to be intended for use on a phrase rather than a paragraph. But it's semantics seems to &quot;kind of&quot; fit.&lt;aside&gt; I find it hard to say if advisory notes are tangentially related to surrounding content -- I would tend to think not. Also, &lt;aside&gt; is a sectioning element, and I don't think an advisory note is a different section.
Any thoughts?
Thanks,Gordon
