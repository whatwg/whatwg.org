<PRE>I'll go ahead and answer my own concern about &lt;small&gt; being phrasing content. I looked at the spec in regards to paragraphs, and a &lt;small&gt; element between paragraphs would be treated as an implicit paragraph. So no concern there, it seems.

I've been planning on moving these (and examples) to &lt;aside&gt;, though that

requires also changing to using a different heading structure (since

&lt;aside&gt; is a sectioning element and thus resets the outline algorithm to

the top-level heading, if I recall correcty).

Yes, that was one of my concerns. Another subscriber (responding privately) suggested &lt;small&gt;, which I also though could be a good fit semantically, and it avoids the &quot;sectioning issue.&quot; On the other hand, small is classified a phrasing content, so it would have to be nested in a &lt;p&gt; if I understand correctly. Or can it be used in the flow with other &lt;p&gt;'s (assuming its display is changed to block), i.e., 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;...
&lt;small&gt; is also styled as smaller font in by browsers' default style sheets so that's something that most (?) would want to override.

</I>
&gt;<i> &lt;aside&gt; I find it hard to say if advisory notes are tangentially related

&gt;<i> to surrounding content -- I would tend to think not. Also, &lt;aside&gt; is a
</I>
&gt;<i> sectioning element, and I don't think an advisory note is a different
</I>
&gt;<i> section.
</I>


If it's really just an inline paragraph that you happen to want to have

special styling for, as opposed to a side note, then a class is probably

the right way to go. (One way to look at it is: if you dropped the classes

and CSS, would the document still make sense? Or does it only make sense

if it is properly offset in some stylistic way?)

&quot;happen to want to have special styling for.&quot; But surely there'd always be some *reason* for the special styling? If it's &quot;utilitarian&quot; then &lt;b&gt; is appropriate according to the spec, no? Or can you provide a specific example of what you mean here? Perhaps referring to the spec, could you identify a note that you would mark up as an aside vs. a note that you would mark up with .note?

Thanks,Gordon
