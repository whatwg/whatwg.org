</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Before considering proposed alternatives, could you elaborate on how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;preload&quot; is insufficient? (It's impossible for me to evaluate how the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposed alternatives are better without knowing how the existing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; solutions are bad!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure! At the moment I need to set preload to &quot;none&quot; or &quot;metadata&quot;. Often
</I>&gt;<i> we do use more than one video or audio element on the same page, and we do
</I>&gt;<i> want the initial load of each page to be as low as possible. We do have some
</I>&gt;<i> visitors with low bandwidth, or people who use their phones and are charged
</I>&gt;<i> by their ISP by the MB. If we had only high bandwidth users and few elements
</I>&gt;<i> on a page, we'd just use auto. We don't limit our media files to ranges or
</I>&gt;<i> anything like that, we just want our users to have the best possible
</I>&gt;<i> experience viewing the videos provided on the websites we make.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whenever an end user starts a video or audio element that hasn't been
</I>&gt;<i> preloaded, and the end user doesn't have good enough bandwidth to match the
</I>&gt;<i> progressive download of the video file, we tend to get very stuttered and
</I>&gt;<i> broken video for the first seconds, until either the speed of the stream
</I>&gt;<i> picks up or the end users pause the playback themselves and wait for it to
</I>&gt;<i> buffer up a bit. Now with audio this isn't such a big issue since the KB/s
</I>&gt;<i> rate of audio files is so much smaller, but it's very noticeable with video.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can also imagine scenarios where autoplay is set to &quot;on&quot; but the end
</I>&gt;<i> user has low bandwidth, or scenarios where preload is set to &quot;auto&quot; but the
</I>&gt;<i> end user clicks the play button too fast for the file to load. (yes, some of
</I>&gt;<i> our end users are ninja's!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We had the same issue with the experience of progressively downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> media years ago, when I first started our early experiments with flash video
</I>&gt;<i> (before every user had broadband), that was until we set the buffer
</I>&gt;<i> attribute in flash, which fixed the whole issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   A static attribute that specifies a minimum buffer size or duration will
</I>&gt;<i> only help users with exactly the bandwidth the for the attribute value -
</I>&gt;<i> anyone with less bandwidth will still run out of data, and anyone with more
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth will have to wait longer than necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, in some cases (like a dedicated video site) you can have additional
data on the user's bandwidth that the UA doesn't have. Historical playback
data, for example, that shows the user's last N playbacks and the achieved
bitrate.

At the very least it would be nice to be told how much had been loaded
before playback began (maybe as part of an event). I suppose polling
buffered would work, if buffered actually worked properly...

Theoretical scenario:

Listen for canplay -- this _should_ fire when just a couple frames are
ready, yes?
Poll buffered state until desired buffer amount
Call play()

I don't think this actually works today though, largely due to bad
implementations of buffered.
