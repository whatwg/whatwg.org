<PRE>For the record, I'm in favor of something like a &lt;ui&gt; element, I just
have no need for it :)

I tend to think of the elements of HTML5 in two camps: content (&lt;p&gt;,
&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;h#&gt;) and chrome (&lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;).

The content side of the equation has generic, non-semantic elements
(&lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt;) that can be used for any styling purpose.

It doesn't seem as if the chrome side has a generic, non-semantic
element for using the same way. That's where I think your &lt;ui&gt;
suggestion fits in: an open use element that indicates to any agent
that the stuff inside isn't part of the content.

Where I think we disagree is that the &lt;ui&gt; element should affect the
baseline actions of the content within. A &lt;form&gt; within a &lt;ui&gt; should
still submit as a page refresh unless rerouted by JS.

You are probably right that it's too late in the game to have
something like this added now, but it certainly isn't a bad idea. Keep
it around for HTML6 :)

</I>&gt;<i> clearly see that the only actual &quot;document&quot; on the page is the slide you're
</I>&gt;<i> currently working on, everything else is purely UI Chrome and I believe it
</I>&gt;<i> should be marked up as such, not as the ridiculous &lt;div&gt; soup that it is.
</I>&gt;<i> I think I understand what you're saying regarding HTML Documents having no
</I>&gt;<i> notion of AJAX and to a point I agree, but by that argument they also have
</I>&gt;<i> no notion of Javascript and to discount the importance of the new JS API's
</I>&gt;<i> in HTML5 would be wrong. Web apps aren't web apps these days without JS, and
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently, AJAX.
</I>&gt;<i> In order to build web apps properly we've been taught that pages need to
</I>&gt;<i> work over, around, and despite a wide array of inconsistently available
</I>&gt;<i> functionality &#8212; that's the reality we live with in order to have extremely
</I>&gt;<i> interoperable apps (a computing achievement that shouldn't be looked down
</I>&gt;<i> upon). The additional tags in HTML5 don't violate that, and I don't believe
</I>&gt;<i> that a &lt;ui&gt; tag would either. All I'm thinking&#160;is that a subtle realignment
</I>&gt;<i> and enhancement regarding what part of an HTML document is content and which
</I>&gt;<i> part is chrome would be extremely valuable not only to us as developers but
</I>&gt;<i> also to our site's users.
