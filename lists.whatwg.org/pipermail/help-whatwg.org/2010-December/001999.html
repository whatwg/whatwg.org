</I>&gt;<i> Sure! At the moment I need to set preload to &quot;none&quot; or &quot;metadata&quot;. Often

</I>&gt;<i> have some visitors with low bandwidth, or people who use their phones 
</I>&gt;<i> and are charged by their ISP by the MB. If we had only high bandwidth 
</I>&gt;<i> users and few elements on a page, we'd just use auto. We don't limit our 
</I>&gt;<i> media files to ranges or anything like that, we just want our users to 
</I>&gt;<i> have the best possible experience viewing the videos provided on the 
</I>&gt;<i> websites we make.
</I>
In theory, the browsers of your users with low bandwidth, when faced with 
preload=auto, should not preload. But it's early days yet and it isn't 
surprising that they don't yet discriminate.


&gt;<i> Whenever an end user starts a video or audio element that hasn't been 
</I>&gt;<i> preloaded, and the end user doesn't have good enough bandwidth to match 
</I>&gt;<i> the progressive download of the video file, we tend to get very 
</I>&gt;<i> stuttered and broken video for the first seconds, until either the speed 
</I>&gt;<i> of the stream picks up or the end users pause the playback themselves 
</I>&gt;<i> and wait for it to buffer up a bit. Now with audio this isn't such a big 
</I>&gt;<i> issue since the KB/s rate of audio files is so much smaller, but it's 
</I>&gt;<i> very noticeable with video.
</I>
You can work around this with a custom interface that uses the 
oncanplaythrough event handler to decide when to start playing, and 
buffers until then.


&gt;<i> It's in the few starting seconds of cases like this that the end user 
</I>&gt;<i> experience would be enhanced by us having a buffer attribute in our 
</I>&gt;<i> toolbox. We need to make sure a few seconds of a media file always gets 
</I>&gt;<i> loaded before any actual playback begins. The buffer attribute wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> break anything already in place, it would only enhance the attributes 
</I>&gt;<i> already existing. :)
</I>
The browser should be doing this for you anyway when it's showing its own 
controls; when you have your own controls, the API already provides you 
with the tools to do this.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but this also depends on how a developer would use the buffer 
</I>&gt;<i> attribute, for our use we wouldn't set it too high. (3-5 seconds or so 
</I>&gt;<i> is what we would favor at this time). A low bandwidth user would run out 
</I>&gt;<i> of data, but he would get at least 5 seconds of video before this would 
</I>&gt;<i> happen. From my experience with how users interact with video an end 
</I>&gt;<i> user will notice the loaded bar not moving as fast as the scrubber, but 
</I>&gt;<i> at least we've given him a teaser of the full content before he needs to

</I>
If you're writing your own controller, you already have the data available 
to know when five seconds have been buffered, so you can already do this.
