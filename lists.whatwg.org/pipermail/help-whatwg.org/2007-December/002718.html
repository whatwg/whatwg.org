</I>&gt;<i> Flash.  It's the elephant in the room.  There is a reason that YouTube
</I>&gt;<i> and all its clones and almost all social networking sites that host
</I>&gt;<i> videos use Flash wrappers, not to mention that most amateur web sites
</I>&gt;<i> that want to put a video on a page just upload the video to a
</I>&gt;<i> YouTube-like site and copy/paste the HTML code.  It's the clear winner
</I>&gt;<i> in the marketplace, but you said otherwise because no one wants to
</I>&gt;<i> mention the elephant in the room.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Flash is already cross-platform and supported in nearly every browser.
</I>&gt;<i>  Even mobile platforms are beginning to use it.  It came preinstalled
</I>&gt;<i> on the Wii browser, but not on the DS browser.  Even iPhone may soon
</I>&gt;<i> support it.  (I don't know how iPhone is supporting YouTube without
</I>&gt;<i> Flash - I assume it's playing the FLV files directly since YouTube is
</I>&gt;<i> using MPEG-4 for video.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One major problem with Flash (ignoring that it's proprietary, blah
</I>&gt;<i> blah blah), is that even today, you can't just point the Flash Player
</I>&gt;<i> to an FLV file.  You have to create an SWF file that embed the FLV
</I>&gt;<i> file and the video controls.  Of course, many sites use this to their
</I>&gt;<i> advantage - after the video is finished playing they can show
</I>&gt;<i> thumbnails and link to other videos from within the SWF file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to break Flash's dominance on the web (for videos), you'll
</I>&gt;<i> have to outdo its features.  Since YouTube can embed those thumbnails
</I>&gt;<i> and links at the end of a movie, your new open-source-standard-happy
</I>&gt;<i> player will need to be that flexible as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could hope/ask for Adobe to open up SWF as a standard.  There are
</I>&gt;<i> third-party, open-source libs for making SWF files - I assume they
</I>&gt;<i> don't break any patents.  I just don't know how far you'll get that
</I>&gt;<i> route, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could make FLV+MPEG-4+AAC the recommended format, but since Flash
</I>&gt;<i> won't play that file directly (at least today), we still have one
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;object&gt; tag for flash and another &lt;video&gt; tag for the browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be easy with Javascript to support the &lt;video&gt; tag by
</I>&gt;<i> converting it to a &lt;object&gt; that loads an SWF with a set of
</I>&gt;<i> parameters.  With a little more work, you might be able to support the
</I>&gt;<i> DOM API for the video element on top of that.  Also, the browser could
</I>&gt;<i> do this purely transparently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if you want a single standard media player supported by all
</I>&gt;<i> browsers ... that's not Flash, market forces are going to make that a
</I>&gt;<i> pipe dream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't guess I have a single point here, but I we can't discuss the
</I>&gt;<i> pipe dream of standard video players, video formats, and video codecs
</I>&gt;<i> without discussing the elephant in the room.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do think we should recommend a codec that Flash supports since that
</I>&gt;<i> will be the easiest to implement and won't fight against the existing
</I>&gt;<i> behemoth.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
You're right, I had flash in mind all the time I was just trying to 
explain myself. I don't think Flash can ever be replaced because of it's 
flexibility. Maybe in time combinations of canvas + video + audio + 
scripting will be a contender.

Anyway, I missed it off before when I was scanning the spec but I like 
what it has to say about the DOM interface for &lt;video&gt; it and how it 
could work, makes perfect sense. Just curious now from a design 
perspective what could be done without scripting. Is discussion of how 
CSS would apply beyond the scope of this mailing list or is 
<A HREF="http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/help-whatwg.org">whatwg at whatwg.org</A> more appropriate?
