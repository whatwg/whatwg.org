If even just 3 browsers, IE, Firefox, and Opera, supported OGG as a de
facto HTML standard, and Safari did its own thing, that would still be
a thousand times better than the crap we web developers deal with now.

I really strongly seriously hope to see OGG back in the HTML5 spec,
because that seemed like a such a great path towards eventually being
able to just put videos and audios in web pages without having to deal
with plugins/javascript/etc. Even Flash is still a huge issue,
especially on Linux, and we need something much better than that.

HTML5 was all about making something that web developers could
actually use, instead of the mess that was XHTML2, but if this is the
kind of attitude the WHATWG is going to take towards the specs,
pandering to the browser makers rather than helping the web
developers, then HTML5 is no better than XHTML2 and has become a
me-too attempt.
