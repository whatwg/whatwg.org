You also said the columns weren't lining up with the data:

So I was trying to answer that part of your question.

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, your html has more than 30 errors, including this one:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Warning: A table row was 3 columns wide, which is less than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> column count established by the first row (4).&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Correct that, and the columns may line up the way you'd expect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I posted a small example showing the problem. The 'errors' have
</I>&gt;<i> nothing to do with the issue.
</I>
First: I'm not sure why you put quote marks around &quot;errors&quot;. It's almost
as though you think they're imaginary. They're not. You misspelled
&quot;align&quot; as &quot;aligh&quot; 15 times. That's not the only error.

Second: how do you know that removing the errors won't fix the problem?

&gt;&gt;<i> And please correct the other errors while you're at it, so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debugging is easier and we can provide better help.
</I>
That's the key. When I post your code in my editor, I first have to
correct all your errors before I can start troubleshooting. If you did
that, perhaps the data would line up, and we could focus on the problem
of getting fixed headers and footers on your table.

&gt;<i> But I have found out that by setting display:block on the tbody, I
</I>&gt;<i> essentially remove the &#8220;tableness&#8221;. So I am SOL.
</I>
I'd think some combination of css positioning would do the job. But I'm 
not going to spend time on the css if the underlying html is broken. Too 
many blind alleys.
