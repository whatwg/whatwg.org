</I>
Your interpretation is correct. &lt;ol&gt; would make more sense if the form was 
something like &quot;Enter your selected candidates in the order you prefer to 
have them elected&quot;, or something, in which the order matters.

That's true of every HTML element! :-)


&gt;<i> Semantic markup isn't very useful if most pages use elements in a manner 
</I>&gt;<i> that conflicts with the defined semantics. For example, if a search 
</I>&gt;<i> engine treated dd as enclosing a term being defined, for the purposes of 
</I>&gt;<i> searching for definitions (or excluding defining occurrences from 
</I>&gt;<i> results), it would not find many definitions, and it would misclassify 
</I>&gt;<i> things.
</I>
That's unfortunately true of every HTML element. It doesn't mean semantics 
are useless, though -- with untrusted content, you just have to apply a 
&quot;trust but verify&quot; model, and with trusted content, you can rely on the 
markup being used as specced to a known extent based on the input.


&gt;<i> HTML 4 reflects this in its watered-down, pretty useless &quot;definition&quot; of 
</I>&gt;<i> dl, first calling it a definition list, then saying that dd gives a 
</I>&gt;<i> _description_ (not definition), and ending this with the messy statement 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Another application of DL, for example, is for marking up dialogues, 
</I>&gt;<i> with each DT naming a speaker, and each DD containing his or her words.&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> (Oddly enough, the HTML5 draft explicitly refutes such an idea, beating 
</I>&gt;<i> a dead horse, I would say. If someone has used dl for such a purpose, 
</I>&gt;<i> why should we tell him it's wrong?)
</I>
Conformance requirements are about helping authors write markup in a 
consistent way, e.g. to help them make use of the semantics later.


&gt;<i> &gt; Now, in the new specification,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You misspelled &quot;current draft&quot;.
</I>
Actually the HTML spec is a living standard, not just a draft, at this 
point. The WHATWG doesn't use a &quot;snapshot&quot; mechanim like the W3C; the spec 
is just continually updated in response to feedback, it's not in a &quot;draft&quot; 
stage at the moment (though individual sections are naturally less stable 
than others -- the less stable sections are marked as such in the margins).


&gt;<i> In practice, the dl element has become a layout tool for certain types of
</I>&gt;<i> data. This can hardly be changed any more.
</I>
The same could be said of many HTML elements, like &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, etc. I don't think it's especially useful to give 
up on most of the language just because it's been misused. We'll never be 
able to write a language that _isn't_ misused when we have the scale of 
authors that HTML has.


&gt;<i> Markup for definitions would be something completely different. It's a 
</I>&gt;<i> very complicated issue, much more complicated than the new semantic 
</I>&gt;<i> elements that have been proposed in the HTML5 draft, so it should 
</I>&gt;<i> probably wait for HTML 6, or at least HTML5.1.
</I>
The HTML spec is no longer versioned; there's just a living HTML spec that 
is continually maintained.


&gt;<i> &gt; In HTML5 spec
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current W3C draft for HTML5.
</I>
This is a WHATWG mailing list, so it's generally assumed that we're 
talking about the WHATWG HTML spec, not the W3C copy. (The W3C copy is a 
strict subset of the normative requirements in the HTML spec.)


&gt;<i> The _dangerous_ idea is the obvious implication, explicitly written out 
</I>&gt;<i> in the HTML5 draft, that in a ul element, the order is _not_ 
</I>&gt;<i> significant.
</I>
As you say, it's not an implication, it's the element's standard 
definition.


&gt;<i> This is just absurd. Millions of people have created ul elements without 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that someone else, or maybe a browser, could arbitrarily reorder 
</I>&gt;<i> the items.
</I>
Just because the order isn't material doesn't mean that user agents will 
arbitrarily reorder the items in the list.

</I>
I'd suggest using &lt;p&gt; rather than &lt;div&gt;, but the above is fine per the 
spec, indeed, except that you need id=&quot;&quot; attributes to match the for=&quot;&quot; 
attributes (for=&quot;&quot; refers to id=&quot;&quot;, not name=&quot;&quot;, because the name=&quot;&quot;s 
don't have to be unique).

Indeed, that's another good way of doing it.
