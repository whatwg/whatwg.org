Fair enough. I've added a comment in the spec suggesting that we might 
want to add this at some future point. I haven't added it yet because 
image maps aren't resized that often as far as I can tell and I'm trying 
to not add new features at this point.


&gt;<i> I find this behavior useful enough to have made a limited-case 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript function to supply the desired behavior, which I use in

</I>&gt;<i> generic, clean and easily understood way to rescale maps to new images

</I>&gt;<i> the example has proven to be very useful with floor plans, maps of 
</I>&gt;<i> geographic locations, ... .
</I>
I can imagine it would be quite useful, yes. Have you considered using SVG 
for this kind of thing, by the way?


&gt;<i> PS:  I have been experimenting with replacing the image maps with 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;CANVAS&gt; elements, but found I had to create my own routines to detect 
</I>&gt;<i> if I was in a polygon or not to do so. SVG supports the features I need

</I>&gt;<i> reason to support scaling coordinates; as vector drawings are very well 
</I>&gt;<i> suited to dynamic rescaling (and zooming and clipping, for that matter).
</I>
There's no way to use &lt;map&gt; with &lt;canvas&gt; currently. We will be supporting 
&lt;svg&gt; embedded in the same HTML file though.


&gt;<i> PSS: If you make multiple files displaying differently-sized images of 
</I>&gt;<i> the same &quot;picture&quot;, and put a single &lt;MAP&gt; in another file, experience 
</I>&gt;<i> shows some browsers seem to have trouble with that. If the URI is 
</I>&gt;<i> anything other than a &quot;#NAME&quot; reference, some browsers fail. This means 
</I>&gt;<i> it is much more work to update an imagemap used in multiple documents.
</I>
In HTML5, the usemap=&quot;&quot; attribute is no longer a URI at all (just an ID 
ref with a leading &quot;#&quot; for historical reasons).
