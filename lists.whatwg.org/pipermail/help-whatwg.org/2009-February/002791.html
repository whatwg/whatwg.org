<PRE>The discussion about images sounds like you're slowly re-inventing
PostScript with its inline images. There is an elaborate commenting system,
the Document Structuring Convention, that added more and more information in
these &quot;comments.&quot; Just as things were getting really crazy with the DSC, PDF
came along and solved all those problems in a much cleaner way, and it
pretty much marked the end of hand-written PostScript. (The Acrobat
Distiller compiled PostScript into PDF, and the Acrobat Reader converted PDF
into PostScript for sending to PostScript printers.)
So I second Ian's suggestion to consider SVG, which was a post-PostScript,
post-PDF invention. I'm not familiar with the details of SVG, and in a quick
look at some documents on the Web (e.g., Wikipedia), I didn't see anything
about inline images (image = &quot;raster image,&quot; which is the opposite of
&quot;vector graphics&quot;), or even scalable non-inline images, but perhaps they're
there. In any case, there's already a pretty good wheel; no need to
re-invent it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As most browsers seem to implement them,percent values are useful in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you do not have to redo the coordinates for different sizes of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same image. So if you have a small map for small screens, and a large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one for accessibility purposes or for larger screens, the same &lt;MAP&gt; can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be used without re-doing the coordinates; whereas pixel values
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (currently) need redone for each pixmap file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough. I've added a comment in the spec suggesting that we might
</I>&gt;<i> want to add this at some future point. I haven't added it yet because
</I>&gt;<i> image maps aren't resized that often as far as I can tell and I'm trying
</I>&gt;<i> to not add new features at this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I find this behavior useful enough to have made a limited-case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JavaScript function to supply the desired behavior, which I use in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several projects. But this (seemingly simple?) behavior would make a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generic, clean and easily understood way to rescale maps to new images
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sizes.  I meant the example URI to show the usefulness of such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature; but I might have made the image too simple. The method shown in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the example has proven to be very useful with floor plans, maps of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; geographic locations, ... .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine it would be quite useful, yes. Have you considered using SVG
</I>&gt;<i> for this kind of thing, by the way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS:  I have been experimenting with replacing the image maps with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;CANVAS&gt; elements, but found I had to create my own routines to detect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if I was in a polygon or not to do so. SVG supports the features I need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to make a scaleable vector-based drawing with clippable regions, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requires external files and so on. Am I correct, or is there a way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use MAP and AREA with a CANVAS ? If there is, that would be another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason to support scaling coordinates; as vector drawings are very well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suited to dynamic rescaling (and zooming and clipping, for that matter).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's no way to use &lt;map&gt; with &lt;canvas&gt; currently. We will be supporting
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;svg&gt; embedded in the same HTML file though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PSS: If you make multiple files displaying differently-sized images of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same &quot;picture&quot;, and put a single &lt;MAP&gt; in another file, experience
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shows some browsers seem to have trouble with that. If the URI is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything other than a &quot;#NAME&quot; reference, some browsers fail. This means
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is much more work to update an imagemap used in multiple documents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In HTML5, the usemap=&quot;&quot; attribute is no longer a URI at all (just an ID
</I>&gt;<i> ref with a leading &quot;#&quot; for historical reasons).
