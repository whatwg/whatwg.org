The contents of &lt;article&gt; element is supposed to make sense out of 
context, and this is an essential part of the meaning. At least this my 
understanding of the prose. The &lt;article&gt; element is effectively 
&lt;syndicatable&gt;, but that's too long a word. I guess.

 &gt; To me a
&gt;<i> &quot;user-submitted comment&quot; is not a &quot;self-contained composition&quot;.
</I>
It usually isn't. This is where things get too wild, perhaps. A blog 
post (by a blogger) is expected to be self-contained, syndicatable. But 
comments might me just &quot;Me too!&quot; or &quot;You got it wrong in paragraph two, 
because...&quot;, which surely aren't standalone.

I think &lt;article&gt; elements should be nested only in rare cases, where 
the inner elements are self-contained too. Sometimes a blog comment is 
syndicatable, perhaps more valuable than the original post. But blindly 
marking up all comments as &lt;article&gt;, as the current version suggests 
more or less, goes far too far.

 &gt; Outside
&gt;<i> the context of the original post it often makes little or no sense at
</I>&gt;<i> all. The clarification about nesting goes some way to addressing this
</I>&gt;<i> but not far.
</I>
Now that you say it, it looks rather evident. The question remains which 
markup should be used for blog comments. By answer is to use &lt;div&gt; at 
present. It is better to be semantically empty than semantically all 
wrong. What would happen if a syndication harvester got zillions of 
&quot;article elements&quot; containing just &quot;Me too!&quot;?

Alternatively, the spec could say that an article element inside an 
article element is not necessarily (or usually, to be honest) 
self-contained and syndicatable. The question then arises: What _is_ it?

 &gt; I suspect that
&gt;<i> the reason blog and news posts are used as examples is that they fit
</I>&gt;<i> more intuitively with the name of the tag rather than that the scope of
</I>&gt;<i> the element is limited to them.
</I>
Quite possible; a blog post is an &quot;easy&quot; case, too. But examples should 
really help to understand the meaning better, not state the obvious. A 
difficult task indeed; it is more difficult to present good examples (or 
to set a good example) than to present good theories (or rules).
