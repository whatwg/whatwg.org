<PRE>Hi Yukka,

I agree with your assertion that the nesting of &lt;article&gt; tags does not feel
like the best way to deal with user-submitted content (comments in response
to an article).

I feel that a &lt;response&gt;, or &lt;comment&gt; element would provide valuable
distinction between the original article, and the user-submitted responses.

At the BBC, we do not currently display user-submitted comments to News
article's as nested elements of the main Article container, they appear
further down the page structure. I understand this goes against the
principal of semantic nesting, but it isn't so different from un-nested form
&lt;label&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements. Perhaps an &lt;article name=&quot;article_name&quot;&gt; and
&lt;response to=&quot;article_name&quot;&gt; relationship could be considered?

In the context of a syndication harvester, we would want to make a solid
distinction between the reporter/journalist created Article, and the
public/user created Comments - as there may be legal issue's around
syndication of public/user created Comments.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To me a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;user-submitted comment&quot; is not a &quot;self-contained composition&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It usually isn't. This is where things get too wild, perhaps. A blog

</I>&gt;<i> comments might me just &quot;Me too!&quot; or &quot;You got it wrong in paragraph two,
</I>&gt;<i> because...&quot;, which surely aren't standalone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think &lt;article&gt; elements should be nested only in rare cases, where
</I>&gt;<i> the inner elements are self-contained too. Sometimes a blog comment is
</I>&gt;<i> syndicatable, perhaps more valuable than the original post. But blindly
</I>&gt;<i> marking up all comments as &lt;article&gt;, as the current version suggests
</I>&gt;<i> more or less, goes far too far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Outside
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the context of the original post it often makes little or no sense at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all. The clarification about nesting goes some way to addressing this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but not far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now that you say it, it looks rather evident. The question remains which
</I>&gt;<i> markup should be used for blog comments. By answer is to use &lt;div&gt; at
</I>&gt;<i> present. It is better to be semantically empty than semantically all
</I>&gt;<i> wrong. What would happen if a syndication harvester got zillions of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;article elements&quot; containing just &quot;Me too!&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, the spec could say that an article element inside an
</I>&gt;<i> article element is not necessarily (or usually, to be honest)
</I>&gt;<i> self-contained and syndicatable. The question then arises: What _is_ it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the reason blog and news posts are used as examples is that they fit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more intuitively with the name of the tag rather than that the scope of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the element is limited to them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Quite possible; a blog post is an &quot;easy&quot; case, too. But examples should
