<PRE>Thanks for your response.

I entirely agree. Right now there is little or nothing to be gained from
doing this. However, we have to start somewhere and try to work out what
best practice should be at some point. Now is as good as any. Also, what
benefit one can gain from using these new semantic tags (certainly in terms
of SEO) will partly be determined by how people do actually use them. I
would prefer to get it right and maybe even set a good example than to just
use divs and forget about it until we know what Google wants.


&gt;<i> This means, like for any &lt;article&gt; candidate, that the contents should
</I>&gt;<i> constitute something that is understandable and meaningful out of context.
</I>&gt;<i> It should not imply any of the surrounding content as background. Rather,
</I>&gt;<i> it's something you could print out and hand out or send to a prospective

</I>&gt;<i> handled that way - torn away from a document and copied elsewhere as such
</I>&gt;<i> (or sometimes as annotated).
</I>

This is where I start to have issues with the spec. Are the contents of an
&lt;article&gt; tag supposed to make sense out of context or not? To me a
&quot;user-submitted comment&quot; is not a &quot;self-contained composition&quot;. Outside the
context of the original post it often makes little or no sense at all. The
clarification about nesting goes some way to addressing this but not far.

Maybe it would be useful to add something like the following:



An article element may also consist of product information, place
&gt;<i> description, or data about a person, as long as it is understandable and
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful even when taken out of the context.
</I>

Indeed it would. If that's what the intended meaning was. I suspect that the
reason blog and news posts are used as examples is that they fit more
intuitively with the name of the tag rather than that the scope of the
element is limited to them.
