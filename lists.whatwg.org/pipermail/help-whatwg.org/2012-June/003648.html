<PRE>Hi Brian! Thank you so much for your reply, I really appreciate it. :)

Just to clarify, and sorry if I was not clear before, both of the
examples I posted are for &quot;modules&quot; that will appear in a much larger
page of various pieces of different types of content. :)

</I>&gt;<i> First, your page header. You don't need &lt;header&gt; markup.

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;hgroup&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h1&gt;Bloggers at site.com&lt;/h1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;h2&gt;answering questions that weren't worth asking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;!-- or some such
</I>&gt;<i> thing --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/hgroup&gt;
</I>
Thanks for tips!

Sorry about the redundant subheading. I should have made that more
clear... This is just a &quot;pseudo&quot; example, and I was trying to keep
things concise; I plan on including a more unique subheading for the
real thing; for this example I did not want to go into those types of
specifics. Sorry about the confusion. :(

&gt;<i> &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; itemprop=&quot;url&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> What sort of url is that? If each blogger doesn't have her or his own page,
</I>&gt;<i> how about a real fragment id?
</I>
Hehe, again, sorry for the confusion. I plan on linking to the actual
blogger's blog index pages for the real thing... I was just trying to
keep my example free of clutter.

&gt;<i> Third, your alt text is bogus. Alt text is a *replacement* for the image,
</I>&gt;<i> not a description of it. Since the name appears in the page anyways, next to
</I>&gt;<i> or below the image, the alt attribute should be empty: alt=&quot;&quot;
</I>
Oh, good point! I was wondering about that. That must be a bad habit of mine. :(

I plan on having portrait/mugshots of each blogger for the images;
just out of curiosity, let's say the name was not next to the image...
What would you suggest the ALT text be?

&gt;<i> Finally, if this is an html5 example (is it?), why not use some of the new,
</I>&gt;<i> semantic, markup instead of the generic &lt;div&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, I think figure is more appropriate here.
</I>
Awesome, thanks for tips!

You're totally right, a &lt;figure&gt; appears to work way better! Check out
the latest version:

&lt;<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/2907817">https://gist.github.com/2907817</A>&gt;

... for those interested in comparing, the old version is here:

&lt;<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/2907817/e212ef7c170fd304e51a72a3d5c910604d0d5140">https://gist.github.com/2907817/e212ef7c170fd304e51a72a3d5c910604d0d5140</A>&gt;

Thanks for kicking me in the right direction! :)

&gt;<i> What is the point of this example, anyways?
</I>
Besides wanting to hone my HTML5 skills? :D

I'm in the process of building an HTML5/CSS3/adaptive site for the
company that I work for (a newspaper) and, before I start building the
HTML for the templates, I wanted to run some of my ideas past the
HTML5 gurus (like you).

I hope this list is the right place for these types of questions? I'm
not new to HTML, but I am new to HTML5 (relatively speaking)... If
anyone can recommend a better list for me to ask markup questions,
then I'll gladly go there instead of bothering ya'll. :)

Thanks again for your pro help Brian, I really appreciate it.

Have a nice day.

Cheers,
Micky

P.S. to the group:

I am still interested in feedback on this one:

&quot;HTML5: Marking-up a list of &quot;today's&quot; stories for a mock &quot;section front&quot; page.&quot;
&lt;<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/2907776">https://gist.github.com/2907776</A>&gt;

... that's just mock/pseudo code, so sorry in advance if my attempts
at keep the code lean causes any confusion. Please let me know if I
can clarify anything.
