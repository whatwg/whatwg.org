I asked already in another mail in this thread and maybe you are the one
who could give an answer to this: What would be the general idea of HTML
in your words? What types of content would be marked up with HTML and in
which way? I am just curious.

I know that there must be drawn a line between contents that may be
marked up with HTML and those that don't. But where should that line be
drawn? What would be a reasonable good level to say &#8220;up to this point we
create element types but not beyond&#8221;?

What would qualify as &#8220;a specific reason to ask for a whole new element&#8221;?

For instance: why did you add an &quot;header&quot; element type? What use cases
were brought up to make clear that HTML5 must contain this element type?

It was just logical to me that if you are able to markup quotes then you
should be able to mark up its author too.

I mean I just wanted to know if HTML5 will evolve in case of marking up
quotes (and some more constructs). If it doesn't I will be fine with it.
I will use a Microformat or something else then.


Regards,
Mirko
