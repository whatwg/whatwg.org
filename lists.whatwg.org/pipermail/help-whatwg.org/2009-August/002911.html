HTML is a platform for media-independent, device-independent, and 
multi-vendor content and application delivery over the Internet.


&gt;<i> What types of content would be marked up with HTML and in which way?
</I>
Any media-independent, primarily text-based content or application.


&gt;<i> I know that there must be drawn a line between contents that may be 
</I>&gt;<i> marked up with HTML and those that don't. But where should that line be 
</I>&gt;<i> drawn? What would be a reasonable good level to say &#8220;up to this point 
</I>&gt;<i> we create element types but not beyond&#8221;?
</I>
The general rule is the &quot;80%&quot; rule -- if it would help at least 80% of 
content producers, then it's worth it.


&gt;<i> What would qualify as &#8220;a specific reason to ask for a whole new 
</I>&gt;<i> element&#8221;?
</I>
Having a problem that affects many content producers and which isn't 
solved currently.


&gt;<i> For instance: why did you add an &quot;header&quot; element type? What use cases 
</I>&gt;<i> were brought up to make clear that HTML5 must contain this element type?
</I>
A huge number of sites were doing &lt;div class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;, basically.


&gt;<i> It was just logical to me that if you are able to markup quotes then you 
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to mark up its author too.
</I>
Why? What problem does it solve?
