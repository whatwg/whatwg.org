<PRE>Hey guys,

Dismiss me if I sound like an amatuer but I wanted to make a comment and
follow it with questions (in relation to this topic of course).

Comment:

I have always interpreted &lt;head&gt; to envelop information that the browser
does not present to the user but interprets for the sake of the user
(styles, scripts, meta, etc.). I have always interpreted &lt;body&gt; to envelop
the information that the browser presents directly to the user.

If that is a correct interpretation, I don't think it makes sense to place
navigational links in &lt;head&gt;. Reading this discussion has me wondering if
the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags themselves are not semantically proper. Several
of my peers and I just discussed wether or not both &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; are
slowly becoming the wrong terms to use. No doubt our discussions about
websites are becoming more and more more about &quot;application&quot; and less and
less about &quot;document&quot;. I couldn't help but wonder if &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; are
slowly being deprecated just by the natural progression of the technology.

Questions (in comment form):

Is there any drawbacks or major reasons why &lt;head&gt; could not take on a more
meaningful name like &lt;meta&gt; (Granted that element is already in play but I
wonder if it makes greater sense to have &lt;meta&gt;&lt;/meta&gt; defined as a
&quot;container&quot; for all the information the browser needs to interpret for the
user.

Further, what stipulations or arguments are present for or against &lt;body&gt;
becoming &lt;content&gt;&lt;/content&gt;. At that point, &lt;nav&gt; being placed in the
content are makes sense (as well as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, etc).

A dev team peer had a bit of a different take. He suggested that perhaps any
info that is not direct html content could exist the same way as &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;
and lives &quot;outside&quot; the DOM, while &lt;html&gt; could take the place of &lt;body&gt;.

I do not claim to be an expert by any means and I am most certain that more
knowledgable people exist on this list. I simply wanted to present the
observation and questions for the sake of learning. Feel free to riddle
those observations with bullet holes. I'll learn either way.

</I>&gt;<i> Even links to related pages doesn't make sense to include in the head, as

</I>&gt;<i> In the case where the designers has chosen to make use of it, they would

</I>&gt;<i> Besides. You can't really control where the browser puts the information

</I>&gt;<i> section, you would likely still want to control where it should be placed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So i really don't think its the best way to create links to related stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> It may have its limited use in static documents, but using nav is likely
