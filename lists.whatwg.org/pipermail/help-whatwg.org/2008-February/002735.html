<PRE>I think I made an example that shows the behavior better than I described it 
previously.
I changed the example at
<A HREF="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html</A>
to let you turn off the points in the drawing, render them as circles, 
render them as squares, or render them with a sample marker (just a 
plus-sign, there could
be others).
Essentially, in this example file every polyline is defined as an array. 
Then each array is passed to a JavaScript procedure that draws each array 
with a series of moveTo()
and lineTo() calls. The normal results can be viewed by selecting &quot;no 
points&quot;. Now click on one of the other point options and you will see what I 
consider to be the
missing data appear in the plots. The routine d() behaves the way I was 
asking that &lt;CANVAS&gt; behave. I carried it one step further by adding the 
idea of a
&quot;marker&quot;; if this was done with a CSS style I could imagine something like
canvas{
point-style: none
}
being the default, with other options being &quot;circle&quot;, &quot;box&quot;, and maybe even 
some other marker styles like &quot;diamond&quot; and &quot;plus&quot;';

but I would prefer that the behavior just be the default for &lt;CANVAS&gt; , or 
be controlled with a &lt;CANVAS&gt; style procedure like fillStyle().
If the default changes, I would say one option would be to show points as 
circles if endcaps are rounded, as squares
if endcaps are &quot;square&quot; and null if endcaps are &quot;butt&quot;.

&gt;<i> Yes. I want a circle or square sized relative to the current line width at
</I>&gt;<i> the point;
</I>&gt;<i> depending on what the current linecap style is. The JavaScript procedures 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> example file show a simplified version of the desired behavior -- It just
</I>&gt;<i> does a
</I>&gt;<i> circle, and only handles line segments (2-point lines) not all polylines
</I>&gt;<i> that collapse
</I>&gt;<i> to a point or simple moves (ie any 1-point line). I plan on adding that
</I>&gt;<i> behavior to
</I>&gt;<i> the function to make it a better example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Treating points as (special-case) lines  is such a basic requirement to a
</I>&gt;<i> set of problems
</I>&gt;<i> I have worked with for such a long time, I have forgotten
</I>&gt;<i> how non-intuitive what I'm asking for might seem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rendering points makes a lot of plotting applications a lot simpler.
</I>&gt;<i> Any time your are plotting arbitrary polylines there is the case where you
</I>&gt;<i> have a polyline of zero length (ie. a point).  Lets say you are plotting a
</I>&gt;<i> polyline
</I>&gt;<i> showing the movement of each person in a room. You probably still want to
</I>&gt;<i> show a line
</I>&gt;<i> for the people that did not move. If they moved so much as a single unit
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> will show up; and two different people might use different units (if I
</I>&gt;<i> measure to the
</I>&gt;<i> nearest inch and you measure to the nearest centimeter different people 
</I>&gt;<i> show
</I>&gt;<i> up)!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Points have no visible rendering in a vector space?
</I>&gt;<i> A line is only visible if it has width. Just because a line has no length
</I>&gt;<i> it should
</I>&gt;<i> not necesssarily become invisible. &lt;CANVAS&gt; does not render mathematically
</I>&gt;<i> pure lines
</I>&gt;<i> that only have points as a property. Lines have color and width and 
</I>&gt;<i> linecap
</I>&gt;<i> styles,
</I>&gt;<i> for example. So can points. Those properties can be used to make a point
</I>&gt;<i> show up,
</I>&gt;<i> just like they are used to render a line visibly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Polylines of zero length show up in just about any application where you 
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> representing information with curves. The most common example is probably
</I>&gt;<i> when you are generating an XY plot. I cannot think of a plotting package
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> does not show a line of zero length. If you have any plotting package, 
</I>&gt;<i> give
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> a curve with one point in it. Does it display?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Think of the case where I have a line segment that is becoming shorter and
</I>&gt;<i> shorter.
</I>&gt;<i> When it gets to a length short enough that the rendering canvas sees it's
</I>&gt;<i> endpoints
</I>&gt;<i> as being equal, it vanishes! But vector drawings should be scalable. Yet, 
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> rescale the same plot, the points are far enough apart that lines now 
</I>&gt;<i> appear
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> there was nothing! This is not good behavior for an XY plot, nor for
</I>&gt;<i> packages that
</I>&gt;<i> do technical drawings and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The JavaScript codes in my example plots shows an over-simplifed example 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> what I think should happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) When a line is composed only of a move, or a polyline with all points
</I>&gt;<i> having
</I>&gt;<i>     the same coordinates is encountered, a point should be generated.
</I>&gt;<i> 2)  If the current line caps are rounded, a circle with a diameter equal 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>     current line width should be generated; else a square with an edge
</I>&gt;<i> equal
</I>&gt;<i>     to the current line width should be generated; both should be centered
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i>     the point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The example file contains some simple xy-plots generated from a package 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> supports
</I>&gt;<i> dozens of output devices, including SVG, CGM, PostScript, VML, PPM 
</I>&gt;<i> pixmaps,
</I>&gt;<i> xfig(1), GNU plotutils(1), Tektronix 4014 displays, X11 windows, ...
</I>&gt;<i> When I made a driver for &lt;CANVAS&gt; I had to add conditional code to the
</I>&gt;<i> driver to
</I>&gt;<i> keep short lines and points from disappearing. The reason why is because 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the behavior of  &lt;CANVAS&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> concerning lines it sees as points. The fact that the vast majority of 
</I>&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;<i> output formats do not ignore
</I>&gt;<i> a line of zero length, but show it as a point helps support the idea that
</I>&gt;<i> this would be a useful
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, even if it is optional -- if not for the reasons I mentioned, at
</I>&gt;<i> least for the reason of
</I>&gt;<i> keeping coding simpler for developers supporting multiple vector-format
</I>&gt;<i> outputs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How'd I do?
</I>&gt;<i> Did I get my point across (pun intended)? If not, a picture's worth a
</I>&gt;<i> thousand words. I can make a simple
</I>&gt;<i> application that shows how rendering points avoids odd conditions.  The
</I>&gt;<i> first one would show
</I>&gt;<i> this ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A very thick line with round
</I>&gt;<i> end-caps is drawn along a scale that goes from -1 to 1. One end is fixed 
</I>&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;<i> X=0. The other end
</I>&gt;<i> oscilattes from X=1 to X-1. The line looks
</I>&gt;<i> like a rectangle with rounded ends. As it shortens it starts to look like 
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> circle. Suddenly, it vanishes!
</I>&gt;<i> But then, as it gains a negative length it re-appears as a near-circle 
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> stretches back into the
</I>&gt;<i> rounded rectangle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
