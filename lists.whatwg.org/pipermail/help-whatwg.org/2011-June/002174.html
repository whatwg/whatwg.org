For the same reason &lt;h1&gt; has a phrasing content model while &lt;section&gt; has 
a flow content model.

Indeed.


&gt;<i> The only potential objection that I can imagine for now is that a table 
</I>&gt;<i> header might reasonably act as a tool for sorting or otherwise modifying 
</I>&gt;<i> the data in the table or its rendering. Typically this means just making 
</I>&gt;<i> the header content a link so that e.g. clicking on a particular column 
</I>&gt;<i> header sorts the table so that the column appears in alphabetic or 
</I>&gt;<i> numeric order, and this can be arranged using just text-level markup 
</I>&gt;<i> there (whether we use client-side, server-side, or combined 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of the operation). But would it be possible that someone 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably wanted to use a _form_ in a table header cell? I mean a form 
</I>&gt;<i> where the user selects a sorting criterion, for example. Perhaps in the 
</I>&gt;<i> simplest case, the form might consist of a &lt;select&gt; element and (at 
</I>&gt;<i> least when scripting is disabled) a submit button - but to make it work 
</I>&gt;<i> robustly, with a server-side backup, it would need to be a &lt;form&gt;.
</I>
You can still do that, just have the form outside the table and point to 
it with form=&quot;&quot;.

</I>
This is a very interesting case. (For those who don't want to look at the 
page, these &lt;div&gt;s are being used as inline rich tooltips, basically.)

I'll have to study this case more closely, especially in the context of 
possible new markup for dialog boxes and rich tooltips.

&lt;details&gt; represents a disclosure triangle, which is a similar feature, 
but it's not identical to the rich tooltip thing.

</I>
Yeah.

Alternatively, we could introduce some element that is used to introduce 
data like this, which future ATs would ignore. It wouldn't have a good 
legacy fallback story, unfortunately.
