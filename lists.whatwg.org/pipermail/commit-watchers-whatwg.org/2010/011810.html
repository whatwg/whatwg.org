+   &lt;li&gt;Authors can use the microdata feature (the &lt;code title=attr-item&gt;item=&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code title=attr-itemprop&gt;&lt;a href=#names:-the-itemprop-attribute&gt;itemprop=&quot;&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; attributes) to embed
+   nested name-value pairs of data to be shared with other
+   applications and sites.&lt;/li&gt;
+
+  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=impl&gt;
+
+  &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendor-specific proprietary user agent extensions to this
+  specification are strongly discouraged. Documents must not use such
+  extensions, as doing so reduces interoperability and fragments the
+  user base, allowing only users of specific user agents to access the
+  content in question.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;If such extensions are nonetheless needed, e.g. for experimental
+  purposes, then vendors are strongly urged to use one of the
+  following extension mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;For markup-level features that can be limited to the XML
+  serialization and need not be supported in the HTML serialization,
+  vendors should use the namespace mechanism to define custom
+  namespaces in which the non-standard elements and attributes are
+  supported.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;For markup-level features that are intended for use with
+  &lt;a href=#syntax&gt;the HTML syntax&lt;/a&gt;, extensions should be limited to new
+  attributes of the form &quot;&lt;code title=&quot;&quot;&gt;_&lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;vendor&lt;/var&gt;-&lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, where
+  &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;vendor&lt;/var&gt; is a short string that identifies the
+  vendor responsible for the extension, and &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/var&gt; is the name of the feature. New element names
+  should not be created. Using attributes for such extensions
+  exclusively allows extensions from multiple vendors to co-exist on
+  the same element, which would not be possible with elements. Using
+  the &quot;&lt;code title=&quot;&quot;&gt;_&lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;vendor&lt;/var&gt;-&lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; form allows extensions to be made
+  without risk of conflicting with future additions to the
+  specification.&lt;/p&gt;
+
   &lt;div class=example&gt;
 
+   &lt;p&gt;For instance, a browser named &quot;FerretBrowser&quot; could use &quot;ferret&quot;
+   as a vendor prefix, while a browser named &quot;Mellblom Browser&quot; could
+   use &quot;mb&quot;. If both of these browsers invented extensions that turned
+   elements into scratch-and-sniff areas, an author experimenting with
+   these features could write:&lt;/p&gt;

+      -mb-outputsmell -mb-smell=&quot;lemon juice&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
+
+  &lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;Attribute names starting with a U+005F LOW LINE character (_) are
+  reserved for user agent use and are guaranteed to never be formally
+  added to the HTML language.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p class=note&gt;Pages that use such attributes are by definition
+  non-conforming.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;For DOM extensions, e.g. new methods and IDL attributes, the new
+  members should be prefixed by vendor-specific strings to prevent
+  clashes with future versions of this specification.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;All extensions must be defined so that the use of extensions
+  neither contradicts nor causes the non-conformance of functionality
+  defined in the specification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- thanks to QA Framework --&gt;
+
+  &lt;div class=example&gt;

-  &lt;p&gt;If vendor-specific markup extensions are needed, they should be

-  namespaces. If such DOM extensions are needed, the members should be
-  prefixed by vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future

-  the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes the
-  non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
-  &lt;!-- thanks to QA Framework --&gt;
+  &lt;p&gt;If such extensions are nonetheless needed, e.g. for experimental
+  purposes, then vendors are strongly urged to use one of the
+  following extension mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;p&gt;For markup-level features that can be limited to the XML
+  serialization and need not be supported in the HTML serialization,
+  vendors should use the namespace mechanism to define custom
+  namespaces in which the non-standard elements and attributes are
+  supported.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;For markup-level features that are intended for use with
+  &lt;span&gt;the HTML syntax&lt;/span&gt;, extensions should be limited to new
+  attributes of the form &quot;&lt;code title=&quot;&quot;&gt;_&lt;var
+  title=&quot;&quot;&gt;vendor&lt;/var&gt;-&lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, where
+  &lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;vendor&lt;/var&gt; is a short string that identifies the
+  vendor responsible for the extension, and &lt;var
+  title=&quot;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/var&gt; is the name of the feature. New element names
+  should not be created. Using attributes for such extensions
+  exclusively allows extensions from multiple vendors to co-exist on
+  the same element, which would not be possible with elements. Using
+  the &quot;&lt;code title=&quot;&quot;&gt;_&lt;var title=&quot;&quot;&gt;vendor&lt;/var&gt;-&lt;var
+  title=&quot;&quot;&gt;feature&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; form allows extensions to be made
+  without risk of conflicting with future additions to the
+  specification.&lt;/p&gt;
+
   &lt;div class=&quot;example&quot;&gt;
 
+   &lt;p&gt;For instance, a browser named &quot;FerretBrowser&quot; could use &quot;ferret&quot;
+   as a vendor prefix, while a browser named &quot;Mellblom Browser&quot; could
+   use &quot;mb&quot;. If both of these browsers invented extensions that turned
+   elements into scratch-and-sniff areas, an author experimenting with
+   these features could write:&lt;/p&gt;
+
+   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This smells of lemons!
+&lt;span -ferret-smellovision -fetter-smellcode=&quot;LEM01&quot;
+      -mb-outputsmell -mb-smell=&quot;lemon juice&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
+
+  &lt;/div&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;Attribute names starting with a U+005F LOW LINE character (_) are
+  reserved for user agent use and are guaranteed to never be formally
+  added to the HTML language.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Pages that use such attributes are by definition
+  non-conforming.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;For DOM extensions, e.g. new methods and IDL attributes, the new
+  members should be prefixed by vendor-specific strings to prevent
+  clashes with future versions of this specification.&lt;/p&gt;
