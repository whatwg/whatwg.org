+
+   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage
 comes from the network, but it can also come from script.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/parsing-model-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;The network
 passes data to the Tokeniser stage, which passes data to the Tree
 Construction stage. From there, data goes to both the DOM and to
 Script Execution. Script Execution is linked to the DOM, and, using
 document.write(), passes data to the Tokeniser.&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

+   &lt;p&gt;Here's another example, showing a good solution and a bad solution to
+    the problem of including an image in a description.&lt;/p&gt;
 
-     &lt;p&gt;First, here's the good solution. This sample shows how the
-      alternative text should just be what you would have put in the prose if
-      the image had never existed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 
-     &lt;p&gt;Second, here's the bad solution. In this incorrect way of doing
-      things, the alternative text is simply a description of the image,
-      instead of a textual replacement for the image. It's bad because when
-      the image isn't shown, the text doesn't flow as well as in the first
-      example.&lt;/p&gt;
