+XXXv3 dashed lines have been requested.  Philip Taylor provides these
+notes on what would need to be defined for dashed lines:
+&gt; I don't think it's entirely trivial to add, to the detail that's
+&gt; necessary in a specification. The common graphics APIs (at least
+&gt; Cairo, Quartz and java.awt.Graphics, and any SVG implementation) all
+&gt; have dashes specified by passing an array of dash lengths (alternating
+&gt; on/off), so that should be alright as long as you define what units
+&gt; it's measured in and what happens when you specify an odd number of
+&gt; values and how errors are handled and what happens if you update the
+&gt; array later. But after that, what does it do when stroking multiple
+&gt; subpaths, in terms of offsetting the dashes? When you use strokeRect,
+&gt; where is offset 0? Does moveTo reset the offset? How does it interact
+&gt; with lineCap/lineJoin? All the potential issues need test cases too,
+&gt; and the implementations need to make sure they handle any edge cases
+&gt; that the underlying graphics library does differently. (SVG Tiny 1.2
+&gt; appears to skip some of the problems by leaving things undefined and
+&gt; allowing whatever behaviour the graphics library has.)
