+  &lt;p&gt;The main security and privacy implications of the
+  &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=#video&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=#audio&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements come from the
+  ability to embed media cross-origin. There are two directions that
+  threats can flow: from hostile content to a victim page, and from a
+  hostile page to victim content.&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a victim page embeds hostile content, the threat is that the
+  content might contain scripted code that attempts to interact with
+  the &lt;code&gt;Document&lt;/code&gt; that embeds the content. To avoid this,
+  user agents must ensure that there is no access from the content to
+  the embedding page. In the case of media content that uses DOM
+  concepts, the embedded content must be treated as if it was in its
+  own unrelated &lt;a href=#top-level-browsing-context&gt;top-level browsing context&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;p class=example&gt;For instance, if an SVG animation was embedded in
+  a &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=#video&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, the user agent would not give it
+  access to the DOM of the outer page. From the perspective of scripts
+  in the SVG resource, the SVG file would appear to be in a lone
+  top-level browsing context with no parent.&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a hostile page embeds victom content, the threat is that the
+  embedding page could obtain information from the content that it
+  would not otherwise have access to. The API does expose some
+  information: the existence of the media, its type, its duration, its
+  size, and the performance characteristics of its host. Such
+  information is already potentially problematic, but in practice the
+  same information can more or less be obtained using the
+  &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=#the-img-element&gt;img&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, and so it has been deemed acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;p&gt;However, significantly more sensitive information could be
+  obtained if the user agent further exposes metadata within the
+  content such as subtitles or chapter titles. This version of the API
+  does not expose such information. Future extensions to this API will
+  likely reuse a mechanism such as CORS to check that the embedded
+  content's site has opted in to exposing such information. &lt;a href=#refsCORS&gt;[CORS]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
+  &lt;p class=example&gt;An attacker could trick a user running within a
+  corporate network into visiting a site that attempts to load a video
+  from a previously leaked location on the corporation's intranet. If
+  such a video included confidential plans for a new product, then
+  being able to read the subtitles would present a confidentiality
+  breach.&lt;/p&gt;
