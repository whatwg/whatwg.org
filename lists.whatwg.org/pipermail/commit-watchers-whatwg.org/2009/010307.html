+  &lt;h6&gt;Establishing a connection&lt;/h6&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;There are several options for establishing a Web Socket connection.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;The simplest method is to use port 81 to get a direct connection
+  to a Web Socket server. However, this port may be blocked by
+  firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;The second simplest method is to use TLS encryption and port 815
+  to connect directly to a Web Socket server. This is the preferred
+  solution, as it is secure and correct. However, TLS encryption can
+  be computationally expensive, and port 815 might also be blocked by
+  firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;To avoid firewalls, ports 80 and 443 might be used instead. These
+  are the HTTP and HTTPS ports. Port 80 traffic, however, will often
+  be intercepted by HTTP proxies, which can lead to the connection
+  failing to be established.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;Port 443, using encryption, is therefore the most reliable
+  solution. It is unlikely to be blocked by a firewall or intercepted
+  by a proxy. However, again, TLS encryption can be computationally
+  expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+  &lt;p&gt;When a connection is to be made to a port that is shared by an
+  HTTP server (a situation that is quite likely to occur with traffic
+  to ports 80 and 443), the connection will appear to the HTTP server
+  to be a regular GET request with an Upgrade offer.&lt;/p&gt;
