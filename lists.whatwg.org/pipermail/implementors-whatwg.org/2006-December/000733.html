</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I annonced last week on the WHATWG list, I've started an HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parser in C# (for .NET 2.0).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I finished the tokenizer implementation (coding &quot;blinded&quot;) yesterday
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evening and spent some time today to run the unit tests borrowed from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; html5lib project; and 'know what? apart two or three typos, they all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passed !!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent!
</I>
Actually (please do not laugh !!!), I ran the tests with an incomplete
JSON-&gt;C# test code generator, so unit tests only ran tokenization but
never compared the actual output with the expected one :-D
Worked on that today, there was several small fixes needed in my
tokenization code but now all tests pass.

Some are reported as errors for now because of how I'm &quot;emitting&quot;
tokens. For example, I always report parse errors before the token
currently being parsed is &quot;emitted&quot; (this makes &quot;Unfinished comment&quot;
fail), and I never &quot;emit&quot; a sequence of &quot;Character&quot; tokens (this makes
some tests on entities fail).
Unless someone has a better idea (e.g. changing the test suite), I'll
work on my JSON-&gt;C# test code generator to merge consecutive
&quot;Character&quot; tokens and reorder &quot;ParseError&quot; tokens.

&gt;<i> Be wary though that we have very few tokenizer-specific tests (in the
</I>&gt;<i> current framework some things can only be checked through the parser
</I>&gt;<i> tests [1], but that does not constitute the majority of what is
</I>&gt;<i> missing). So, for example, I don't think the current tokenizer testsuite
</I>&gt;<i> checks that you are lowercasing tag names properly. I believe it is
</I>&gt;<i> highly desirable for the tokenizer tests to, as far as possible, stand
</I>&gt;<i> on their own, and this is something we are looking to improve, so please
</I>&gt;<i> contribute any extra tests you can :)
</I>
I'll run the tests through a code coverage tool and contribute new tests.

&gt;<i> [1] An example of something that, at present  can only be checked
</I>&gt;<i> through a parser test is the proper tokenizing of a fragment like
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;plaintext&gt;&lt;head&gt;&body;
</I>
Which is something within the spec that I still don't have understood&#8230;
but I haven't digg too deep in the tree-construction steps so I might
be missing something&#8230;
