<PRE>Thank you both Martin and Thomas for your feedback. I think the
quickest way around this is
to get our network people to arrange for the firewall exception. I've
looked into it from the
java perspective, there's too much trial and error / research involved
and there are time
constraints.

BTW doing a export _JAVA_OPTS='-Dhttp.proxyPort=myproxy.co.uk
-Dhttp.proxyPort=80' prior
to running the build.py doesn't seem to help either.

So with these firewall exceptions (for outgoing connections on ports
80 and 443) in mind, my question
is now this: to WHICH target hosts on the internet shall we authorise
the exceptions? The
network security people need to know, because naturally (as is their
nature :) they refuse
to set up an exception to &quot;just anywhere&quot;.

Thomas you mentioned various dependencies are needed from
<A HREF="http://www.iana.org">http://www.iana.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets,">http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets,</A>&gt;
... and I could do
a big rgrep and some sedding for <A HREF="http://*">http://*</A> in checker/ to see about
anything else, but there seems
to be so much that I'm not entirely sure where else is relevant in the
massive directory tree under
checker/. I can also see more items being needed (possibly) from
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org,">http://www.w3.org,</A> and <A HREF="http://xml.org,">http://xml.org,</A>
mentions of <A HREF="http://www.apps.ietf.org/,">http://www.apps.ietf.org/,</A> <A HREF="http://www.junit.org,">http://www.junit.org,</A> and
possibly other places from other
directories outside checker/dependencies. Are the problem downloads
solely from .java modules? I would
assume so from what you're saying, but maybe not.

Does anyone have an idea of the exact list of targets, or how to
narrow these down, or shall I just
throw in anything I can find using rgrep/sed? I simply want to avoid
doing a to and fro with our
network people, and make build/py work the first time.

Thanks,

Andrei

I too believe this is a network issue

can
make a local copy and override the URL by setting the
-Dorg.whattf.datatype.charset-registry system property; I don't know
how to set it through build.py though, as I never used it)
