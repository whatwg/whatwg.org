But the spec also defines behavior when elements are outside of the
spec, i.e. an error-condition. I'd appreciate it if the allowed tag
names is made a normative requirement for such elements.

&gt;<i> You may find this post helpful in determining how to read the HTML5
</I>&gt;<i> spec:
</I>
Thanks. I've heard of RFC2119 before, but I didn't realize that
statements of fact that don't use those keywords should not be
considered normative. Many of W3C's specs explicitly state which
statements are normative and which of informative.

&gt;<i> Can you change libxml2 to support more characters? Is there a real 
</I>&gt;<i> technical reason for the limitation, or is it just enforcing XML 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements?
</I>
I've pinged the libxml2 list, should have an answer back soon.

&gt;<i> The characters allowed in tag names are by far not the only area
</I>&gt;<i> where XML and HTML differ, so if it is just a matter of libxml2
</I>&gt;<i> enforcing XML's requirements, it will not work well.
</I>
What are these differences explicitly?

&gt;<i> If you can't implement what the spec requires, then make sure to
</I>&gt;<i> document the limitations clearly in your documentation. Meanwhile,
</I>&gt;<i> you can probably get away with replacing unusable characters with
</I>&gt;<i> U+FFFD,
</I>
Unfortunately, U+FFFD is an invalid character too. :-)

&gt;<i> or at a pinch, &quot;_&quot;, so long as you still use the full tag anems in
</I>&gt;<i> the parser to determine which tags are open. However, make sure to
</I>&gt;<i> document this as being a conformance problem in your documentation.
</I>
This might be tricky, and it occurs to me that as long as the
substitution process works the same for the tags, &lt;a@&gt;t&lt;/a@&gt; becomes
&lt;a_&gt;t&lt;/a_&gt; which is equivalent. I will, of course, document it.

Henri Sivonen:
&gt;<i> With ALTER_INFOSET, tag tokens that do not match Namespaces in XML
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 NCName are ignored in the tokenizer. This is non-conforming but
</I>&gt;<i> works most of the time. (There are many more similar situations you
</I>&gt;<i> can find by searching for ALTER_INFOSET in the source.)
</I>
This is what I had been considering with (2), but it looked like I'd
have to make multiple modifications in the algorithm to get that to
work. I would look at the source, but I can't seem to find it!
All I can find is the build script, and I don't have Python.
