Its name derives from Doktoro Esperanto (&quot;Esperanto&quot; translates as &quot;one who hopes&quot;), the pseudonym under which L. L. Zamenhof published the first book detailing Esperanto, the Unua Libro, on July 26, 1887. Zamenhof's goal was to create an easy-to-learn and politically neutral language that transcends nationality and would foster peace and international understanding between people with different regional and/or national languages.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Estimates of Esperanto speakers range from 10,000 to 2,000,000 active or fluent speakers, as well as perhaps a thousand native speakers, that is, people who learned Esperanto from birth as one of their native languages. Esperanto has a notable presence in over a hundred countries. Usage is highest in Europe, East Asia, and South America. The first World Congress of Esperanto was organized in France in 1905. Since then congresses have been held in various countries every year with the exception of years in which there were world wars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although no country has adopted Esperanto officially, Esperanto was recommended by the French Academy of Sciences in 1921 and recognized in 1954 by UNESCO (which later, in 1985, also recommended it to its member states). In 2007 Esperanto was the 32nd language that adhered to the &quot;Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR)&quot;. Esperanto is currently the language of instruction of the International Academy of Sciences in San Marino.There is evidence that learning Esperanto may provide a superior foundation for learning languages in general, and some primary schools teach it as preparation for learning other foreign languages. On February 22, 2012, Google Translate added Esperanto as its 64th language&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />&lt;h1&gt;How Esperanto Came to be&lt;/h1&gt;<br /><br />&lt;p&gt;The constructed international auxiliary language Esperanto was developed in the 1870s and 80s by L. L. Zamenhof, and first published in 1887. The number of speakers has grown gradually over time, although it has not had much support from governments and international bodies, and has sometimes been outlawed or otherwise suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Zamenhof would later say that he had dreamed of a world language since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Zamenhof taught an early version of the language to his high-school classmates. Then, for several years, he worked on translations and poetry to refine his creation. In 1895 he wrote, &quot;I worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, even though it had seemed to me in 1878 that it was already completely ready.&quot; When he was ready to publish, the Czarist censors would not allow it. Stymied, he spent his time in translating works such as the Bible and Shakespeare. This enforced delay led to continued improvement. In July 1887 he published his Unua Libro (First Book), a basic introduction to the language. This was essentially the language spoken today.&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;llzamenhof.html&quot; &gt;llzamenhof&lt;/a&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br /><br />code for page two:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br /><br />&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;title&gt;L.L Zamenhof&lt;/title&gt;<br />&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;Final.css&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;h1&gt;About the creator&lt;/h1&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<br />L.L. Zamenhof, in full Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, pseudonym Doktoro Esperanto (Esperanto: “Doctor Hopeful”)   (born December 15, 1859, Bialystok, Poland, Russian Empire &#91;now in Poland&#93;—died April 14, 1917, Warsaw), Polish physician and oculist who created the most important of the international artificial languages—Esperanto.<br />A Jew whose family spoke Russian and lived in an environment of racial and national conflict on the Polish-Russian borderland, Zamenhof dedicated himself to promoting tolerance, mainly through the development of an international language. After years of experiment in devising such a tongue, working under the pseudonym of Doktoro Esperanto, he published an expository textbook, Lingvo Internacia (1887; Dr. Esperanto’s International Language). His pseudonym, Esperanto (“&#91;one&#93; who hopes”), was to become the language’s name.<br />In addition to continuing his medical career, Zamenhof worked to develop Esperanto and organize its adherents. The first Esperanto magazine appeared in 1889, the beginnings of formal organization in 1893. With some literary and linguistic skill, Zamenhof developed and tested his new language by translating a large number of works, including the Old Testament, Hamlet, Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales, and plays of Molière, Goethe, and Nikolay Gogol. At the first international Esperanto congress at Boulogne, France (1905), and at successive annual congresses in various European cities, Zamenhof delivered a number of memorable addresses, but he renounced formal leadership of the Esperanto movement at Kraków, Poland, in 1912. His Fundamento de Esperanto (1905; 17th ed., 1979; “Basis of Esperanto”) established the principles of Esperanto structure and formation.&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />&lt;h1&gt;Esperanto&lt;/h1&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Zamenhof's reputation is due to the fact that he is the founder of Esperanto, the new universal language which has taken the place of Volapük. The idea of an international form of speech was suggested to him by the polyglot character of his native town; four different languages were spoken there, and to this fact he attributed the constant dissensions and misunderstandings which disturbed the city. In the gymnasium and at the university he threw himself heart and soul into the study of languages while pursuing his medical work; but the idea of Esperanto did not dawn on him at once. At one time he entertained the idea of mathematical construction, and later the claim of the dead languages, especially Hebrew, appealed to him. For three years he worked at Yiddish and compiled a grammar which is still unpublished, hoping that, since Judæo-German was a modern tongue in use among millions of his coreligionists, it might be universalized. Discarding this idea in its turn, he finally reached the conclusion that no language could ever become a universal medium of communication if it identified itself with any individual nationality or country; it must be neutral. In 1878 he succeeded in building up such a language on the basis of the Romance and Teutonic roots of modern European tongues, but it was not until 1887 that, after several unsuccessful attempts to find a publisher, he gave to the world his first brochure, published anonymously under the pen-name of &quot;Doktoro Esperanto&quot; (Dr. Hopeful).&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;esperanto.gif&quot; alt=&quot;esperanto&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;309&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br /><br />And code for my CSS:<br /><br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>body<br />{<br />    Background-color : black;<br />    Font-family : sans-serif;<br />    Font-style : normal;<br />    Font-size : medium;<br />    Font : Times New Roman;<br />    Color : lime;<br />    Text-align : left;<br />    Text-indent : 5px;<br />    Margin-right : 50px;<br />    Line-height : normal;<br />}<br />h1<br />{<br />    Font-family : sans-serif;<br />    Font-size : 40px;<br />    Font : Courier , Verdana;<br />    Color : fuchsia;<br />    Font-style : normal;<br />}<br />a:link<br />{<br />    Color : yellow;<br />}<br />a:visited<br />{<br />    Color : aqua;<br />}<br />a:active<br />{<br />}<br /></code></dd></dl><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3701">dbyrns</a> — Fri Dec 14, 2012 1:35 am</p><hr />
