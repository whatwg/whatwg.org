I don't think HTML 5 should propose or require any codec at all. I think HTML 5 should stick with a good method for allowing the use of any codec without forcing or even suggesting one.<br /><br />Unless I was mislead (which is quite possible), Firefox will have both Vorbis (audio codec) and Theodora (video codec). Both are patent-free, royalty-free, and available as free software.<br /><br />The only reason why MP3 caught up and became the de facto audio codec back in the mid-90s is because it was mature and ready just in time for the new multimedia boom. Even tough free implementations exist now, MP3 is in fact a closed format. However, several better algorithms have been developed since then. Some of them are general (Vorbis and Theodora are good examples) while others are more specialized.<br /><br />While different browsers will have a different opinion about what codec should be included, I hope that somehow at least one will become standard enough that it will be safe to use. I hope Vorbis and Theodora will be those, but only time will tell. And since I'm not an expert, perhaps something better already exists which I don't know of yet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=449">Tom Duhamel</a> — Tue May 26, 2009 8:20 pm</p><hr />

Ogg is a container for various media formats (I hate the fact that they all have an ogg extension since I use different media players for video and audio). The Vorbis audio format is a very good patent-free audio format that is on par, and perhaps even superior to mp3. Theora for video, on the other hand, is not even close to modern video formats, so I would say yay for Ogg Vorbis and nay for Ogg Theora. Unfortunately, that leaves us with very few choices for video.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=377">lyosha</a> — Fri Mar 06, 2009 10:51 pm</p><hr />

I <span style="font-style: italic">would like</span> for the mp3 format to be implemented in it - but I would not like to have to pay for it or see my favourite browser vendor have to pay for it.<br /><br />Given that and a few other concerns, I'd <span style="font-style: italic">prefer</span> see some other format instead. I don't know a lot about Ogg but the inclusion of Ogg codecs in Fedora leads me to believe that it's patent-free or royalty free or whatever. Also it can be tuned for high compression and/or reasonable quality. Ogg seems like a good choice.<br /><br />Even if he got the name of the format wrong (MP3? Really? Would that be wise or would it &quot;close&quot; the internet?) I take from it that nobody seems to be able to agree on the video.<br />If Ogg provides the same advanatages in video as what I think that it does in audio, then I think that I would choose Ogg for video as well.<br /><br />After saying all that, I confess I know next to nothing about codecs. I would like something:<br />- which is not and can not be tied to patents or anything like that in any country<br />- which everyone can use for free forever<br />- which offers good compression<br />- which offers good quality<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=402">SneakyWho_am_i</a> — Mon Mar 02, 2009 11:27 am</p><hr />

It's not clear that everyone does agree that audio should support MP3. In fact the spec only requires WAV support for audio, and doesn't even mention MP3 as far as I can tell.<br /><br />I think Kevin's statement isn't meant to imply that any particular format is settled for audio, but rather that finding a suitable audio codec is simpler than finding a suitable video codec.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Sat Mar 15, 2008 11:32 am</p><hr />

Mr Kevin Carlson disclosed the following information to the general public:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />everyone involved can agree that the audio element should support MP3<br /></div></blockquote><br />where &quot;everyone involved&quot; means &quot;in WHATWG&quot;.  <br /><br />Please somebody stand up and correct this by telling the author and the editor.  It is not true at present but publications like Dr Dobb's Journal are quite influential; the whole matter can be perceived as an attempt to influence the group's decision by telling everybody else what decision the group is going to take.<br /><br />I am no person to refute the incriminated statement because I am not particularly interested in streaming media.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ddj.com/web-development/206902334?cid=RSSfeed_DDJ_All" class="postlink">http://www.ddj.com/web-development/206902334?cid=RSSfeed_DDJ_All</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=266">yecril71pl</a> — Fri Mar 14, 2008 5:20 pm</p><hr />
