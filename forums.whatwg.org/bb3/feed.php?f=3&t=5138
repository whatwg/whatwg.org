HTML5 is hyped to make the web-technology support the features you need for web-applications easily out of the box.<br />And truly the improvements and new features are really nice and manifold.<br /><br />However, there is such a common thing that is a major key to reasonable web-applications that seems to be still in the same rotten state since years - the <span style="font-weight: bold">table for displaying rows of data</span>. You need at least the following features, just to mention a few:<br /><ul><li>Support for scrolling tbody vertically as needed and the entire table horizontally.</li><li>Ideally also support for fixed/frozen columns that do not scroll horizontally and remain steady (just as fixation of the window in excel).</li><li>Abilitly for the user to sort by column</li><li>Ability for the user to resize columns (with e-resize cursor on the fly by dragging the right border of the column)</li><li>Ability to scale the size of the entire table with the available size (without javascript layout managers)</li><li>Ability for the user to reorder columns with drag and drop</li><li>Ability for inline editing</li><li>For large datasets it may be required that you only render the visible part and update lazily while scrolling</li><li>Ability for multiple selection with checkboxes</li><li>Keyboard support to step through the column headers and cells with cursor keys</li><li>Accessibility support via WAI-ARIA</li><li>...</li></ul><br />To archive this you need tons of javascript and CSS. There is no feature complete solution available that is truly free (e.g. Apache Software Licensed). Most solutions I have seen so far have only a very limited feature set or are buggy.<br /><br />Further, to make it work you have to heavily rely on hacks and workarounds.<br />Already for the feature 1. you will discover evil pain to make it happen while the spec says that TBODY has been introduced for this purpose:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#idx-row_group">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tab ... -row_group</a><!-- m --><br />However, it is simply not working in any browser by just assigning a fixed heigth and y-overflow: auto to tbody. It used to work in older FF versions but has been removed to be compatible with the &quot;standard&quot;. The only solution is to rely on hacks (&quot;display: block&quot; and assigning fixed width to everything, etc.).<br />If all these features would be properly supported by the standard itself in a semantic and expressive way there would also be high chances for advanced usability across different devices, screen-resolutions, etc. and for advanced accessibility for users of screen-readers, etc.<br /><br />Is there anything to expect in the next future on this topic? Or am I just missing some magic new features?<br /><br />Cheers<br />  Jörg<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3760">hohwille</a> — Wed Apr 03, 2013 8:09 pm</p><hr />
