I think the reason the workers spec only allows URLs currently is because of a desire to keep things simple for the first version, and then add stuff later if there's demand.<br /><br />I agree that it would be nice, and have suggested that same-document workers should be supported:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-September/023138.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatw ... 23138.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />editor's response:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-October/023588.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatw ... 23588.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Opera's (not yet publicly available) implementation currently supports data: URLs in the constructors.<br /><br />Doing a function clone seems a bit scary, but I haven't given it much thought. It would certainly be elegant if it worked. Maybe you could suggest this to the whatwg list?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Wed Dec 16, 2009 12:14 pm</p><hr />

A reply of &quot;Sorry, we thought about this longer than you did, and there are still cases where this is impossible&quot; is perfectly valid, but the more I can learn from this conversation, the better.</span><br /><br />Would it be possible to do a deep copy of the function (object) you pass to the the constructor? So copy everything (or mark it for copy-on-write), but remove references to DOM elements if they exist. This way, I think you can create a parallel data structure, so the original one remains untouched (avoiding concurrency issues).<br /><br />The important difference between this and the usual JSON-serializing of objects that the examples talk about, is that functions can be passed through too in an easy manner. If you have to simulate this using only Javascript, you have to somehow bind the free variables, which requires some introspection, and thus is not easy (if even possible?) to simulate in &quot;user space&quot;.<br /><br />The Google Gears API seems to provide both <span style="font-style: italic">createWorker(scriptText)</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">createWorkerFromUrl(scriptUrl)</span>. Why was only the URL variant retained in the Web Workers spec? With the script variant, there would have been at least a little basis for more dynamic programming.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=799">cheezy</a> — Wed Dec 16, 2009 9:15 am</p><hr />
