Thanks for sending these links, it's an interesting insight into the process.<br /><br />I'm familiar with 2119.  For the HTML5 spec, I should note that today I have been looking at the W3C version  because I can't access it from the whatwg.org site.  I thought that what I had read in recent days in the whatwg.org spec said that Ogg Vorbis and Theora was required, but the W3C version seems to indicate that it isn't.  Is their version different than the whatwg version?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>zcorpan wrote:</cite><br />They are required, unless you have a really good reason not to support them (see RFC 2119).<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />At current, on the W3C version of the spec under video codec [1] says Theora and Vorbis are SHOULDs.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>zcorpan wrote:</cite><br />WAV is a SHOULD requirement just like the video formats.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />At current, on the W3C version of the spec under audio codec [2] says WAV is a MUST.<br /><br />[1] <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#video0">http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#video0</a><!-- m --><br />[2] <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#audio0">http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#audio0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Hopefully this can get clarified in favor of Theora and Vorbis being required.<br /><br />Thanks, and I'll leave you alone now! <br />Clay <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=163">wattsferry</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2007 6:43 pm</p><hr />

Hi all,<br /><br />I see that Ogg Theora and Ogg Vorbis will be the default supported format for the video element.  For the audio element the spec says that WAV will be the supported format, which is great, but seems somewhat counterintuitive to me given the already defined support for Ogg.  <br /><br />I confused on how this will work, but based on the Ogg Vorbis libraries already living in the codebase to support the video element, will the audio element also provide playback for Ogg Vorbis files?  I hope this is the case.<br /><br />Also, does anyone know if any further discussion of supporting Speex has occurred?  I see from the post on the listserv [1] that this has been discussed.  It seems that adding Speex support should be straightforward too -- actually I'd hope adding any of the xiph.org projects could be possible.  Wrapping a FLAC file in Ogg, for instance, would be a great complement (or alternative) to providing WAV given the smaller file size.<br /><br />[1] <a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-May/011515.html" class="postlink">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-May/011515.html</a><br /><br />Thanks for any answers you might have,<br />Clay<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=163">wattsferry</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2007 2:42 pm</p><hr />
