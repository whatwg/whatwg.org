Back then browsers competed by introducing new features ad-hoc without standardization. Today we're working together and going through the standards process before or at the same time as the new features are implemented, for the good of the Web and to foster interoperability between browsers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Wed Jul 02, 2008 9:03 pm</p><hr />
