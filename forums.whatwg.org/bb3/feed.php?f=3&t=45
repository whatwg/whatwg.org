I think there are multiple problems with your proposal.<br /><br />1. It's a theoretical problem. Catering for possible future scripting languages before they exist isn't useful, because you don't know what the needs are should a new scripting language get into use.<br /><br />2. It's harder to get interop between implementors when the processing rules are more complicated. We don't quite have interop today wrt noscript handling, so complicating matters more doesn't help to achieve interop.<br /><br />3. Even with only JS, there is seldom a <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> to use noscript (see <a href="http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?t=38&amp;start=15#199" class="postlink">the XHR example</a> in the other thread). If a new scripting language is introduced, it can deal with fallback itself without &lt;noscript&gt;.<br /><br />4. Noscript elements can't be nested not for theoretical reasons but for practical reasons. When a noscript is &quot;ignored&quot;, it means that it is parsed as CDATA, which means that the first matching end tag will close the element. So it really cannot be nested.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Tue May 01, 2007 12:12 am</p><hr />

A problem that affected us somewhat during the IE/Netscape browser wars and which could conceivabley happen again is that a user agent may support some but not all of the scripting languages used by a web application. This was most obvious when Microsoft were pushing for VBScript/JScript support early this decade. There is no reason that, if additional scripting languages for the web were developed, that they could be expected to be universally supported overnight.<br /><br />I would propose that the &lt;noscript&gt; tag has an optional &quot;type&quot; element, which, if specified, would cause the &lt;noscript&gt; tag to be ignored only if the user agent supports and is configured to run scripts of the type requested.<br /><br />For example, a code block beginning &lt;noscript type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; would only be displayed if the user agent did not support JavaScript, or JavaScript was turned off. The browser would still, potentially, execute other script types.<br /><br />The ultimate aim of this would be to provide future-proof web applications as (and if) new scripting languages become available, by providing less-ideal fallback languages during the migration period. For example, if a new scripting language (represented here by a fictional language served as type &quot;text/supernewlanguage&quot;), both effecient new supernewlanguage and fallback retro javascript support could be provided with the following code:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/supernewlanguage&quot;&gt;<br />  // supernewlanguage is supported<br />  superNewLanguageCode&#40;&#41;;<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />&lt;noscript type=&quot;text/supernewlanguage&quot;&gt;<br />  &lt;!-- supernewlanguage is not supported --&gt;<br />  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />    // javascript alternative<br />    javascript_alternative&#40;&#41;;<br />    more_code_for_js_alternative&#40;&#41;;<br />  &lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />  &lt;noscript type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />    &lt;!-- javascript isn't supported either --&gt;<br />    &lt;p&gt;<br />      I'm sorry, but javascript support &#40;or, better yet, super<br />      new language support&#41; is required to use this web<br />      application.<br />    &lt;/p&gt;<br />  &lt;/noscript&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/noscript&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />This could, of course, be extended as deep as is necessary. This provides the capability for sites to be backwards compatible as new languages are made available.<br /><br />Unfortunately, such a change would require several changes to the specification, including the permitting of embedding &lt;noscript&gt; tags.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=85">avapoet</a> — Mon Apr 30, 2007 8:16 am</p><hr />
