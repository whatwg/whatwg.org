Putting script at the end of a body section is useful, but is only a convention. It doesn't guarantee that anything will be displayed by a browser before the script is loaded / run.<br /><br />By moving the script to another section outside of &lt;body&gt; we are effectively telling any browser that this is <span style="text-decoration: underline">definitely not</span> needed for display and can safety be delayed till after the main &lt;body&gt; has completed.<br /><br />The page should display quicker (and therefore appear to load quicker) simply because it is only doing what it needs to. There shouldn't be any additional processing, just a re-ordering of what it would have done anyway.<br /><br /><br />(I think it's useful to think of the HTML document as having a pre-display section (&lt;head&gt;) and a post-display section (&lt;foot&gt;).)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1209">akademy</a> — Tue May 25, 2010 10:53 am</p><hr />

How would a &lt;foot&gt; section gain speed compared to just putting the &lt;script&gt;s last in &lt;body&gt;? It seems to me it would be slightly slower since you have to transfer more bytes over the wire to include the &lt;foot&gt; tag and more processing to parse it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Tue May 25, 2010 8:38 am</p><hr />

<span style="font-weight: bold">1. What is the problem you are trying to solve? </span><br />Improve load times of webpages that have many additional include files. <br /><br />For instance many websites now include JavaScript libraries that are only included to enhance the interfaces but are not needed for the body portion to be presented. Other websites include a list of CSS files that can be switched too after the main one is loaded.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. What is the feature you are suggesting to help solve it? </span><br />We could let authors choose which parts are not crucial to the main body, and can be saftely loaded / run after the page has been displayed. <br /><br />This could be done by having at &lt;foot&gt; section, after the body section:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;html&gt;<br />&lt;head&gt;&lt;!-- Essential parts needed for page --&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br />&lt;body&gt;&lt;!-- Essential display parts --&gt;&lt;/body&gt;<br />&lt;foot&gt;<br />&lt;!-- Enhancements to display --&gt;<br />&lt;/foot&gt;<br />&lt;/html&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />(It also has a pleasing symmetry about it...)<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3. What is the processing model for that feature, including error handling? </span><br />&lt;head&gt; is read, &lt;body&gt; is read. Browser then deduces how to display the information. &lt;foot&gt; is read and interface changes accordingly.<br /><br />I believe most older browsers would just append the foot section to the body's DOM, and therefore pages will still act the same as before.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4. Why do you think browsers would implement this feature? </span><br />Better speed for displaying of content, with minimal extra effort.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5. Why do you think authors would use this feature?</span> <br />Better speed for displaying of content, and better control of when javascript (and the like) will be implemented by browsers.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6. What evidence is there that this feature is desparately needed?</span><br />Little, but the number of javascript includes is ever rising.<br /><br />The eventual adoption of HTML5 by web designers and increasing use of the canvas element over such things as flash will obviously increase the use of javascript and their libraries (jQuery, prototype etc.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1209">akademy</a> — Mon May 24, 2010 4:03 pm</p><hr />
