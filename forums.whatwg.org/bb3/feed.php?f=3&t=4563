I was told by a friend at google that this is where the real action occurs.<br /><br />Recently I have been trying to get VideoJS as our default HTML5 Video player on <a href="http://twitvid.com" class="postlink">http://twitvid.com</a>, but in a number of situations we are having to fall back to flash, and it seems like that number is growing unnecessarily for features like fullscreen.<br /><br />We tried to use the new Fullscreen API as is provided in Firefox and Webkit ( Chrome/ Safari ), however there are performance issues and we are having issues with iFrames.  ( on a performance note this will get better with time. )<br /><br />As for the iFrame, issue it does not seem possible to take a &lt;video&gt; fullscreen from within an iFrame.  The example is easily seen on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/twitvid" class="postlink">https://twitter.com/#!/search/twitvid</a>.  What happens instead is that the video goes full window within the iFrame.<br /><br />To solve the problem, we could either go back to a default flash player in all embeds ( half of our traffic ), or we could do a two click flow for users to go fullscreen.  Neither is ideal, and honestly we might default to flash as the preferred option.<br /><br />In the two click option a user might click an HTML element that then renders the flash video with a modal confirming the user wants to go fullscreen, to capture a click within flash's user click chain so that flash can go fullscreen.<br /><br />In cases like these it would be nice if the user click chain stayed intact between plugin and browser, but that is a harder fish to fry.<br /><br />In this case we can not add attributes to all of the iframes that are in the wild so, that is an issue as well, we might be able to get twitter to change their iframe code for us, but that does not solve all cases, and how would the child frame know that it has that privilege?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3488">jdavid</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2012 5:03 pm</p><hr />

<blockquote><div><cite>Xdega wrote:</cite><br />For example having a fallback when the user want's to access full screen (I don't believe a majority use full screen full screen).<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />There are alternatives. For example, popups open automatically are hide by the browser, but popups activated by a click don't. So the browser can control that the fullscreen was requested by the user and not automatically activated. The ESC key is already known as a way out, therefore force that key in the fullscreen mode to be exclusive for fullscreen mode deactivation shouldn't be difficult to do (I suppose, it's just a suggestion).<br />When I use the HTML5 version of YouTube I have to go back to the &quot;normal&quot; version because I don't have fullscreen available. And the fallback solution is not possible, first HTML5 was developed to eliminate plugins like flash, and second the fallback occurs before the user interacts with the application, so is not possible to know if he is going to need full screen or not. And other point is that fallback is only possible for videos, you can't fallback in an HTML5 game or application.<br /><br />JD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">macrojd</a> — Sat Mar 12, 2011 7:28 pm</p><hr />

As long as some kind of user interaction is <span style="font-weight: bold">required</span> to initiate full screen mode, then it's fine and dandy. <br />But key thing &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">required</span>&quot;.

Maybe you didn't try to sound like that, but you did.<br /><br />About Flash, well, doesn't matter if it's still superior or not, we are talking about the future, about implement things for the next years and in my message (you should also read more carefully as well) I was talking about applications for the next few years (I used this two words exactly).<br /><br />So, full screen is ABSOLUTELY necessary for the future and (as I also said in the first message) it is also necessary for some applications running today (like the HTML5 version of YouTube for example).<br /><br />So, insults apart, go and read, you will be surprise about how you can already do with HTML5 and you will see how necessary is a full screen mode. NOBODY was talking about forcing anyone, I have no idea why that became an issue in this discussion. The feature that we need to implement is the ability to go full screen mode by code. I repeat, you don't have to press F11 to go full screen in a Flash application, the same has to be available in HTML5 or the applications and games in a few years will looking ridiculous. Flash doesn't force anyone to go full screen, HTML5 shouldn't do it neither, that's out of the question.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that the HTML5 developers will come to their senses and implement a full screen mode, I'm just trying to push things forward. Time will give me the reason, not have a full screen interface will be just a nonsense in short time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">macrojd</a> — Sat Mar 12, 2011 7:27 am</p><hr />

Did you ever try to press F11 on your keyboard while browsing some web page?<br /><br />Aside from that, i don't really see why this would be useful. HTML is not complex, its a simple text-based markup language, and its not powerful enough to build what you describe, and likely never will be.<br /><br />If something like this ever was implemented, it would need to be implemented in a way that you couldn't really use it as you intended anyway, because it would lead to abuse by Internet fraudsters and advertisers. You might as well just tell your users to hit the &quot;F11&quot; key on their keyboard, (most won't like it anyway).<br /><br />You see most flash games, etc, has the ability to go full-screen on the users request. But doesn't force the user into full-screen mode. <br /><br />Besides, there are already other, much more suitable programming languages and tools, to create full screen apps.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1729">BlueBoden</a> — Sat Mar 05, 2011 1:16 am</p><hr />
