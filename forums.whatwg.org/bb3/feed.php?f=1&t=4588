I'm against Microsoft's anti-GUI antics however I have no problem giving credit where credit is due and things such as favicons and AJAX have come from Microsoft. If keeping IE around means more potential awesomeness in the future I say keep the browser and migrate users to more modern browsers. IE9 still is not enough though it does put IE10 in the <span style="font-style: italic">potential</span> for some serious donkey kicking if they play their cards right. I think it'll be a bit of a mixed bag though with the politics as in example Opera 11.5 has full hardware support across all platforms while Microsoft is relying on DirectX which I've read is the bane of most video game developers due to overhead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Wed Mar 30, 2011 8:05 am</p><hr />

I mean IE appears to be the bane of web development, why does it even exist? How does Microsoft get away with this?

You should run copies of XP in a virtual environment (e.g. virtualization). You can <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> run standalone copies of Internet Explorer.

1.) The border-radius property is CSS, it is not HTML, it is a CSS <span style="font-style: italic">property</span>.<br /><br />2.) There are not &quot;tags&quot; in HTML, there are elements (e.g. &lt;element attribute=&quot;value&quot; attribute=&quot;value&quot; /&gt;).<br /><br />3.) There is no way to code border-radius in Internet Explorer 8 or older, to have rounded corners you would have to use graphical hacks.<br /><br />4.) Don't use graphical hacks, IE8 and older will be disappearing over time and the time to implement the graphical hacks will have quickly decreasing benefits.<br /><br />5.) People using Internet Explorer in general will very likely <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> notice rounded corners.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Sat Mar 26, 2011 6:55 pm</p><hr />

Here's my opinion, and it's just an opinion. I choose not to support anything older than IE8 for my personal projects, but I am a student and not officially working in the field yet. I do also include the following footer:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />This website makes extensive use of new web based technologies and coding. <br />We recomend that you make sure you are running the latest version of your current web browser.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Obviously in a career scenario, whatever a paying client wants should be considered providing the price is right for the extra time involved. If you answer to a boss, I suppose you wouldn't have a choice on the matter (besides arguing your point). <br /><br />IE9 thankfully supports a lot of new features, and as such I think it is definitely fair to bring IE9 on board as a browser you should attempt to cater for.<br /><br />Ultimately though with any project, you should ask yourself if a particular element  is really needed and relevant to the project. There's nothing worse than people just slapping on drop shadows and rounded edges for no apparent design reason than &quot;because they can&quot;.<br /><br />my 2c<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Fri Mar 25, 2011 8:39 pm</p><hr />

I would be interested to know folks general attitude to this? - do you cater to the Nth degree for IE? - take the attitude that it may not look 100% the same in IE, but it works fine? - or only if the client requests, and then up the fee? (or not?)<br /><br />I'm not talking <span style="text-decoration: underline">only</span> about border-radius, (and IE6 discussion seems to have played out a while back now, so IE7/8/9 focus) but this seems like an opportunity to ask<br /><br />Interesting...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1700">freeTinker</a> — Fri Mar 25, 2011 7:14 am</p><hr />

Well IE9 has native support for that element.

Ok, this far I was amazed at the power of HTML5, but it wasn't until I started using the border-radius tag. I've implemented the Google shim code and yes it did solve some of my problems [if I want to stick to a shoe-box type layout], but what if I decide to use the border radius command? It renders correctly in Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome of course with the use of -webkit, and -moz attributes, but is there anything out there for for the older IE browsers? <br /><br />I don't want to use to many java-script hacks if possible just incase there's people using mobile phones to access my web site...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1844">nuevolutionWd</a> — Thu Mar 24, 2011 8:11 am</p><hr />
