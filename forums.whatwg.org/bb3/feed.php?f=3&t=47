My apologies on bringing this back from the dead, but there is new... evidence, so to speak.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>zcorpan wrote:</cite><br />Wouldn't a new pseudo-element, say ::key-value-group, solve the styling problem?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />As I mentioned in #whatwg on freenode, it isn't enough. Let's say I have the following definition list:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;dl&gt;<br />&lt;dt&gt;term 1&lt;/dt&gt;<br />&lt;dd&gt;<br /> &lt;dl&gt;<br />  &lt;dt&gt;term 1-1&lt;/dt&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;def 1-1-1&lt;/dd&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;def 1-1-2&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;/dl&gt;<br />&lt;/dd&gt;<br />&lt;dd&gt;<br /> &lt;dl&gt;<br />  &lt;dt&gt;term 1-2&lt;/dt&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;def 1-2-1&lt;/dd&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;def 1-2-2&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;/dl&gt;<br />&lt;/dd&gt;<br />&lt;dt&gt;term 2&lt;/dt&gt;<br />&lt;dd&gt;<br /> &lt;dl&gt;<br />  &lt;dt&gt;term 2-1&lt;/dt&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;def 2-1-1&lt;/dd&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;def 2-1-2&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;/dl&gt;<br />&lt;/dd&gt;<br />&lt;/dl&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br /><br />Okay. Now that we have that, let's add some styles to it.<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>dl &#123;font-family:verdana;font-size:.8em;width:500px;padding:0;margin:0 auto;border:1px solid #000;&#125;<br />dt &#123;margin:.2em;padding:.2em;background:#000;color:#fff;&#125;<br />dd &#123;margin:.5em;padding:0;&#125;<br />dl dl &#123;width:auto;font-size:1em;&#125;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />The DTs have black backgrounds and the DLs have black borders. Now, how do we separate the definition sets? Well, this should be easy. Let's try the :last-child selector.<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>body &gt; dl &gt; dd:last-child &#123;border-bottom:5px solid #f00;&#125;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />This does exactly what it's supposed to (style-wise). It adds a 5 pixel border under the last dd child in the definition list. This isn't very helpful since we're looking for the last definition of each definition term. This means it is <span style="font-weight: bold">not a styling problem</span>, but rather a structure problem. The addition of a definition group tag would allow for this to be done. We could still do the 5px red border at the very bottom of the list by adding the :last-child selector to the definition group tag rather than the dd tag. The current spec makes it impossible (without hacks of course) to do this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">bfrohs</a> — Wed Sep 17, 2008 9:43 am</p><hr />

After reading the HTML5 spec on tables, I have found that this setup might be a decent alternative solution:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;table&gt;<br />&lt;tr&gt;<br />   &lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;value&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;/tr&gt;<br />&lt;tr&gt;<br />   &lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;value&lt;/td&gt;<br />&lt;/tr&gt;<br />&lt;/table&gt;<br /></code></dd></dl><br /><br />And one could use CSS to display elements as block, inline, or whatever is preferred. Unfortunately Internet Explorer is currently NOT able to do so, but then IE compatibility would probably be an issue with any other suggestion. <br /><br />Can anyone see any other problem with this solution?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=209">Fyrd</a> — Mon Dec 10, 2007 2:42 pm</p><hr />

So it's semantically inappropriate. <br /><br />I guess instead one might create some kind of &lt;dfn&gt;&lt;key&gt;&lt;/key&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/dfn&gt; system, which could work independantly or inside a list. As an added bonus that give a way of displaying a single key/value pair, without <span style="font-style: italic">requiring</span> to be in a list.

<blockquote><div><cite>Cerbera wrote:</cite><br />And what about <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>s then? Shall we call those deprecated as well, since adding <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;legends&gt;</span> to a form already implies the start of a new group of form fields as well in the same manner as a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span> does within a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dl&gt;</span>. Even more perhaps as only one <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;legend&gt;</span> is allowed per group which is not the case for <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span>s.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />There is a key difference between <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span> and the proposed <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span>. <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dd&gt;</span> elements are automatically and unambiguously associated with each other. A group of one or more contiguous <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span> elements are defined by a group of one or more contiguous <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dd&gt;</span> elements. The association is terminated by either another <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span> element or the closing <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;/dl&gt;</span> tag.<br /><br />You don't get that with elements in a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;form&gt;</span>. Form elements may be grouped together, as in a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>, or may be stand-alone items that are not grouped with any others. So while a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;legend&gt;</span> element will implicitly begin a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>, and in doing so terminate a previous unclosed <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>, there will often be times when you need to close a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span> without beginning a new one.<br /><br />Consider the following form structure:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;form&gt;<br />Name<br />&lt;fieldset&gt;&lt;legend&gt;Address&lt;/legend&gt;<br />Address 1<br />Address 2<br />Town<br />Postcode<br />Country<br />&lt;/fieldset&gt;<br />Age<br />&lt;/form&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />If you're not allowed <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span> elements, you can't separate off the &quot;age&quot; field at the end from the preceding &quot;address&quot; fields, other than by inserting a (completely unnecessary) <span style="font-style: italic">legend</span>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=114">Stevie D</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2007 12:32 pm</p><hr />

In my opinion, if you want (X)HTML 5 to truly help the web, backward-compatibility will have to be broken somewhere. There is always talk of things that would make it more organized, but everyone is too scared to break backward-compatibility because it might affect users with older browsers. I say (X)HTML 5 should just figure out <span style="font-weight: bold">everything</span> it wants to accomplish and do it. We can talk about how we want this and that to be changed, but if all we do it talk about it, how is that improving (X)HTML?<br /><br />Personally, I believe the best plan would to get everything figured out and set a date as to when UAs must conform to (X)HTML 5. Since Apple, Opera, and Mozilla are already backing this project, it just makes it that much easier. Prepare the UA vendors and publishers now, and set a date when (X)HTML 5 will be available. That way everyone (including the general public) will be prepared (whether or not they know it) for (X)HTML 5. Keeping backward-compatibility is slowing progress and keeping key features out of (X)HTML.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">bfrohs</a> — Thu May 17, 2007 7:18 am</p><hr />

The key is, as much as possible, to add new things in a way which doesn't breaking current things.<br /><br />Changing the way <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dt&gt;</span>+<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dd&gt;</span> elements get associated would probably break current things (such as the output from screen readers). Since the historic way associates them fine in practise and HTML5 makes this method bulletproof, breaking all the existing UA support for <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dl&gt;</span> seems like rather a high price to pay?<br /><br />Now, if <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> were introduced simply to make <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dt&gt;</span>+<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dd&gt;</span> associations more obvious to authors and had no influence on semantics, that would cause no breakage. However, the way the elements get associated is pretty easy to understand: when a <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dd&gt;</span> is followed by a <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dt&gt;</span>, a new group starts. So it doesn't make the markup a whole lot clearer, imho.<br /><br />If <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> were just to provide a convenient hook for styling, zcorpan's suggestion for something like a <span style="font-weight: bold">::key-value-pair</span> psuedo-element in CSS would provide that. Although <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> is already stylable in some browsers, styling is more logically done at the presentational level. And zcorpan's idea would add no filesize to the markup. <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><br /><br />There are a lot of &quot;housekeeping&quot; elements which <span style="font-style: italic">could</span> be introduced. However, unless they add significant practical advantages with minimal disadvantages, is it really worth adding them?

I'm not saying that I've thought all options and possible errors all the way through. I just experience an element missing whenever I work with <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dl&gt;</span>s.<br />But to answer tour questions... I think there are two options here:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>if <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span> will not be optional, these examples would not conform</li><li>if <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span> will be optional there are two options again:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>list items that are not explicitly grouped inside a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span> are grouped implicitly (so the first example would have one group, the second two)</li><li>if a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dl&gt;</span> contains no <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span>s at all, the 'old' way of grouping is used</li></ol></li></ol>Now that I think about it I guess I'd prefer option 1, making <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span> not an optional element. Option 2a could be defined as part of the 'error handling' then <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br />Option 2b would offer a backwards compatibilty opportunity, but therefore has the same 'incestuous' DOM structure (cousins sharing the same parent) as it has nowadays.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cerbera wrote:</cite><br />I think this DOM-based method would not be backwards compatible, particularly with assistive technologies.

I haven't been one to use <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span> within my forms in the past, but it does add a large amount structure to the form that is not present in the form itself. I believe adding <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;di&gt;</span> to <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dl&gt;</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dialog&gt;</span> would indeed add organization to the code as well as the document itself. You may be able to accomplish the same styling effects with CSS, but if all of (X)HTML was founded on this principle, <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;address&gt;, &lt;dialog&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt;</span> and other such elements would simply be replaced with <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;div&gt;</span>.<br /><br />As for backward compatibility, IE has done little to nothing other than slow down the progression of (X)HTML on the Web. Nearly every web designer complains about IE, yet due to the market share IE has, they give in and use CSS Hacks or don't use some features of (X)HTML at all simply because IE doesn't support it. In my opinion, the large market share IE has is due to the fact that web designers give in to IE and make their sites IE-compatible. Many of these users don't even know the bad practices of IE. For example, my parents had no idea. They are now avid Firefox users. We cannot jump forward as quickly as we like, but we must force IE into changing. If we don't, they will continue to serve up web pages any way they like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">bfrohs</a> — Wed May 16, 2007 8:17 pm</p><hr />

(I also think form validation and <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dialog&gt;</span> are unnecessary additions to HTML. But I assume there's a good reason for them, just that I don't know what it is.)<br /><br />I think anyone would agree that, on the surface, <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> is a good idea. But since the relationship is just as unambiguous without this element, it doesn't seem to add that much value. Also, we aren't talking about deprecating <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> and replacing it with an all-new association method, we are talking about whether <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> is worth adding.<br /><br />If you are proposing that <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> would replace the existing grouping mechanism so that it used DOM relationships rather than element types, consider this:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;dl&gt;<br /> &lt;di&gt;<br />  &lt;dt&gt;foo&lt;/dt&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;bar&lt;/dd&gt;<br />  &lt;dt&gt;bish&lt;/dt&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;bash&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;/di&gt;<br />&lt;/dl&gt;</code></dd></dl>Would this mean:<br /><ul><li>foo = bar</li><li>bish = bash</li></ul>Or:<br /><ul><li>foo, bish = bar, bash</li></ul>If it's the former, the historic association method is adequate. If it's the latter, what would happen when <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> is absent:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;dl&gt;<br /> &lt;dt&gt;foo&lt;/dt&gt;<br /> &lt;dd&gt;bar&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;dt&gt;bish&lt;/dt&gt;<br /> &lt;dd&gt;bash&lt;/dd&gt;<br />&lt;/dl&gt;</code></dd></dl>And what about when some but not all groups in a <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dl&gt;</span> are contained by a <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span>:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;dl&gt;<br /> &lt;di&gt;<br />  &lt;dt&gt;foo&lt;/dt&gt;<br />  &lt;dd&gt;bar&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;/di&gt;<br /> &lt;dt&gt;bish&lt;/dt&gt;<br /> &lt;dd&gt;bash&lt;/dd&gt;<br /> &lt;dt&gt;alpha&lt;/dt&gt;<br /> &lt;dd&gt;beta&lt;/dt&gt;<br />&lt;/dl&gt;</code></dd></dl>I think this DOM-based method would not be backwards compatible, particularly with assistive technologies. That would make HTML5's <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dl&gt;</span> less accessible than HTML4's -- a very undesirable outcome.<br /><br />It's all about the nuts and bolts!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27">Cerbera</a> — Wed May 16, 2007 8:05 pm</p><hr />

Of course CSS and JavaScript can be used to emphasise the grouping and act as if there really are different branches within de <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dl&gt;</span> tree.<br />Form validation can be done as well with JavaScript in HTML 4.

Shall we call those deprecated as well, since adding <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;legends&gt;</span> to a form already implies the start of a new group of form fields as well in the same manner as a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span> does within a <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dl&gt;</span>. Even more perhaps as only one <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;legend&gt;</span> is allowed per group which is not the case for <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;dt&gt;</span>s.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=87">Sander Aarts</a> — Tue May 15, 2007 4:44 pm</p><hr />

The association of <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dt&gt;</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dd&gt;</span> elements in a <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dl&gt;</span> has been part of HTML for a long time. HTML5 makes this association really explicit, so it's hardly a &quot;crippled&quot; element. A new element isn't necessary to improve the semantics of <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dl&gt;</span>.<br /><br />Allowing reversed order of terms and definitions might not be compatible with current UAs. I've read that modern screen readers can provide announcements which rely on the historic order, such as saying &quot;equals&quot; after each <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dt&gt;</span>. The benefits to allowing reversed order seem marginal...<span style="font-weight: bold">float: right;</span> or relative positioning or absolute position should enable any visual order using the historic source order?<br /><br />AFAIK, scripting could loop through the descendants of <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dl&gt;</span> to locate <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dt&gt;</span>+<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;dd&gt;</span> groups to apply whatever behaviour was desired?. The algorithm for this is spelled out in HTML5, from what I can tell.<br /><br />I can understand that <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> could make the markup more readable, sure. But prettifying the markup seems a rather extravagant reason to add a new element?<br /><br />On the surface, <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;di&gt;</span> does make sense. But when you dig into the nuts and bolts, it seems less and less useful to me. But as I mentioned, I'm no expert.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27">Cerbera</a> — Tue May 15, 2007 3:56 pm</p><hr />
