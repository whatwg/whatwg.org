In HTML you have the luxury of <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;/li&gt;</span> being an optional tag.

First off, replacing an existing feature because it is badly implemented with another feature based on the argument that the new feature won't have any bugs, <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1108984991&amp;count=1" class="postlink">doesn't make any sense</a>.<br /><br />What we should do here is try to fix contenteditable.<br /><br />Why there is so poor interoperability today is mostly because there hasn't been any spec. Having <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#contenteditable" class="postlink">a spec</a> hopefully fixes the interoperability problems.<br /><br />I don't know enough about contenteditable myself to know what the other problems are. I know Vlad has concerns that it is too presentationally oriented. Other than that, what specifically are the problems that needs to be addressed (and isn't already with the current spec in HTML5)? We probably need more input from WYSIWYG vendors here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Tue Mar 20, 2007 9:30 pm</p><hr />

This probably isn't the right place to ask, but I don't know where else to raise a cross-browser lack of standards issue?<br /><br />Vlad Alexander of Xstandard outlined the <a href="http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=50928#50928" class="postlink">issues with contentEditable</a>, and why they stopped using it. Due to backwards compatibility concerns this can't be changed, but could someone define a better, more standards friendly version? I.e. one that doesn't allow inline markup.<br /><br />At the moment it's so hard to create a standards aware WYSIWYG editor because there is so much cleanup you have to do. JavaScript based editors seem so flaky because of this (or at least partly because of this).<br /><br />Xstandard created a pluggin/ActiveX control to get over the issue, but surely this is something that should be standardised browser functionality?<br /><br />Then you wouldn't need to allow for font tags for CMSs (not that I think you should anyway). I've looked into the requirements for standards aware and <a href="http://alastairc.ac/2006/09/wysiwyg-editor-spec/" class="postlink">accessible WYSIWYG editors</a>, but it would be much easier if there were a better underlying mechanism.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16">alastc</a> — Tue Mar 20, 2007 6:44 pm</p><hr />
