Certain ISP's (from what I've read all are cable companies) filter internet contents and intentionally reduce the performance of their networks because they're after money, not providing great service.<br /><br />I can understand from YouTube/Google's perspective that it would not be desirable to simply cache a 500 megabyte video and then have the user go elsewhere wasting the bandwidth.<br /><br />However if videos stop loading for you outright there is certainly something wrong.<br /><br />There is also HTML5 and Flash to consider...are they HTML5 video elements or the Flash plugin?<br /><br />&quot;Whenever you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot; - Arthur Conan Doyle<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Fri Jun 10, 2011 3:19 pm</p><hr />

Now, I've been around on Youtube for almost 5 years now and I'm NOT in the mood for any automated replies, any people seeking some kind of approval rating for their &quot;helpful insight' or petty mod coverage by the oh-ever-so-wonderful Youtube Community staff.<br /><br />This is not supposed to be rant, so I'll try to keep it short.<br />Over the many years, Youtube's done a lot of stuff to make me aggrivated, but it all got sorted out pretty quick. Now this issue, yet unexplained and illogical is my following gripe.<br /><br />Whenever I'm watching certain videos, if not all videos, they start the initial quick-buffer load (where it automatically loads 25% of the bar), yet after that it loads extremely slowly and afterwards it stops loading completely.<br /><br />I've tried clearing my cookies, my browser cache, I've tried different browsers, cleaning my history, updating all my drivers, flash player, re-installing a ton of stuff and I've tried simply restarting my browser.<br /><br />I'm running a 60mb/s internet package plan, so it CERTAINLY doesn't pertain to my internet speed. I've been through the Youtube Help files and they say it may be a &quot;temporary site issue&quot;. I've looked through this forum and I've seen one other post detailing this particular problem, but it got completely ignored (which I do not intend to let happen with mine).<br /><br />Could anyone please tell me what the hell is going on? I'm just trying to enjoy some videos, but if they can't load for no apparent reason, I can't get enjoyment out of them, right?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br />   web3mantra<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1960">web3mantra</a> — Fri Jun 10, 2011 11:12 am</p><hr />
