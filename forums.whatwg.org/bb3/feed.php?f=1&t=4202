There's a possibility it will come back (likely with a major overhaul). I can't say when, though (or even if). It probably depends on how much demand there is for it.<br /><br />The alternative is to implement it with javascript.<br /><br />It would be helpful if you sent an email to whatwg detailing your use cases for datagrid; what problems you want to see solved. Also maybe point to your app where you work around the lack of this feature.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Fri Jan 08, 2010 9:34 am</p><hr />

Hi,<br /><br />I own a small software development company, and I am evaluating RIA technologies for use for the next version of our software.  Our roadmap is that the new version will be into production in about 1-2 years.<br /><br />I have been VERY impressed with HTML 5, especially philosophically as I don't like AJAX mashups, flash or silverlight as they don't seem native, or &quot;puristic&quot; so to speak (I may as well build a native app and deploy over the web e.g. Java Webstart or WPF).<br /><br />The thing is, our app heavily relies on editable tabular data.  It seems to me that the datagrid element would fill this role, however in August 09 it was removed - is there any chance it will be brought back?  If yes, what is the rough timeline?  If no, what is the suggested alternative?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Justin<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=876">JStafford</a> — Thu Jan 07, 2010 11:04 pm</p><hr />
