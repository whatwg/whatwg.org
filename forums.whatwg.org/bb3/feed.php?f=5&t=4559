Basically you are right, it's people sharing ideas that make up a community. Newer, cleaner software is merely a vehicle.<br /><br />But I think the main point here is that using old standards to promote new standards is very paradoxical.<br /><br />I shall be working on moving these forums over to PHPBB3.0 which has been confirmed to be using a lot better semantic markup and much less use of tabular layout. There is also an effort in place to modernize the markup for PHPBB 3.2 which I will be looking more in to.<br /><br />I also like your ideas presented for contests. Certainly a good way to get people interested in using new html standards and as a result discussing potential improvements to the spec.<br /><br />I created a new forums for sharing ideas: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://forums.whatwg.org/viewforum.php?f=5">http://forums.whatwg.org/viewforum.php?f=5</a><!-- m --><br />That section is where the contests should be held<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I am going to go ahead and lock this topic.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">ps</span>: Feel free to start your own contest if you like.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Sat Mar 12, 2011 3:34 pm</p><hr />

What about a facility to comment and provide feedback about sites we all publish? (perhaps and extra level of protection for this)<br /><br />I know these seem like suggestions, but they are not... I am simply throwing ideas out there first. I dunno your thoughts on competitions in general but what about a simple CSS type thing like the zen garden?! - just to get started? - blog about it it, post about it, throw up a few well-seo'ed' pages and attract entries and potentially active members<br /><br />From what I see there are only a handful of contributors, a few new folks trickle in and then trickle out, only coz of lack of activity.

I think there needs to be more interest. I shall create a section on these forums later for the specific sharing of website ideas. <br /><br />Anyone who has ideas in terms of improving the community forums can then submit a suggestion, and discuss it. I feel the community at this point is simply to small to have a diverse &quot;contest&quot; of sorts. <br /><br />I am also going to be watching the development of PHPBB4 as I believe they are planning on taking the software to the next generation (using Symfony2 framework and Doctrine). It is in very early stages at this point though, so we will most likely be wanting to upgrade to PHPBB3 here shortly.<br /><br />also, agreed:<br /><blockquote><div><cite>benschwarz wrote:</cite><br />...a project of this really needs to be lead by a dictator...<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I shall be that dictator <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br />j/k<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Fri Mar 11, 2011 9:50 pm</p><hr />

Sounds great. I will be sure to send an e-mail. <br /><br />Basically. As I mentioned. I am not the most experienced, but very full of ideas. I am heading to college this fall to begin my bachelors in Computer Science (at the ripe age of 25). I have been spending most evenings studying web development based topics and this could be a great project to further advance my knowledge. <br /><br />I have been playing around with a lot of CSS3 and HTML5 lately and the thought of what could be accomplished in terms of customizing a bulletin board system is pretty intense. Features such as web fonts and transitions could really be a nice touch, and the best part is they degrade gracefully by nature. <br /><br />Unfortunately my level of JavaScript is horrible at the moment, which is a major hold back. <br /><br />I have my own development hosting that I could set up an installation of PHPBB4 on and check it out. <br /><br />The fun challenge would be completely changing the look of these forums, so visitors don't even know they are phpbb. Creating a new forum system from scratch is a whole new ball game, and I would say more people with more time would be required to make it work. I am going to be learning Symfony2 PHP framework here soon though, so maybe down the line that custom idea could be explored. <br /><br />A couple of other ideas:<br /><br />- Press <span style="font-weight: bold">/</span> to focus the quick reply txt box, and <span style="font-weight: bold">enter</span> to submit message (kinda like the search box on developers.whatwg.org. This could allow for rapid sharing of ideas on the forums.<br /><br />-Integration of the mailing list, with the Forums. This to me is a no brainier. The forums have their advantages (more accessible to some), as does the mailing list. But instead of fragmenting the ideas on two separate mediums, combine them. Even if it is just a simple feed that is imported to a specified section of the forums. <br /><br />Also, promoting the forums (and whatwg for that matter) is key. The flow of ideas that these forums could hold with enough community members could potentially be incredible. And with more active contributers, comes the ability for extensive clever enhancements to the website/forums/etc.<br /><br />sry abt the long post. <br />Xdega.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Thu Mar 10, 2011 5:33 pm</p><hr />

I don't think changing forum software would be neccsary. The beauty of phpbb is that it is open source. It would definitely be a good idea to make sure the site is updated to the <span style="font-weight: bold">latest version</span> of phpbb, however. I think a contest would be a fantastic idea, on the basis of making a completely custom looking &quot;style&quot; for the forums that is fully compliant with the current html and .css spec. (making sure depreciated tags are not used in the source code etc). The great thing about phpbb is that anyone can download the source code and mess with it as they please. Hosting contest entries may be a slight barrier, but nothing that a collective community if web devs couldn't figure out. I am actually excited about a potential WHATWG forum contest. Although I may not be the best, the idea of playing around with new html standards for somthing practical sounds very fun.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2011 3:25 pm</p><hr />

Hi.<br />My name is Liam.  <br />Just signed up, pleased to hopefully share my ideas in the WHATWG effort. One thing I would really like to state right off the bat though. These default phpbb forums are really un-flattering and don't offer much in the way of aesthetic pleasure. <br /><br />Just a question, are there any plans to make they look a little nicer? I would be more than happy to assist in any way I can. Albeit I am no expert. A mere Comp Sci major (starting this fall), But I do have an interest in graphic arts to a certain degree.  <br /><br />Something inspiring though is documents like: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://developers.whatwg.org/">http://developers.whatwg.org/</a><!-- m --><br />They way it shows really nice layout, and rich features. It's clean and most importantly it feels <span style="font-weight: bold">custom and un-canned</span>. If you catch my drift <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Seems miles apart in terms of layout etc. Maybe show off some of the rich new HTML features?<br /><br />Anyways, glad to be here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Tue Mar 01, 2011 6:39 pm</p><hr />
