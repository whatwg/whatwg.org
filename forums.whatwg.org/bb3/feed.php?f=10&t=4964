1. What is obsolete? Linking to an element with an id=&quot;&quot; is certainly allowed. If the user wants to &quot;scroll back&quot;, just use the browser's back button.<br /><br />2. I suggest you read some tutorials on appcache.

Hi, everyone!<br /><br />I hope, that someone will be able to help me out. The problem is that I'm not actually an expert but I'm trying to build a HTML5 based website and I have incountered 2 problems:<br /><ul><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Page jump.</span> Formelly, I was using <dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;a href=&quot;www.example.com#bring_me_here&quot; /&gt;</code></dd></dl>, so in a page with a long content, which forces user to scroll down the page to read it all, he still could be able to go up, to the begining of the page. Very easy, nothing special. But now it became be obsolete &amp; anyway I want it to be different. I want to write with your help a code (html &amp; css), that will make appear on the left words like &quot;Go up&quot; but only if the page is long like <a href="http://holdem.ucoz.com/lang/it/ency/gen/regole-generali.html" class="postlink">http://holdem.ucoz.com/lang/it/ency/gen/regole-generali.html</a> and if it has been scrolled down, but dissapear if the page is short and doesn't require any button to go up &amp; anyway that would be following the users navigation. I'm sure, there is a way, probabily well known, but I repeat, I'm not an expert.</ul><ul><span style="font-weight: bold">2. HTML manifest.</span> About the cache. I have found the article about it, I wrote a manifest.cache to cache the files for offline browsing, I have added the reference to this file as you can see in the page posted before. The question is: does it works corectly? How can I check, if I wrote it corectly and if the server does actually support it? I cleared the cache of my browser, visited the site by viewing few pages, turned off the internet connection &amp; tried to navigate site. It was possible, but only sometimes &amp; only for few clicks, and then, when the site became inaccessible, the offline.html did not appeared. Maybe, I'm doing something wrong? The file is hosted here <a href="http://holdem.ucoz.com/lang/it/manifest.cache" class="postlink">http://holdem.ucoz.com/lang/it/manifest.cache</a>.</ul><br />I would really appriciate any help!<br />Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3429">LovDesArt</a> — Sat Jan 14, 2012 2:19 pm</p><hr />
