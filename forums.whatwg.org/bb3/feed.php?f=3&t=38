The parsing section was written by reverse engineering what browsers do. The goal here is to achieve interoperability. Unless I'm mistaken, parsing &lt;noscript&gt; as CDATA when scripting is disabled, and as PCDATA when scripting is enabled, is something that all browsers already do. If we already have interop on something, it seems unwise to specify something different.<br /><br />Parsing XHTML5 is nothing more than parsing XML with namespaces. We already have interop here as well: &lt;noscript&gt; is always parsed as PCDATA by all XML processors, without exception. It seems unwise to require XHTML-aware UAs to modify the DOM after parsing or ignore some parse events, since that would mean that the parsed tree would be different depending on whether the UA is XHTML-aware or not.<br /><br />To put it in another way, what is specified as to what UAs have to do is largely what they are already doing.<br /><br />With this situation, it is still possible to allow authors to use &lt;noscript&gt; in XHTML5, it's just that it will contain elements if you put elements inside... (UAs could still apply display:none when scripting is disabled.)<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Jarvklo wrote:</cite><br />My point is - as you also mentioned actually zcorpan, I just didn't pick it up at the time - that &lt;noscript&gt; is not the only element with &quot;extra semantics&quot; that cannnot be expressed in generic XML and therefore needs &quot;an extra step&quot; to be handled from an XML perspective, but it non the less actually works, today and in practice, in XHTML sent as &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;<br /></div></blockquote>I'm not sure I understand what you mean here.

Hate to be a pain..., but I feel I have to pitch in another two cents here to extend my argument for a &quot;regardless of serializations&quot; handling of  noscript.<br /><br />To me it seems like it's actually the HTML5 spec that introduces changes to the &lt;noscript&gt; element that turns it into something that cannot be handled from XHTML5.<br />Now - I'm sure there are good reasons for this, but I'm still not sure that I see them yet. And I'm definately not convinced that the reasons for introducing such a barrier between HTML5 and XHTML5 (that also affects at least some interpretations of &quot;good practices&quot; based on what WCAG1 says about using noscript) are strong enough. <br />Please bare with me!<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>zcorpan wrote:</cite><br />In HTML it is parsed differently depending on whether scripting is enabled or not. That cannot be done with an XML parser.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />In XHTML1.0, the content type of nosctipt is either %Block; or %Flow; depending on if you are using &quot;Strict&quot; or &quot;Transitional&quot;. <br />In XHTML 1.1 it's &quot;(Heading | List | Block)+&quot;<br /><br />Either way, this suggests that any &quot;generic XML parser&quot; must treat the content of &lt;noscript&gt; as simply &quot;some markup that follows some rules&quot;, and that there has to be some type of &quot;additional semantic handling step&quot; in the parsing/&quot;compiling&quot; process that prunes the resulting - generic - XML DOM if you want the result to behave like XHTML (i.e. noscript node excluded if scripting disabled or not present) and not just &quot;semantics outside of the DTD/Schema neutral&quot; XML.<br /><br />Now what I don't understand is why a model is chosen for HTML5 that excludes noscript from XHTML5 *by design*.<br /><br />You mention that XML parser cannot change parsing based on - basically - an exernal setting (eg. &quot;Scripting enabled&quot;) <br />If you are familiar with SAX this could be accomplished for XHTML 1.x whithout much inconvenience actually (i.e. set up event handlers that simply &quot;ignore the content and balance the depth of noscript elements&quot; as they go along). If you load everything into a generic DOM tree, XSLT could be used to prune either the &lt;script&gt; or &lt;noscript&gt; parts of a tree before it's passed on to &quot;execution of semantics&quot; (i.e. issue http-requests for imaages, execute script blocks etc. etc. etc.).<br /><br />Now, I don't mention this to imply anything than &quot;Hate to bother you, but if I'm not entirely mistaken it *can* actually be done under some circumstances&quot;. <br /><br />My point is - as you also mentioned actually zcorpan, I just didn't pick it up at the time - that &lt;noscript&gt; is not the only element with &quot;extra semantics&quot; that cannnot be expressed in generic XML and therefore needs &quot;an extra step&quot; to be handled from an XML perspective, but it non the less actually works, today and in practice, in XHTML sent as &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;<br /><br />And - Again - Please make noscript either work in both HTML5 and XHTML or chuck it out of both.<br /><br />Thanks for listening (again)  <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15">Jarvklo</a> — Tue May 01, 2007 6:57 pm</p><hr />

The difference is that in HTML5 you can use document.write(), plus that &lt;noscript&gt; is parsed differently whether scripting is enabled or not. Using document.write()+&lt;noscript&gt; is simpler and possibly safer than document.write()+DOM methods to remove &quot;noscript&quot; content, or DOM methods for both insertion and removal. In XML, using DOM methods is the only option for insertion (well and .innerHTML), and &lt;noscript&gt; content will still contain real elements, running the risk of e.g. submitting form controls that only were intended to be submitten when scripting was disabled.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Mon Apr 30, 2007 8:41 am</p><hr />

That's what I wish for! <br />IMHO having as few differences between HTML5 and XHTML5 as technically possible is a good way to &quot;sell&quot; (X)HTML5 to people like me (i.e. old stubborn farts with a WCAG/XHTML intense background) at least. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>zcorpan wrote:</cite><br />As for a reference, search for &quot;noscript&quot; in the parsing section.

When scripting is disabled, noscript is parsed as PCDATA, and there will be a text field in the DOM. XML cannot switch parse modes like HTML, so it will always be PCDATA in XHTML.<br /><br />So, &quot;doesn't work&quot; might be a bit of a stretch, especially since the same applies to e.g. &lt;iframe&gt;. Perhaps it shouldn't be disallowed in XHTML5?<br /><br />As for a reference, search for &quot;noscript&quot; in the parsing section.
