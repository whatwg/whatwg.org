As I've already mentioned in another thread: <br />The original, initial idea of the WhatWG, of WebForms and HTML5 was, to make more things possible without Scripting. One reason was to make many basic functions available even when Scripting is off.<br /><br />Of course, not everything would make sense to do without scripting, because this would get too complicated. But these things mentioned here are good examples of basic functions, that should be possible without scripting. Especially the search-suggestions as-you-type would be fantastic to use without scripting. And the superior checkboxes that control inferior checkboxes would be great too and even easier to implement.<br /><br />I don't know, which technical changes have to be done to do this, but they sure should be done.<br /><br />And I have one idea, that would be a big improvement without changing HTML, it should be done in the browsers:<br />many webpages (e.g. Wikipedia, Google, Bing, and many many more) only have one text-input field. The others are checkboxes, radio-buttons,... At such pages user-input is always meant for this single field, because there are no others that are awaiting text. All browsers should place text-input on pages with only one text-input field into this field - even when the cursor isn't activated in it. That would be a big improvement of usability!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3428">Pascal</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2012 9:56 am</p><hr />

I totally agree that search-suggestions should be possible without scripting. (I use Firefox with the NoScript-extension too.)<br /><br />But we should not forget, that this thread also has even more suggestions for forms that are great too.<br /><br />Of course not everything makes sense to do without scripting, but some useful und widely used basic features that can be done without scripting (e.g. search-suggestions) should be possible without scripting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1938">Niklas81</a> — Mon Aug 15, 2011 8:11 am</p><hr />

NoScript is a good idea though not executed in the most graceful of manners, your point about clients disabling scripting is valid.<br /><br />I think HTML5 won't be very universal until about the mid-2020s as Microsoft supports each version of Internet Explorer for far beyond a sane amount of time and IE9 doesn't support HTML5 forms. I would like to see the continued trend of automating certain things; if auto-suggest can be automated then that would be great. <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2011 8:45 am</p><hr />

Maybe my english isn't good enough, but I agree with you: somebody who makes big websites with search-functions should know about scripting. And those people, who only want to have a personal website don't use search-functions or use the ready-to-use google-search.<br /><br />So, forget what I've said about webdesigners.<br /><br />But:<br />there are still the users. And some users deactivate Scripting (for security or whatever other reason) and on other computers (school, university, work,...) you are not able to change the settings, even if you want to. E.g. I use NoScript and only allow scripting on very few trusted sites, that really need it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1885">Tobias Hanser</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2011 7:45 am</p><hr />

That's all well and fine Tobias though you've missed my point; if you don't know any JavaScript then you're <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> a web designer. If you decide to pursue jobs doing web design you won't be hired by anyone who knows better if you don't know at least a modest amount of scripting. As standards continue to evolve the uses of JavaScript will shift though it will still be a necessary part of what it takes to build sites that are more complex than a few static pages.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2011 7:30 am</p><hr />

Ah, sorry, I probably didn't read the whole thread (or I've probably read everything but forgot the first few pages of the thread and just read the last few posts asking for &lt;input type=search&gt; without saying what they wanted it to do).<br /><br />Anyway, I believe this is a noted feature request that might be added after browsers have implemented the current form feature set.

But that's not, what this thread is about. Beneath the other suggestions of this thread, the suggestion for search-fields doesn't mean only the optics of a search-field, but to have an option (an additional parameter or something like that), so that the webdesigner can use search-suggestions (like is known from Google, Wikipedia, and many other sites) without scripting!!<br /><br />That would not only be nice for webdesigners, that are not familiar with scripting (and the goal of HTML was, that many people can share information, not only programmers). But it would also be nice for users that have deactivated scripting (e.g. for security) or even can't change the settings (school, university, work, and so on). Search-suggestions are such a handy and basic function of websites, this should be possible without scripting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1885">Tobias Hanser</a> — Thu Aug 11, 2011 8:28 am</p><hr />

It's equivalent to &lt;input type=text&gt; except it renders as a search field. So it autocompletes just like type=text and suggestions need to be implemented with script (maybe using &lt;datalist&gt;).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Mon Aug 08, 2011 6:41 am</p><hr />
