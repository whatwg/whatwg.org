Media descriptors in (X)HTML are currently defined as a <span style="font-weight: bold">comma-separated</span> list. However, this is inconsistent with other list attributes in (X)HTML, such as @class, @rel (such as in links) and others. @media is defined as comma-separated in order to stay consistent with CSS, which was the origin of the attribute. However, this renders it strange to (X)HTML developers. This should be fixed by making @media <span style="font-weight: bold">space-separated</span>. Note that constructs such as &quot;print and resolution &gt; 90dpi&quot; can easily be converted to &quot;print[resolution&gt;90dpi]&quot;, which has the same effect but is consistent with other (X)HTML attributes.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is the problem you are trying to solve?</span><br />I am trying to make (X)HTML more consistent and thus easier to write for developers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is the feature you are suggesting to help solve it?</span><br />A small change to the @media attribute (such as of &lt;link&gt;s and &lt;style&gt;s) that would make it space, not comma, separated.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is the processing model for that feature, including error handling?</span><br />This would function in the same way as other attributes. Its a small change and should not mean any significant change to the processing model.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why do you think browsers would implement this feature?</span><br />Many browsers already recognize space-separated lists for the @media attribute.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why do you think authors would use this feature?</span><br />This section doesn't really apply to my proposal.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What evidence is there that this feature is desparately needed?</span><br />I myself have often made mistakes based on this inconistency. It is easy to imagine that while this doesn't necessarily cause mistakes often, its a pain to remember and an annoying inconsistency.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=265">pavpanchekha</a> — Wed Mar 12, 2008 6:38 pm</p><hr />
