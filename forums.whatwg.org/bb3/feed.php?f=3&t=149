I think that the xhtml event attributes will be deprecated when there will be a consistent implementation of XBL 2 and CSS Behavioural Extensions, allowing to separate action from semantic and without <br /><br />document.getElementById('something').onclick = etc.<br />or worse<br />document.getElementById('something').addEventHandler('click',etc.)<br /><br />using xbl, any xml element can act as a &quot;trigger&quot; element (provided it has a binding attached in any way)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=418">campax</a> — Tue Nov 25, 2008 5:18 pm</p><hr />

I use it on my site to be direct with visitors: I'm going to AJAX some content with an AJAX function so you're not going to a new page. You determine that by looking at the browser's status bar. I personally prefer seeing this versus seeing &quot;#&quot; in the status bar. Then I have no clue what it's going to do.<br /><br />You want annoying: popups for any reason what-so-ever. How long has CSS2 been around? It's called layers people, get with the program.<br /><br />Why do you have JavaScript disabled? Try talking for an entire day without using verbs and see how you are able to communicate with others around you.<br /><br />Also JavaScript (X)HTML attribute events are important for backwards compatibility. Unobtrusive is ok though not necessarily business friendly where I use modular JavaScript calling only functions from XHTML JavaScript attribute events.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Thu Oct 09, 2008 5:37 am</p><hr />

I would LOVE to see the end of<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;a href=&quot;javascript: goToPage&#40;5&#41;;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />Do I need to post examples of sites that do this?<br />Unfortunately I have this upsetting suspicion that this kind of bad practice can not be removed from the specification <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> as it is employed by one or two sites that I visit at least one day a week.<br /><br />It is hugely disruptive to my experience as a browser. On a website that allows user-submitted javascript in places I have to turn on javascript to navigate a product catalog, which I find frankly disgusting. You know what the goToPage() function does? It just navigates to a new page. There is no need for a javascript function to change the url.<br />Nor do we need javascript to open links in parent or child windows, but people do this too.<br /><br />In the case of the userland navigation function, it's even more disruptive when I try to open links into a new tab. I use the middle mouse button mroe than the others, and I hat that these bad web designers are taking away basic functionality in the browser.<br /><br />However as zcorpan pointed out, I guess that really if the browser is allowing my navigation to be broken this way then it is a bug in the browser, not in the specification.<br /><br />The user agent SHOULD be able to navigate to a new page in response to some user-initiated action in javascript, despite the high level of abuse.<br /><br />IS there any way that the standards process can shape this? I think it's too much to ask.<br />Surely we couldn't make <span style="font-weight: bold">javascript&#058;</span> urls invalid somehow.<br /><br />Sounds like a bug to put to browser vendors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=402">SneakyWho_am_i</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 1:02 pm</p><hr />

There's no need for event handlers within the markup when you can access everything using the DOM from a linked js document and this has been adopted by a lot of designers as good practice.<br /><br />Google &quot;unobtrusive javascript.&quot;<br /><br />If it were my spec, the only place for client-side scripting would be in an externally linked doc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=261">Erik Reppen</a> — Sat Mar 01, 2008 12:22 am</p><hr />

Do I understand correctly that the problem is as follows?:<br /><br />1) Authors use links to perform scripts<br />2) Such links can't be opened in a new tab<br /><br />And that a Firefox addon makes such links openable in a new tab? Or what does the addon do? If the addon solves the problem, wouldn't browsers doing the same thing by default also solve the problem?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Fri Feb 08, 2008 10:56 am</p><hr />

Hello,<br />I always get angry when I see codes like this:<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />&lt;a onclick=&quot;openImage('aaa.jpg');&quot;&gt;see image&lt;/a&gt;</span><br /><br />I mean, it's confusing, because such markup makes you think it's real link, and I often try to click it with middle mouse button, and get empty page (I know there's Firefox addon for it, recently found it, but it's better to solve problem).<br /><br />There might be few methods to get rid of this ambiguity. For example, a new new element, let's say it <span style="color: blue">&lt;trigger /&gt;</span> which destination would be use for launching scripts; and to say to user that it would be no href, but a script launched, it will have by default other cursor (e.g. pointer in different color or something).<br /><br />I know &lt;span /&gt; might be used, but no one does it. Maybe new element will encourage writers not to present scripts like hrefs...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;trigger onclick=&quot;doSomething();&quot;&gt;text&lt;/trigger&gt;</span><br /><br />It'll be to discuss how to replace a combination<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot; onclick=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span><br />I think &lt;a&gt;&lt;trigger&gt;&lt;/trigger&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;trigger onclick=&quot;..&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/trigger&gt; with well-defined how to handle such situations won't be bad. <br /><br /><br />It's only my general thought - it can evolve in different way, but I have no better idea right now. What do you think about it?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=247">jim</a> — Thu Feb 07, 2008 7:48 pm</p><hr />
