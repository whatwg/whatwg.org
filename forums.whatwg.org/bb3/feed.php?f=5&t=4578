That is the plan, eventually. This is just the start.<br />I have been in touch with the development team at PHPBB and they are planning on following WHATWG standards in their upcoming releases. <br /><br />There is an effort in place to have the markup following these modern and &quot;more semantic&quot; standards by version 3.2 (we currently have version 3.1 prior to that). <br />Understandably, there is going to be a delay on implementing these standards but at least they are incoming. <br /><br />Key thing here is that we have at least upgraded from software that was officially obsoleted several years ago, and thus using very out of date markup. <br />Much less tabular layouts and generally better set of features for managing a community are already in place with our current software.<br /><br />Custom styles etc are something we can work on next also.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Sun Mar 13, 2011 1:53 am</p><hr />

As much as I advocate XHTML I think the forum software should use HTML5. Just my humble opinion is all.  <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Sat Mar 12, 2011 10:29 pm</p><hr />
