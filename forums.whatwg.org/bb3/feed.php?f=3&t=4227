<blockquote><div><cite>zcorpan wrote:</cite><br />The native controls aren't stylable at all, at least currently.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Then this should be something to work on... <br /><br />It would be a good idea to have (neutral-looking) standard-controls for play/pause, stop, FF, Rew, full-screen, subtitles on/off, progress-bar and current-time/total-time. The author could decide which of them to show and in which order. And on a touch-device they're automatically scaled a bit bigger (by CSS-media-types). (Therefore they should be resolution-independent, e.g. in SVG.) <br /><br />And if somebody wants total different-looking controls, this author could modify the SVG (e.g. different colors) or make completely new SVGs.<br /><br />In this way, it works completely without scripting, but gives you full control and it's still very variable and modifiable: if somebody wants other designs, it's possible to modify the SVG-controls or make completely new.<br /><br />I think, this would be the best way to do it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1885">Tobias Hanser</a> — Mon Apr 18, 2011 9:30 am</p><hr />

I agree, that it should be possible, to have the controls (play/pause, back, forward, volume,...) without Scripting. <br /><br />Because many users have Scripting deactivated or use add-ins like &quot;NoScript&quot;. They do so because of security or other reasons. Or you are on a machine (school, university, work,...) where you are not allowed or even not able to change the settings.<br /><br />And these users should also be possible to see and control the video and audio.<br /><br />If that is not a part of HTML it should be in CSS. But it really should be done without Scripting (for the reasons mentioned above).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1062">MarcelStetter</a> — Sat Mar 27, 2010 11:24 am</p><hr />

We can't have standardized controls, because HTML is media independent. For instance, the iPhone doesn't have any keys at all, so your proposed UI makes no sense on the iPhone.<br /><br />In general, HTML doesn't say anything about UI. If it did, it would probably suck and become out of date quickly. UI is an area for user agents to compete. No need for interop in UI.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Fri Mar 12, 2010 7:52 am</p><hr />
