You may for instance want to use that setting to reencode the sound on the server, correctly balanced.<br /><br />Then a very precise case I am indeed confronted with and for which I haven't yet found any solution : one of my client has media with two sound tracks associated with a video. One is the normal sound track and the second is the speaking clock used to index the video. The issue is that thoses two tracks are randomly organised on the left or right side of a stereoscopic media. At playing time, the user should be able to shut down the speaking clock track by setting the sound balance accordingly.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=308">pvk</a> — Mon Jan 05, 2009 10:21 am</p><hr />
