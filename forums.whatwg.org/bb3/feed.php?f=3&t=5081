Do not forget that even if it's not in the HTML5 spec it's in older specs and you're not required to use newer specs. In example by using XHTML 1.1 I can extend XHTML 1.1 to use (X)HTML5 just fine while not dealing with the many issues such as the noscript element being incorrectly moved to the head instead of in the body where it belongs. Standards don't always get things right any way, for example collapsed margins is anti-intuitive and forces the use of padding to emulate margins correctly and no one has made any valid argument for it. So use both abbr and acronym elements, browsers will still (usually) render them the way they're supposed to be used.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Tue Oct 16, 2012 3:15 am</p><hr />

I could go with this but ...<br /><br />It is not the spec. for HTML5. It is one man's view of trying to make &lt;abbr&gt; work. Other people/devices will interpret-ate &lt;abbr&gt; differently and have their own views of how to best implement the element.<br /><br />Here is a statement from the reference:<br /><br />'Because HTML5 removed &lt;acronym&gt; this is the only instance you should use abbr without a title to indicate to users and screen readers that the initialism should be pronounced rather than spelt out.'.<br /><br />What if the &lt;acronym&gt; needs a title? This special rule, an &lt;abbr&gt; without a title (assuming everyone learns it), has lost its meaning and will not be said as a word.<br /><br />I buy it that many abbreviations do not need to be marked up because they are obvious and people can find out what the meaning is elsewhere. I also can see great value in using the title to fit in with the flow of the spoken content but ...<br /><br />Everyone would learn very quickly that an &lt;acronym&gt; is used when we want the abbreviation to be spoken as a word.<br /><br />This would even fit in with the advice given in Kroc's article and he could drop the special meaning &lt;abbr&gt; without a title example.<br /><br />Now Kroc would just use &lt;acronym&gt; by itself to fit in with his example. Every person/device would know to speak the word. Kroc would be happy and all his other advise would stand. Others could now use the title attribute with &lt;acronym&gt; if they so desire. The word would still be spoken and not spelt out letter by letter. We now have the correct semantic element to do the right thing. Everybody is happy. Especially me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3652">Willabee</a> — Mon Oct 15, 2012 7:42 pm</p><hr />

I hope it works Willabee.<br /><br />If some people don't understand the differences then either the examples don't clearly stress their differences or you're showing it to people who aren't qualified to make such decisions.<br /><br />Mailing lists work funny and so when you post you may want to request direct email replies if you don't intend to filter out all of the incoming related email. It's an antiquated system but apparently some people like it. I think forums work better though. <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Mon Oct 15, 2012 4:39 pm</p><hr />

If not, they should. It would make absolute sense if they did.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Why? What are trying to solve? Why should the definition of &quot;The Regiment&quot; be in a title attribute rather than as text inline?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Just trying to give an example. The important thing is the three elements have different semantics.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />That's fine, but you could also use classes for this purpose which allows you to go further than the categorization of stuff that HTML has (e.g. what if you want to style all subjectives etc in a sentence when teaching a language?).<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Adding classes is a disease called 'Classititus'. It adds weight to the page. Important in the mobile world.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />If you want links to Wikipedia, why not put them in directly? Surely that's less work and more reliable than using an indirection as you propose?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Adding direct links once again increases the weight of the page. It's an effort to code in the markup. One line of jQuery automates the process of linking all my abbr, acronym and dfn to Wikipedia. Great use of progressive enhancement when JavaScript is available.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Just use &lt;abbr&gt; instead. If you need to style it differently or target it from scripts, use class=&quot;&quot; to indicate what kind of abbreviation (there are more kinds than just &quot;acronym&quot; and &quot;not acronym&quot;).<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />No thank you. For reasons expressed elsewhere in this reply.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Which have you heard?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />People like you, who have failed to convince me otherwise. As is still the case.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />For the record, IIRC, it was dropped because people don't know which of acronym and abbr to use ...<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />It is not an excuse to drop a semantic element because people do not understand the difference between spelling out an abbreviation and saying an acronym. Surely this is not rocket science? Even my seven year old granddaughter understands the difference.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3652">Willabee</a> — Thu Oct 11, 2012 8:30 am</p><hr />

Unable to find if this topic has been previously covered, I think it is plain wrong that the acronym element has been deprecated in HTML5 and should be part of its semantics.<br /><br />A screen reader can emphasise (em) and stress the importance (strong) of words, just to mention a couple of elements that are used for better semantics. A designer can target these semantic elements and stylistically present them to offer better visual semantics.<br /><br />Surely, a screen reader should do the right thing when it meets phrases such as, The <span style="font-weight: bold">SAS</span> soldier visited the <span style="font-weight: bold">NAAFI </span>to meet his fellow troopers from <span style="font-weight: bold">'The Regiment'</span>.<br /><br />Here we have an abbreviation, an acronym and a definition. Each should be marked up differently and titled, <span style="font-style: italic">'Special Air Service'</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">'Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes</span>' and <span style="font-style: italic">'The name used, affectionately, by members of the Armed Forces to refer to members of the SAS regiment'</span> respectfully.<br /><br />A screen reader would spell out the letters <span style="font-weight: bold">'S' 'A' 'S'</span>, say the word <span style="font-weight: bold">Naafi</span> and possibly make use of the titles, especially for the definition; <span style="font-weight: bold">'The Regiment'</span>.<br /><br />A designer could also stylistically present each of these semantics to visually identify them, if desired.<br /><br />To complete our progressive enhancements, a JavaScript programmer would be able to parse the markup and change each of these into a link to Wikipedia for a free glossary of terms.<br /><br />Obviously, you would need to make sure you got these the right way around, because you would not want to call an SAS man a <span style="font-weight: bold">'sassy'</span>! <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />This is just as, in fact more, important than some of the elements that are part of HTML5 currently; (i) and (b) for example.<br /><br />It is hurting me and many others I have discussed this topic with, that we have lost the acronym element.<br /><br />I have heard all the arguments for and against but none have convinced me that <span style="font-weight: bold">ACRONYM </span> should not be one of the important elements of the HTML5 semantics.<br /><br />Please do the right thing and rectify this error of judgement.<br /><br />Thank you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3652">Willabee</a> — Tue Oct 09, 2012 1:27 pm</p><hr />
