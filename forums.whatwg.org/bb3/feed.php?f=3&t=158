<title type="html"><![CDATA[Are percent integers still valid in &lt;AREA&gt; coordinates]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/viewtopic.php?t=158&amp;p=4769#p4769"><![CDATA[
1) When I last looked the HTML4 standard never clarified whether percent<br />     units in an integer list for the COORDS= values in an &lt;AREA&gt; where<br />     relative to the size of the pixmap file, or relative to the displayed size<br />     (ie. relative to the WIDTH= and HEIGHT= values of the &lt;IMG&gt; using the &lt;MAP&gt;). <br /><br />      I had really hoped the percent units where relative to the displayed size, which would make it so one set of COORDS= could be used for different sizes of the same image; making imagemap maintenance much<br />easier when using resized images. <br /><br />      Empirically, I found this not to be the case' at least with opera, firefox,<br />      chrome, iexplorer, .... and whatever else I tried at the time.<br /><br />2) Remembering this, I looked at the HTML5 spec. to see how it described the use of percent units for coordinates. <br />     A) I found it said coordinates could only be a list of integers as described in 2.4.3.6. Does this mean percent coordinates are not allowed<br />in HTMl5?<br />     B) As I read 2.4.3.6 it states in the first paragraph that the only allowed<br />         delimiter is a comma; and specifically states spaces are not allowed.<br /><br />         But in rule 6 of 2.4.3.6 it seems to imply a space, comma, or semi-colon is an allowed delimiter in a &quot;List of Integers&quot;. <br /><br />So .. did I miss something or are percent-units no longer allowed as coordinates? What are the delimiters allowed in a list of integers? And, I<br />wish percent units scaled to the displayed image size ( as I mentioned in<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/semaphore.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/semaphore.html</a><!-- m --> ). If percent units are permitted, I think it would be worth mentioning what they are a percent<br />of (image file units or displayed image size units).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=240">urbanjost</a> — Tue Jan 06, 2009 4:07 am</p><hr />

That last line that says 1) Reference:... is an accidental artifact of how I<br />made the message. I created the message as HTML and then converted <br />it to text with &quot;lynx -dump FILENAME&quot;; and missed one of the lines<br />that I wanted to delete from the resulting text field. If it can be deleted it<br />should be; else ignore it.<br /><br />The example I referred to is up above in the body of the text.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=240">urbanjost</a> — Tue Feb 26, 2008 2:07 am</p><hr />

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Client-side image maps should be scalable]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/viewtopic.php?t=158&amp;p=633#p633"><![CDATA[
An enhancement I would like in HTML5 is that the coordinates in a<br />   client-side image map (see &lt;IMG&gt; , &lt;MAP&gt; , &lt;AREA&gt; in the HTML<br />   documentation) would scale with the image; to be backward-compatible<br />   there would have to be a flag to say the coordinates are relative to<br />   the pixmap and not the displayed size. To demonstrate the problem<br />   I made<br />   <br />      <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/semaphore.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/semaphore.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />   This example shows that if the IMG image is resized to 300x300 (click<br />   the button) that the associated coordinates for the AREA areas are<br />   not. At 1000x1000 you can see that the text at the lower left corner<br />   of the image properly changes according to which area you are over. If<br />   you resize the image to 300x300 the messages are wrong because only<br />   the image, not the area coordinates, have been rescaled.<br /><br />   If the option<br /><br />      COORDSCALE=&quot;ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE&quot;<br /><br />   or<br /><br />      COORDSCALE=&quot;TOPIXEL|TODISPLAYED&quot;<br />        <br />   was added to the MAP element, with &quot;TODISPLAYED&quot; being the default,<br />   you could support the new scalability without breaking current maps.<br /><br />   What purpose would this serve? I often want to make an image size<br />   adjustable by the viewer to improve accessibility (large images are<br />   easier to see, smaller images accommodate limited mobility). It is<br />   also useful to be able to adjust image sizes to fit different browser<br />   window sizes, such as the smaller displays often found on portable<br />   devices.<br /><br />   It is possible to maintain multiple maps and to change the USEMAP=<br />   value using JavaScript for a limited set of sizes; but that is a large<br />   amount of work.<br /><br />   In a related vein,<br />     * If it was required that a browser that does not display images (or<br />       one that can but has images suppressed) use the MAP/AREA<br />       information to make a list of the same information either as a<br />       menu or a simple UL-type list that would make it simpler for<br />       developers who often have to duplicate the links in an image map<br />       somewhere else to support non-graphic browsers. lynx(1) and w3m(1)<br />       already do an excellent job of that, using the alt=&quot;&quot; values<br />       supplied in the AREA definitions; but that is not something you<br />       are sure you can depend on because it is not in the HTML<br />       specification. If developers knew it would be supported they could<br />       eliminate the duplicate menus you often see on pages with image<br />       maps.<br />     * it is not clear to me whether a CANVAS element will or will not<br />       support a MAP? It would be useful if it did; and it would then be<br />       even more important that CANVAS support an even-odd fill for<br />       polygons to match the fill style used by AREA.<br /><br />   As of Feb 23, 2008 if I remove the name=&quot;letters&quot; from the MAP element<br />   this page will not work in safari(1); but it works in opera(1),<br />   iexplore(1), and firefox(1). The HTML5 validator says name=&quot;&quot; is not<br />   yet part of HTML5.<br /><br />References<br /><br />   1.
