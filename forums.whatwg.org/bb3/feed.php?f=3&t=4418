You're welcome to replace the forum software with something better, but you'd have to coordinate that with Hixie yourself and make sure that it is properly patched against automated spam (what we have now already is). His email is <!-- e --><a href="mailto:ian@hixie.ch">ian@hixie.ch</a><!-- e -->, tell him that I have given an OK (although I would prefer the new version to be set up on a separate subdomain first before switching so that we don't lose any data or end up half-migrating etc).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Mon Sep 13, 2010 8:17 pm</p><hr />

This content should also be available to as wide an audience as possible.<br /><br />This forum is a few years old, but it has served us pretty well. It's goal is to facilitate communication, feedback, etc. not be a 'showcase' of HTML5.<br /><br />You might also find that Ian has other commitments at work - it's not like he's sitting at Google (not the W3C) working on HTML5 all day.<br /><br />The others who contribute and assist in the maintenance of this board are volunteers - who have full time jobs, family commitments, etc. There is no hiring of people involved.<br /><br />Regarding your feature propositions, I would suggest reading this and updating your post as necessary:<br /><a href="http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?t=41" class="postlink">http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?t=41</a><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Mike<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=125">mskinner</a> — Mon Sep 13, 2010 8:47 am</p><hr />

I like the idea of a rich text editor element or some sort of standardization.<br /><br />I have a few disagreements with HTML5 though I can tell you creating specifications is probably not a walk in the park. More decisions could be made like keeping H.264 from getting established on the web to screw over consumers and the HTML5 group has not taken the stance they need to in order to prevent politics from being an issue.<br /><br />What is the point of having input elements for audio and video when there are already audio and video elements?<br /><br />You can't underline things with a u tag because that is only half of the u <span style="font-style: italic">element</span>. Your post was not the most friendly one that I've read here so far and using the wrong terminology on top of the tone of your post doesn't really help. Post your disagreements and see what people say first and you may find there are legitimate reasons for why things are done in a certain manner. I would say I don't agree with all decisions easily though they tend to be more of a political nature.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Mon Sep 13, 2010 8:45 am</p><hr />
