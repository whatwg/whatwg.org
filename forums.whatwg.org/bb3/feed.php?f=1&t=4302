<title type="html"><![CDATA[My Experience of HTML5]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/viewtopic.php?t=4302&amp;p=5887#p5887"><![CDATA[
Well I decided that I would do an article on HTML5, but have to admit I approached the subject well to be honest totally negatively. I had spent time learning XHTML and then making sites strict XHTML, done semantic structures , been told javascript was bad, then told it was good, and well to be honest felt like it was all a complete waste of time. <br /><br />Another bloody web standard I thought after wasting time turning &lt;b&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;, as I read HTML5 I  cursed to myself &quot;great now there saying &lt;b&gt; is OK again (never thought their was anything wrong in the first place).&quot;<br /><br />Then as I delved into the history of HTML5 , I thought, hang on these guys are saying the things I felt back then. Mark Pilgrims rant on W3C (very funny) and even the formation of WHATWG I recognised was born out of a frustration of where XHTML was heading.<br /><br />Slowly my opinion changed and as I started to read about common tasks such as form validation being shifted to the browser I was hooked. The more I read the more I fell in love with HTML5. Or should we say &quot;lego&quot; instead of &quot;love&quot;.<br /><br />By the end of the article I dumped my Strict XHTML Doctype that was so complicated I can no longer remember it and put up &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.<br /><br />Great work guys. I am now a HTML5 lego'er.........<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1170">onlineconnect</a> — Wed May 19, 2010 12:44 am</p><hr />
