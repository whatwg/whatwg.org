As some of the comments there, try to use &lt;object&gt; for a deeper and more comprehensive solution to what happens if you can't run your intended video content. May reallly need a fallback to just text that says sorry this video can't play. Also, isn't there the prospect of some intermediate fallback that anly shows when the node is busy getting or preparing content? <br />But if it works that is great and there is plenty or room to develop. <br /><br />Thanks Again and Best Regards, <br />Joe<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=508">joedw</a> — Wed Jun 24, 2009 11:55 pm</p><hr />

&gt; To summarize, the reasons you want &lt;embed&gt; to be obsolete are: <br /><br />Thanks for organizing this. Well first of all, this forum just killed the best most persuasive responses you could ever believe when the line dropped, or something. I will try again, but at least I calibrated myself to understand that this is not about how &lt;object&gt; replaces or subsumes &lt;embed&gt; because &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; do that for some specified MIMEs. Rather, just that perhaps &lt;embed&gt; has served its noble purpose and can be retired from the list of best practices.  <br /><br />&gt; 1. it is an archaic structure that uses syntax not found anywhere else <br /><br />Maybe so. I see better practice is &lt;embed&gt; attributes now. <br />name=&quot;value&quot; instead of a long string. However, it is hard to tell which are real html attributes and which are proprietary plugin attributes. <br /><br />&gt; 2. parameters with embed are more difficult to deal with <br /><br />In principle, it is the same info &lt;object&gt; a least lets us know which of the parameters are 'standard' attributes and which are negotiated interfaces. <br /><br />&gt; 3. many people using embed are using it with an object parent, which is ugly and unnecessary <br /><br />If an author goes through &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; and the improvements offered by &lt;iframe&gt; and still can't find the @type that needs to be interacteid with, then where should the landing be?

These include old browsers that ignored W3C totally concerning &lt;object&gt; and more recently old browsers that knew about &lt;object&gt; but would actually fail if they encountered @classid. In the first category, authors that support NS4 would then see that NS4 or earlier is the only use for &lt;embed&gt;, and authors targeting the second category could see that it is no longer necessary to worry, because recent and current latest versions of everything else are OK. <br /><br />joedw wrote:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />&quot;4.9.6 Page load processing model for content that uses plugins <br />... <br />When a resource that requires an external resource...<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />zcorpan wrote:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />It seems this is fixed already.

If an author is told about the actual very limited subset of browsers that are out there that need &lt;embed&gt; then the author would probably not use it. Also, although it is traditional to use that autogenerated &lt;embed&gt; element to open a new context there is very little chance that a the user will be using a browser that needs &lt;embed&gt; for this case (usually clicking a link with a recognized file extension). <br /><br />So once again, &lt;embed&gt; is obsolete for every case except the the very limited subset of all browsers currently out there. <br /><br />I think another great reason to obsolet &lt;embed&gt; is that it is the last remnant of the long string of pairs that sometimes are involved in &lt;embed&gt;.  The other use was in the feature string of .open and that has now been dropped, and in fact ignored, as I last saw it. While ignoring this string is probably not the best idea for &lt;embed&gt; it is simple to recode using &lt;param&gt;s instead.<br /><br />And, if &lt;embed&gt; is gone from this usage, then some poor novice won't view source on the thing and see the obsolete use of &lt;embed&gt; in the autogenerated code and think that is the good path. <br /><br />Finally, any use of embed can be handled by a straighforward restyling to &lt;object&gt; syntax with &lt;param&gt;s. Although some plugins are tuned for &lt;embed&gt; and vice-versa, no existing plugins will be excluded by not encouraging embed. And if there are, well then the author would know it and it would be OK because even though it is 'officially' obsolete, &lt;embed&gt; will probably be supported. <br /><br />I don't really have anything to grind about obsoleting this what is arguably a maybe the last artifact of the GBWs, but the worst thing that could happen is I get introduced to some current tools that actually need &lt;embed&gt;. <br /><br />Thanks and Best Regards, <br />Joe<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=508">joedw</a> — Wed Jun 24, 2009 10:03 am</p><hr />

With the current spec, would it make long term sense to:<br /><br />1. Obsolete using &lt;embed&gt;, especially as a fallback for &lt;object&gt;.<br /><br />Move &lt;embed&gt; to Obsolete, like &lt;applet&gt;.The only current required use of &lt;embed&gt; is coding around old browsers that refused to honor object and, for a period of time some hosting issues for weakly-walled content markup that was afraid of &lt;object&gt; without sandbox. The added @sandbox feature handles this concern in those applications, I think. <br /><br />So, from what I understand, use of embed anywhere could show non-conformance because but not fail and its use could be discouraged at author time.<br /><br />Yes, there is one spec requirement (following) that if I select a link to external content with MIME/file extension not HTML, and it has a player for that MIME, the browser should open a new window/tab with generated &lt;embed&gt; markup. (Is it clear how this context is related to the current browsing context?)<br /><br />&quot;4.9.6 Page load processing model for content that uses plugins<br />... <br />When a resource that requires an external resource to be rendered is to be loaded in a browsing context, the user agent should create a Document object, mark it as being an HTML document, append an html element to the Document, append a head element and a body element to the html element, append an embed to the body element, and set the src attribute of the img <br />element to the address of the image. <br /><br />These words should be tuned to allow any embedded content instead of just image and I think embed could be dropped and use object instead for this. <br /><br />Suggest content type resource defined same as &lt;object&gt; using served MIME or inspection. <br /><br />Suggest address of the 'img element' should be absolute URL of external content resource. <br /><br />I am guessing the biggest problem with this is how to answer the question: &quot;How do you obsolete something that was never specced?&quot; <br />Let's just skip that question and just obsolete it. <br /><br />Thanks and Best Regards, <br />Joe<br /><br /><br />.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=508">joedw</a> — Sat Jun 13, 2009 7:14 pm</p><hr />
