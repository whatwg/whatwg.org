I used to have this paranoid obsession with the target attribute. I felt I had to open ALL offsite links in new windows so that my users wouldn't navigate away from my site.<br /><br />Say no to drugs.<br /><br />It's not actually useful at all for that purpose, and it's just really, really highly annoying. I am a tabbed browser (huh?!) and I find it very, very annoying now when on one of my ten example.com tabs, I click a link only to find it opens a NEW tab to example.org. It's greedy, how many tabs do you think you need open in my window anyway?<br /><br />Web designers, please don't open things in new windows unless you really, REALLY HAVE to. It's annoying.<br /><br />I wasn't aware actually that Firefox had a preference for this. Nice. There are always userscripts, too.<br /><br />Firefox, like Opera, opens <span style="font-weight: bold">target=&quot;_blank&quot;</span> into a new <span style="font-weight: bold">tab</span>, not a new Window. (A blank <span style="text-decoration: underline">what</span>?) and that's not too bad. A whole extra window means drawing a whole lot of extra chrome, it's super wasteful.<br /><br />HOWEVER after bashing the target attribute so much and declaring my hatred for certain abused values, I am not against the attribute per se.<br />It has one very obvious use case:<br />IFRAMES.<br />We're allowed to create static windows, we should be able to control navigation in them from their parent windows. The target attribute is and always will be perfect for this; if you deprecate target make sure you get rid of iframe first.<br /><br />I will love you forever if you get rid of the <span style="font-weight: bold">_xxxx</span> values though <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=402">SneakyWho_am_i</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 1:46 pm</p><hr />

Why isn't anyone considering deprecating target all together as in XHTML. Just leave the choice to the user, that way there is no confusion as to what to expect from a website's functionality.<br /><br />There is the argument that some people are used to having pages open in a new browser window or tab without them having to act upon it, but I don't see how anyone would prefer an ambiguous web.<br /><br />Yet again, don't you go panick about compatibility. This is something every browser, even IE 6, knows how to deal with (right click, open in a new window). And besides, even if someone writes it in it's code, it's going to be interpreted anyway because of HTML 4 compatibility. That doesn't mean we can't make it deprecated for the good of the web's future.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Edit: Yes, I know some web functionality makes sense when opening a new window. Maybe we should try avoiding that interface design functionality, there are ways.</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=372">Pacoup</a> — Mon Aug 18, 2008 9:22 pm</p><hr />

And it would make sense to web developers. And there is a demand for it. Quite honestly, I don't see many reasons why not to include it -- you might be right that browsers should offer better configuration options and all that theory about browser/web app level is interesting but why can't we have both? target=&quot;_tab&quot; in the specs and the possibility to override those settings locally would make sense to me.<br /><br />Borek<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=301">BorekB</a> — Sun Jun 08, 2008 8:01 pm</p><hr />

<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary</span>: Introduce a new browsing context name “_tab” which would advise a browser to open the link in a new tab. Sample usage: &lt;a href=”...” target=”_tab”&gt;. Similar method should be available in JavaScript too.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Motivation</span>: Opening links in new windows versus new tabs is very different from the user perspective. Each behavior has its common use case – for instance, tabs are useful for content that you want to read later while new windows can be useful for help pop-ups etc. However, there is only one way to specify that the link should open in a new browsing context: target=”_blank” (target=”_tab” is missing). The same applies to JavaScript where we have window.open() but nothing like window.openToTab(). This is an obvious mismatch.<br /><br />Common answer is that the browsing context is a user preference, which unfortunately doesn’t work very well in practice. Let me demonstrate; imagine a large form with help icons next to each label or input field – I as a user know that I would like a small pop-up (possibly without the menu bar and the toolbar) and that is my preference for _this type_ of links. For links that point to external web pages, I might want to open them in new windows. And for Google Reader, I might prefer reading the items in new tabs. As you can see, browsing context is my user preference but is site-specific or even link-specific and therefore almost impossible to implement at the browser level. For example, if you want the ‘v’ keyboard shortcut to behave naturally in Google Reader in Firefox, i.e. to open links in new tabs, you have to modify Firefox’s settings to run in a “single window, multiple tabs” mode. However, this will cause confusion when some other website genuinely needs to open a new window (to display help, for instance).<br /><br />As the example above shows, leaving the browsing context up to the user preferences is a nice theory but in practice, web developers should have a way to suggest what should happen – although I agree that it should be generally override-able by user settings or by an explicit action (like middle-clicking the link). The demand for _tab context amongst web developers is clear when you do a Google search for _tab: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=_tab">http://www.google.com/search?q=_tab</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Implementation</span>: should be pretty straightforward as almost all browsers support tabs these days. Those that don’t can fall back to opening new window which is the default behavior anyway.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Compatibility</span>: The change is backwards compatible.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Related proposals</span>: There was a proposal by mpt about target=”_reference” that you can find here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2008-April/014564.html">http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatw ... 14564.html</a><!-- m -->. I feel that, although it might be a superset of target=”_tab”, this _tab should still be considered. Firstly, implementing _tab would be much much easier than implementing _reference (I would even call implementing _tab into current browsers trivial). Secondly, _tab is semantically stronger than _reference and is therefore more straightforward to use for web developers.<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Borek<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=301">BorekB</a> — Wed Jun 04, 2008 5:31 pm</p><hr />
