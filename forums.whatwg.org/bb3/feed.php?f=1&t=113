It should be clarified that the Russian validator is intended to validate (X)HTML5 and thus will have a couple of issues with perfectly valid XHTML 1.1 which I would recommend sticking to the W3C's (X)HTML Validator. However I always recommend trying out new things and I love validators in general. <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Fri Oct 29, 2010 9:41 pm</p><hr />

I have found the XML documentation for the messages going &quot;into&quot; the W3C validator but I have no idea what they look like coming &quot;out&quot;.<br /><br />Sorry...very frustrated.
