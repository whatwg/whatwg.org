If you're in a corporate environment with enough resources then (as much as I sip resources on a server while others are doing college frat drinking parties chugging until they choke to death) I think if you're looking for a cross-browser/phone/platform solution you may want to consider having this executed at the server side? I don't specialize in code mixing with media so I'm not sure what the approach would be specifically. If you're trying to capture a frame from a specific point in the video then if there is at least a cross-whatever method to determine which frame in the video has been loaded then you could make a request to the server for a URL that will pull the video, find the frame and return that (from the server)  as the background-image for the Canvas element?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Sat Sep 22, 2012 2:29 am</p><hr />

Oh, additional and possibly very relevant information:<br /><br />I don't actually need the video to play real-time inside the canvas, I just need canvas (or something else!) to be able to take still-frames from a paused video playing in a &lt;video&gt; tag, and save those still-frames on the server. Later on I will manipulate those still-images with &lt;canvas&gt;, but that part seems doable on most devices already, as &lt;canvas&gt; is relatively well supported, at least on the devices I've experimented with so far.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3641">Mikkel</a> — Fri Sep 21, 2012 8:31 am</p><hr />

I've been exploring what you can do with HTML5, and the new options like canvas and video, but unfortunately I've run into a showstopper: Canvas can capture still frames from a video running in a &lt;video&gt; tag quite easily, but I haven't been able to do this successfully on a mobile device - tried it on an Asus TF300 (Android 4.0.3) and a HTC Desire (Android 2.2) so far.<br /><br />The example is straight from w3schools (link: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_canvas_drawimage_video" class="postlink">http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_canvas_drawimage_video</a>), and works beautifully on a PC.<br /><br />Is there any way to get similar functionality to work on mobile devices too? Both devices support both the &lt;video&gt; and the &lt;canvas&gt; tag, but seem unable to use them both.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3641">Mikkel</a> — Thu Sep 20, 2012 11:34 am</p><hr />
