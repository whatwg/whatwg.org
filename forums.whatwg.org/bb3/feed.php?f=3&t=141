It is worth mentioning that as of this date, safari(1) renders points for polylines of zero length if the line terminator style is &quot;round&quot;; while opera(1) and firefox(1) do not. safari(1) does not render points if the line terminator is  &quot;butt&quot; or &quot;square&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=240">urbanjost</a> — Fri Feb 22, 2008 11:43 pm</p><hr />

The HTML &lt;canvas&gt; element features seem to be oriented more towards<br />displaying vector-based art than technical graphics; thereby missing out<br />on easily supporting a large number of users. Why do I say this?<br />My first attempt at using the element to support vector-based graphics<br />produced by a program that dates back at least three decades was actually more difficult to implement in a &lt;canvas&gt; element that it was on<br />an HP pen plotter many years ago. <br /><br />Even though I quickly became a fan of the HTML5 element because of the<br />ease with which I could interface with standard HTML documents and ECMAScript/JavaScript, I was surprised there was no built-in support for<br />dashed lines, Hershey/vector fonts, even-odd polygon fill rules, and points.<br />And yet gradient fill patterns, opacity control, image manipulation, and complex clipping regions were all supported (which I consider more advanced graphic features than a dashed line!). <br /><br />Yet I found I could quickly create server-side applications or JavaScript<br />functions that let me get around these problems. The document found<br />at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html">http://home.comcast.net/~urbanjost/canvas/vogle4.html</a><!-- m --> shows some<br />simple XY plots containing simple labels, dotted grids, and dashed lines.<br />This was done with the help of a server-side library, but the functionality<br />is all very plausibly portable to JavaScript functions. <br /><br />But everyone does not have routines laying around to do sofware-based<br />dash codes, ASCII text strings, and grids. However, it looks like others have already raised these issues except for the topic of points (although I don't think anyone brought them up together, pointing out that they are all common elements of any simple XY-plot utility).<br /><br />Since the other topics have already been breached, I'll make my point<br />about points!<br /><br />It is common practice in many graphic formats to represent a polyline<br />composed of a simple &quot;move2(x,y)&quot; or &quot;move2(x,y) draw2(x,y)&quot;<br />as a point. Another common solution is to provide a marker(x,y,&quot;name&quot;,sz) routine that can draw various markers at points.<br /><br />It is quite common for a technical plot to be a so-called &quot;scatter&quot; plot <br />where the data is marked purely by marker symbols or points. It is also<br />common to unpredictably have a polyline be just a single point. If dashed <br />lines are going to be supported, it is important to note that almost all dash code models support points as part of the dash-code pattern. Every graphing utility I can thing of supports dotted grids, and so on. Points are so common in technical plots that I strongly prefer<br />that a polyline that has no length is represented as a filled circle with a<br />diameter equal to the current line width or as a square centered on the<br />point with an edge length equal to the current line width. <br /><br />Inconveniently, the current &lt;canvas&gt; standard says to ignore a polyline with no length. This means any code drawing simple curves has to detect such lines and render them as circles or squares or give them a false non-zero length.<br /><br />If others have reasons for not wanting to render lines with zero length,<br />perhaps the solution would be a new graphics state option that would let<br />you toggle between the two behaviors.<br /><br />The other surprise was that there was no display list or object definition<br />capability. Simple plots usually don't make much use of these, except to<br />define a marker style, but I find them invaluable in nearly any interactive<br />program. <br /><br />All that being said, I find the &lt;canvas&gt; element a welcome and overdue<br />addition to the Web ( I actually liked VML better than either SVG or PDF or<br />CANVAS because there was a common editor, browser, and drawing utility immediately available that supported it, but I'm practical enough to know VML is now destined to be a proprietary MS-centric product).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=240">urbanjost</a> — Sun Feb 03, 2008 5:05 am</p><hr />
