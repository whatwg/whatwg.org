I thought I read somewhere that the intent for the next version of Mozilla was support native platform backends so that it could play video using Quicktime, DirectShow, Gstreamer, etc.  But that still puts us right where we were in the 1990's not being sure about what codecs people can view.<br /><br />I'm quite a big open source/open standards advocate, but sometimes open standards aren't free.  I don't care how much Theora is improved, if it doesn't have hardware acceleration support to help with encoding/decoding, it's not as likely to be seriously embraced in next generation devices.  And since said next-generation devices already have hardware acceleration for H.264, it's unlikely that they're going to add *another* chip for decoding a non-modern video codec that has questionable quality.  I don't care how free Theora is.<br /><br />I actually think it's great that Google is bundling FFMPEG backend with Chrome, at least if that's their intention in the end.  I just wonder if they're also paying the licensing fees for an H.264 decoder.<br /><br />What will happen to FFMPEG and, more specifically, x264 come 2011 when the MPEG group starts demanding licensing fees?  Will it just not be distributed into the United States?<br /><br />Boy do we ever need patent reform.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=500">kepardue</a> — Thu Jun 11, 2009 1:30 pm</p><hr />

How can Chrome do this without incurring licensing fees for an H.264 decoder?  Will they just subsidize the cost come 2011?<br /><br />More importantly, is there any kind of licensing loophole that would eventually also allow Mozilla to support H.264 out of the box, without having to depend on platform frameworks?  It sure would be nice if sometime between now and 2011 the patent holders would decide to allow software makers to implement the H.264 decoder only without licensing cost.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=500">kepardue</a> — Wed Jun 03, 2009 1:46 pm</p><hr />
