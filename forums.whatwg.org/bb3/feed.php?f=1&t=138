I'd represent it in html4 like this:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />In XML it's acceptable to draw it like this:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;td /&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />I think that RobS was saying that he'd always use two tags to represent the empty element <span style="font-weight: bold">except</span> in HTML5.<br />Personally I'd not add a closing tag for elements that don't need it. For example the img element should not be represented this way in your markup:<br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</code></dd></dl><br />because as hixie said, &quot;it's unambiguous that &lt;img&gt; is an empty element, just by nature of it being an &lt;img&gt; element&quot;. That may make HTML look very yucky and inconsistent, but it works. The closing tag is implied by its starting tag, so if you wrote a closing tag into your markup you'd be closing an element that wasn't open.<br /><br />In XML we have to close it and we use the slash of death, but only because if we left it open the XML parser would eat our faces. We don't want that.<br /><br />I say: If the element can have content (like td) then close it with separate opening and closing tags. This will prevent weird situations like in Webkit where you see a self-closing div tag in an html document and it opens a div but never closes it.<br />I also say: If the element can't have content (like hr, img etc) then let it be self closing (at least if there's any chance that your document will ever be read by an XML parser) or just write it the ancient and original HTML way (if it can never be XML)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=402">SneakyWho_am_i</a> — Mon Mar 02, 2009 12:18 pm</p><hr />
