I would certainly recommend addressing this in the mailing list, where you may get more reception from the key players @ WHATWG <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/whatwg-16.png" alt=":whatwg:" title="WHATWG:" /> . Maybe even shoot an e-mail to Ian himself (he barely has time to use these forums from what I understand).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Thu Jun 23, 2011 8:27 pm</p><hr />
