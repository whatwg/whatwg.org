This is a good thing I guess and I don't know why MS wouldn't want to build that into IE as it would make their browser more forward compatible as well.<br /><br />If I understand this correctly then this feature also offers the possibility to create custom elements. Not elements that have a semantic value, but more <span style="font-style: italic">&lt;div&gt;</span>-/<span style="font-style: italic">&lt;span&gt;</span>-like. This can be great, but it can also be the path to invalid tag soup. If all kinds of applications that are incorporated in a website (internal site search, cms, etc.) use their own custom elements, it can become very messy again.<br />Is this something that has been considered or am I just a bit too pessimistic here? <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=87">Sander Aarts</a> — Thu May 17, 2007 2:54 am</p><hr />

Hmm, yeah but you probably also want to look for &quot;Anything else&quot; in various places in the tree construction section.<br /><br />You also mentioned attribute values, which are just inserted as specified per HTML5. So &lt;input type=foo&gt; will have the value &quot;foo&quot;, but still be treated as if it was &quot;text&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Tue May 15, 2007 1:11 am</p><hr />

Currently, the market leading browser (Internet Explorer) does not apply CSS to unrecognised elements. Also, its DOM is somewhat messed up for elements which are not recognised.<br /><br />In Firefox, CSS is applied to unrecognised elements. AFAICT, the DOM they produce is correct. This seems like a useful feature, particularly as HTML specifications usually add some new elements with each update.<br /><br />I would propose that an HTML5 UA should treat unrecognised elements in such a way that they respond to CSS and are added to the DOM sanely (e.g. future sectioning and grouping elements). I would also propose that unrecognised attributes be selectable via CSS and work in the DOM (e.g. future <span style="font-weight: bold">type</span> values for <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;input&gt;</span>).<br /><br />This would make HTML5 UAs more forwards compatible. If more elements and attributes are added to HTML at a later time, they would more or less work in HTML5 UAs. Firefox already seems to implement this, as mentioned.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=27">Cerbera</a> — Mon May 14, 2007 4:46 am</p><hr />
