<title type="html"><![CDATA[Proposal: Multiple Input Devices, GPS Sensors]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/viewtopic.php?t=49&amp;p=214#p214"><![CDATA[
<span style="font-weight: bold">* What is the problem you are trying to solve?</span><br />Future devices have multiple input device and sensors (multi-touch screens (iPhone), acceleration sensors (Wii), gps sensor) and this data/events should be accessable with ecmascript in a crossbrowser way. Keycodes are not enough, because they are only 1/0.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* What is the feature you are suggesting to help solve it?</span><br />It would possible to improve the usability of homepages for users which use the www on small devices without mouse or keyboard but with an embedded acceleration sensor and a multi-touch screen. I don't think about the iPhone in special, but also Tablet Pc's and devices mobile phones with GPS sensors. So it would also be possible to create web-based navigation devices.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* What is the processing model for that feature, including error handling? This should be very clear, including things such A javascript object, like the as event timing if the feature involves events</span><br /><br />A javascript object, where a listener could be subscribed to, for <br />- x/y acceleration (for example Wii-Mote)<br />- x/y position (for example Joysticks)<br />- multipoint (which are many x/y positions, for example Lenovo X41)<br />- gps position (for example embedded in mobile phones)<br /><br />I haven't invested time in thinking about event timing or error handling, but could if somebody likes the porposal.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* Why do you think browsers would implement this feature?</span><br />No direct pressure. But I think the parties behind IE or Firefox would want to create location based advertisment. There is also a privacy issue around if the browser exposes your exact position. I think that could be solved by displaying warning messages and ssl certificate checks. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* Why do you think authors would use this feature?</span><br />Because they could improve the usability of their websites. If the GPS sensor is accessable in javascript, location based services become possible. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* What evidence is there that this feature is desparately needed?</span><br />3D acceleration sensors are already built in in many devices (Nokia 5500, Sharp V603SH, Nintendo Wii)<br />Users can't deal with the added complexity by the limited input devices. Browsing the www or reading the mail on the phone is no fun.<br /><br />In case you ask, I have no monetary interest in that, I'm just a student dreaming of an web based e-mail where I can flip through by tilting the phone and a canvas drawing area where I can draw with 3 fingers and post it to a blog <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Greetings, Chris<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=90">chrisd</a> â€” Wed May 09, 2007 3:11 pm</p><hr />
