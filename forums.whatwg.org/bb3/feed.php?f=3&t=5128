Hi Guys!<br /><br />I just sent this proposal off to the mailing list, but was wondering what everyone else thought of it.<br /><br />I am a fairly amateur web-designer, but my partner teaches web-programming as his livelihood.<br />Introductions aside, there are a few things that bug me about coding, the following is one of them:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />I wish to make the following suggestions on web standards.<br /><br />When linking to external .css and .js the following tags are often used:<br /><br />.css:<br />&lt;link href=&quot;http://www.yourURL.com/cssfile.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />.js:<br />&lt;script src=&quot;http://www.yourURL.com.jsfile.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />both of these methods for linking external .css and .js work.<br />both also make sense if you understand the history of web development.<br />that is, .css and .js are both differenf technologies.<br />both evolved seperately and have their own history.<br /><br />however, todays standards integrate html, css &amp; javascript.<br />there is an ongoing commitment in the online community to provide better coding standards.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />This issue really gets on my goat as, yes, as a Kopimist I like to CTRL + C &amp; CTRL + V my code.<br />I also am one of those people that likes to code everything in notepad++ (I &lt;3 the note-tabs).<br /><br />I went and proposed this to the mailing list:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />so, why not the following?<br /><br />&lt;link href=&quot;http://www.yourURL.com.jsfile.js&quot; rel=&quot;javascript&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />or<br /><br />&lt;style src=&quot;http://www.yourURL.com/cssfile.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/style&gt;<br /><br />neither of these work, because as it stands neither language has implemented these.<br /><br />so, what I wanted to propose that both be implemented to help evolve web standards.<br /><br />&lt;link href=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; /&gt; could be used for both .css and .js files hosted externally.<br />href meaning hypertext reference.<br />this could open up linking to styles and scripts on other peoples servers.<br />in this way it aids collaboration between online communities.<br /><br />&lt;script src=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; would remain as it is, and its preferred use be for embedded script content.<br />&lt;style src=&quot;&gt;&lt;/style&gt; the style tag would have to adopt the src=&quot;&quot; capacity to enable linking.<br />other than that the style tag already works by itself for embedding content in the header.<br /><br /><br />both of these technologies are important and I am not dismissing either,<br />rather I wish to see both evolve to the fully capacity within which they could be utilised.<br /><br />the href would become a hypertext reference for documents outside of a persons own domain;<br />whereas src would point to sources hosted within a persons own domain.<br />this would also mean that people could do file/linking/short.hand instead of typing full addresses.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />What do people here think/feel about this?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3739">amyderpydear</a> â€” Fri Feb 15, 2013 1:04 am</p><hr />
