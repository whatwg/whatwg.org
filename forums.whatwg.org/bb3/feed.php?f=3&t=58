<span style="font-weight: bold">*  What is the problem you are trying to solve?</span><br />The current version of the HTML5-specification breaks backwards compatibility for noscript in XHTML5 by forbidding it's use entirely in XHTML serializations (XML Documents) of DOM5 documents. <br />The problem primarilly affects existing pages authored in XHTML 1.1, XHTML Basic or XHTML Mobile Profile that adheres to the guidelines of the W3C &quot;mobileOK&quot; initiative. By various accounts the number of pages at that follow the W3C &quot;MobileOK&quot; guidelines are growing fast, and the &quot;mobile best practices&quot; guidelines encourages the use of &quot;proper&quot; XHTML MIME-types and for example recommends against XHTML MP being served as text/xhtml.<br /><br />Furthermore, noscript is mentioned as a means to improve/ensure accessibility in eg. WCAG 1.0 and Swedish Governement Accessibility guide &quot;Vägledningen 24-timmarswebben 2.0&quot;. And even though both are subject to updates that will not explicitly name elements, several sites are still following these versions of the respective guidelines that explicitly recommends noscript for some accessibility purposes.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">The problem is that the current definition of script and noscript risks breaking XHTML pages that uses noscript for accessibility reasons while served as something other than text/html.</span><br /></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* What is the feature you are suggesting to help solve it?</span><br />Redefine script and noscript in a way that makes it possible to use noscript in XHTML5 serialisations that equals the possibilities to use it in HTML5 serializations. I.e. make sure they work in an equal way regardless of the authors choice of serialization format.<br /><br /> <span style="font-weight: bold">   * What is the processing model for that feature, including error handling? This should be very clear, including things such as event timing if the feature involves events, how to create graphs representing the data in the case of semantic proposals, etc.</span><br />The approach described in section 9 of the the OMA XHTML MP 1.1 Specification <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release_program/docs/Browsing/V2_2-20061020-A/OMA-WAP-XHTMLMP-V1_1-20061020-A.pdf">http://www.openmobilealliance.org/relea ... 1020-A.pdf</a><!-- m -->  is hereby suggested.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">    * Why do you think browsers would implement this feature?</span><br />To ensure backwards compatibiity (i.e. not risk breaking existing &quot;proper&quot; XHTML web pages) and not needlessly introduce diverging behaviour for a well established element only in documents served as application/xhtml+xml.<br />The pages at risk are most likely mainly &quot;mobile web pages&quot; that follows/needs to follow both current W3C &quot;mobile OK&quot; best practices and W3C content accessibility guidelines but all the same currently uses scripts together with a noscript alternative.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">    * Why do you think authors would use this feature?</span><br />noscript is mentioned as a means to improve/ensure accessibility in eg.
