There can be multiple CSS classes and inline style applied to a single html element. By the default CSS rule, if same style attribute is set with different values on top of a single element, the closest attribute value will dominate in the out put at the browser end. !important is a special attribute that can break the rule, and can force a particular style irrespective of the hierarchy of all the styles applied.<br /> <br />Here is the example, that makes it more clear.<br /> <br />- The following block of code will display the line in Green, due to the CSS class applied to it.<br />&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;<br />    .DivStyle{color: Green;}<br />&lt;/style&gt;<br /> <br />&lt;div class=&quot;divStyle&quot;&gt;<br />    This is content in the div.<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mindfiresolutions.com/Applying-multiple-styles-HTML-elements-and-significance-of-important--attribute-in-forcing-styles-440.php" class="postlink">http://www.mindfiresolutions.com/Applying-multiple-styles-HTML-elements-and-significance-of-important--attribute-in-forcing-styles-440.php</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1241">elizas</a> — Thu Jun 10, 2010 11:53 am</p><hr />

I tested IE 8 on XP with and without Quicktime installed. I confirm that in that configuration, placing a PNG in an object element does not work. A border is drawn around the PNG image. I revised my tests to deal with this. <br /><br />My conclusion: in light of how many installations there are of Quicktime, even if you are willing to develop your web sites with only standards in mind, and not support versions of IE older than version 8, you still can't use PNG files in object elements or many users will get a broken version of your page. You can use GIF files and JPEG files in object elements, however. I don't believe the problem could be eliminated by simply including a help file on one's site instructing users to uninstall Quicktime or how to reconfigure it into not breaking PNG support. Most users wouldn't benefit from that. <br /><br />In light of all this, I think it would be best to withdraw my proposal for the noimg element, and now do so. While theoretically a noimg proposal might prove useful to goad Apple and Microsoft into fixing the problem discussed above, in the end, I think we can and should live without the noimg element because in all likelihood the one remaining obstacle to object nirvana can get fixed, probably will get fixed soon, and until then you can use GIF and JPEG files instead.<br /><br />Thanks, Simon.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=474">ahagen</a> — Fri Jun 05, 2009 3:47 pm</p><hr />

I ran some tests, and have interesting news. I am finding that IE 8 properly loads all images from the object element, with no scroll bars, so long as the HTML has a doctype, or is XHTML. The example I linked to above: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.xml.com/2003/07/02/examples/object-demo-1.html">http://www.xml.com/2003/07/02/examples/ ... emo-1.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />is a document without a doctype. I guess IE 8 quirks mode places scroll bars around the images. Using browsershots.org, it appears that IE 7 places scrollbars around those images, even when there is a doctype. <br /><br />The image loaded from an object element in your IE test suite does have a doctype.

Test 6 prompts to download add-on software. For the others, it passes.

Excellent. I will send a comment or feedback to Microsoft about the object element. <br /><br />My conception of the noimg element is that if the browser is loading and displaying images (meaning that images are enabled), and the page loads an image but the image is corrupt, the browser would do what it currently does such as display nothing or alt text or a corrupt image placeholder icon, and that the noimg element would not be invoked.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=474">ahagen</a> — Wed Jun 03, 2009 7:31 pm</p><hr />

Nice points. <br /><br />As for wanting a fallback for a corrupt image, I don't see how that would affect the proposal for noimg. <br /><br />If I may ask, do you have a guess, or have you heard speculation, about why Microsoft has not properly implemented the object element in IE 8? <br /><br />I wonder why it isn't a higher priority. IE8 is really a very good browser. There is support for complex CSS selectors and more. It is reasonable, I believe, for many web sites to support no version of IE other than version 8. As a former Microsoft critic, I have to say I've been impressed with the standards-based turn Microsoft has taken recently. <br /><br />That makes it even more confusing why Microsoft hasn't implemented the object element properly as yet. Does Microsoft see the object element as a competitor to Silverlight or another of Microsoft's technologies? <br /><br />A solution for the problems I've identified in this forum thread would be great. As you have pointed out, the object element solves the problems. Implementations of the noimg element would take some time. As you've said, it is at least possible, if not probable, that Microsoft could fix object image support faster. But is there some business reason why they won't do that?<br /><br />On this general subject, I found a <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/13/object_and_internet_explorer" class="postlink">relevant blog post from Mark Pilgrim</a>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=474">ahagen</a> — Wed Jun 03, 2009 5:06 pm</p><hr />

They have the code for &lt;img&gt; already, and they can surely determine whether something is an image or not (they need to for &lt;img&gt;).<br /><br />&lt;noimg&gt; might not be so simple to implement. I presume that you want to show the fallback when the image is broken, too, not just when images are disabled. Now the browser needs to know which &lt;noimg&gt; element corresponds to which &lt;img&gt; element. How would you do that?<br /><br />Also, as far as I can tell, &lt;noimg&gt; doesn't offer anything new, and it wouldn't degrade nicely in existing browsers (existing browsers would show both the image and the fallback -- how would you solve that?).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Tue Jun 02, 2009 9:20 pm</p><hr />

I appreciate your reply. I didn't know that about the object element. <br /><br />The unofficial source W3schools.com states: &quot;Important: Do not use the &lt;object&gt; tag for images, use the &lt;img&gt; tag instead!&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_object.asp" class="postlink">http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_object.asp</a><br /><br />No explanation is given. It appears, though, that IE 8 renders the image with scrollbars. Perhaps that is why they don't recommend it. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.xml.com/2003/07/02/examples/object-demo-1.html" class="postlink">http://www.xml.com/2003/07/02/examples/object-demo-1.html</a>.

I think it would be easier for browsers to implement noimg than it would to herd the cats and get all the browsers to render the object element the same. Not sure, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=474">ahagen</a> — Tue Jun 02, 2009 5:59 pm</p><hr />
