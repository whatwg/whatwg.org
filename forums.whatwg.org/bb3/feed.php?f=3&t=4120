Hi !<br /><br />  I'am thinking a lot of defeat of video/audio tags. Defeat uniformity of  video/audio technology/codecs indeed.<br />  IMHO the problem is HTML 5 is too large standard. Nice thing in XHTML was that there was many small standards around XHTML 2. All was some kind of &quot;plugable-metalanguages which was optional. Many smaller standards made some kind of flexibility in this stuff. The wrong way is to made from HTML 5 &quot;Theory of everything&quot;. I think in some cases HTML 5 is a martyr of be a &quot;theory of everything&quot;. Pain because this standard is too big.<br />  In case of video/audio I think that is good point to think about new, small but extremely flexible standard. Call it MediaML. Goals of this standard is made a small, extensible language witch may include many different existing and becoming media internet technologies. This could be everything. From film to silverlight or flash ... Doesn't matter - this standard could be some kind of abstract layer for media in internet.<br />  Loading everything to one bag called &quot;HTML 5&quot; is painful. There are too many subjects (especially companies) with too many different goals in &quot;internet media improvements&quot; sector to include this in HTML 5. IMHO there are some &quot;weak&quot; sectors in internet and every standard which want to be flexible and modern develop should avoid this sectors.<br />  In this XHTML was incomparable. XHTML is small and rather use external meta languages then try to take new functionnality. The goal of XHTML was simple and make XHTML &quot;master in this thing&quot;. There are to many &quot;masters&quot; in media technologies in Internet to try promote next.<br />  Move difficult to agree technologies to different more flexbile standards. Make HTML 5 small as possible. This is the best productive path of development :]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=546">jan.koprowski</a> — Thu Jul 23, 2009 8:20 pm</p><hr />
