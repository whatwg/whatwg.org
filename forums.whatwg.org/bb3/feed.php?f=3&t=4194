This is a very useful feature used by search-engines, Wikipedia and many other sites that offer search-fields. But till now it needs Scripting. It would be really fantastic to have this great feature without scripting, so that it works for everybody, even if Scripting isn't activated.

Hi CasparLammy. Yeah, I was confused at first for two reasons, first I read a comment about this feature and the guy mentioned only Google and Wikipedia, and I immediately thought about general queries that are impossible to answer without an enormous database and previous search history. And second, I'm dedicated to work with the APIs provided by HTML5 and I'm so involved in that that I can't see a world without Javascript. When you start working with HTML5 (the entire specification not only HTML and CSS) you can see where the web is going and thinking not to use Javascript in that world is like thinking about creating desktop application without a programming language. Even today, the standard for the web is progressively including libraries like jQuery. Everything is going there, so since I'm posting messages in this forum I collide with a world of people that still don't have Javascript in their minds.<br /><br />I think that there are several tendencies in HTML5 that don't allow this. HTML is going to be just a markup language, almost exclusively for structuring (almost), the solutions are full solutions, not partial, and Javascript is one of the main actors. The feature you proposed is kind of violating this premises, adding complexity to HTML, avoiding the use of one of the main actors, and providing an incomplete solution (only solving the coding in client side). That's why I think is not possible to implement what you are asking in the way you are asking. It could be easily implemented with an API in Javascript, probably included in the Form API (yes, we already have an entire Javascript API to work with forms) but it could be considered incomplete without a source of data (like Geolocation would be nice but almost useless without the data that helps find people).<br /><br />JD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">macrojd</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 4:18 pm</p><hr />

I agree with Phil:<br />you need the same database, the same search-algorithms, the same relevance-sorting. No matter if you use &quot;classic search queries&quot;, &quot;incremental suggestion-search&quot; with JavaScript or &quot;incremental suggestion-search&quot; without JavaScript. On the server there is no difference. This suggested feature is about to use this server-feature (that you can see as blackbox and is in use on much sites today) in the client without JavaScript.<br /><br />And I don't see, why this only should be able to handle by big players like Google... PHP, Content Management Systems, etc. provide search-functions today. If there would be such a feature they would support that too, so that everybody who wants to use this, can use it.<br /><br />I really don't see any problems.<br /><br />@macrojd:<br />Of course there is a general discussion which things should be done with JavaScript and which things should be done declarative with HTML/CSS. Like Phil said: there are things that only could be done with programming (games,...). But why use Scripting for things, that also can be done declarative? This declaravtive way was the success of the WWW. You can use the web without gaming, but you can't use the web without the information done declarative. <br /><br />You say, less than 5% surf without JavaScript. I don't know, if this is true, but I know tht NoScript is one of the most used add-ins for Firefox. But even if it would be only 1% in the future: why reach 99%, if you can reach 100% ? If you print posters for your business, would you destroy 1% after printing? <br /><br />Features like the new possibilities for forms in HTML5 were also ipossible with scripting, but there were much reasons, to also implement that declarative.<br /><br />And if there comes a serious attack on Scripting, the number of usage can decrease again. I personally think, that there will never come a day, where 100% of users use JavaScript. Sometimes more will use it, sometines less. (I personally use NoScript and activate Scripting only on trusted sites like online-Banking, Mail, the pages of my university,...)<br /><br />And the declarative way would have more benefits than only make it usable for people with scripting deactivated. Even if every browser would have Scripting without the possibility to deactivate that, this declarative way would have benefits for accessibility (screen-readers,...), usability and maybe even speed.<br /><br />If this feature would be done declarative in HTML there is no duty to use it. But the webdesigners who want to have it that way, should be able to use that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1600">CasparLamy</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 8:49 am</p><hr />

after thinking for a while I realized that there are non general websites that could find this useful. Website focused on specific information don't need huge databases to supply data to their users. But I still don't see it implemented without Javascript. No because is not possible, but because there are too many things to configure and HTML5 is tending to provide complete solutions and low-level APIs to create easy to use libraries over them. It's like going in the opposite direction.<br /><br />I was looking for an implementation of the &lt;datalist&gt; element on this matter and I found this:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-html5-style-google-suggest/">http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-h ... e-suggest/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There I can see what were you talking about, but I insist, it has no sense to avoid Javascript when everything is going that way.

Hi PhilG. So what you are proposing is to have an attribute in the HTML tag to access your server but then implement your own database and scripts in the server. Then it must be possible, but without a standard information most developers won't use it. For example, Geolocation is good, but because I don't have to update the list of IPs necessary to detect users' location myself. Without that standard information available Geolocation probably won't be used by anyone. I think the same happens in this case. The most important thing and the most difficult to create is the database and the algorithms, the rest is simple and probably will be implemented by user-friendly API constructed over the WebSocket API and other like this, but then you will have to do all the hard work (and without any reference). Just look at the dictionary, how do you set the relevance for millions of possible queries if you don't have previous feedback. You simply can't do that, and that's the most important part of this feature, the rest is simple to do. <br /><br />I don't think the rest of the developers were happy because of the idea to implement a feature like you are asking, I think they were exited with the idea to have the feature and the standard information available, without having to do the hard work by themselves (exactly like the Geolocation API).<br /><br />And I don't think we should worry anymore about Javascript. This is the language of the future, in just a few years those that don't have Javascript activated won't be able to access any good application. At this moment the number of users with Javascript deactivated is less than 5% and continues going down.<br /><br />JD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">macrojd</a> — Wed Mar 16, 2011 12:41 am</p><hr />

Hi JD,<br /><br />of course you need to have a good database with relevance-info and search-algorithms on the server. And of course this isn't a feature for a private homepage with few pages like &quot;This is me, these are my hobbies, this is my dog,...&quot;, but for big professional sites like Wikipedia, and so on. <br />But:<br />there is no difference to today's situation, when you do this suggestion-searchfield with JavaScript. Then you need to have the same database, the same relevance-info, the same search-algorthms, the same sorting-intelligence, etc. on the browser too! <br /><br />It's only to have this feature that today needs JavaScript activated in the browser, possible also without JavaScript. Because users can have Scripting deactivated for security or whatever reason. Or maybe they are on a machine, where they even can't change this setting (school, work, library, ...) The server is in control of professionals, that can do it the way, they want. But you don't have the control, what settings the user has. Of course, for things like online-games, etc. you need Scripting. But such useful basic functions like search (even with incremental suggestions) should also be availabe for users without scripting.<br /><br />Big sites like Wikipedia, Google, IMDB, ... can make this feature that they're providing already today, more accessible to more users. Small sites don't need to use this feature, or they can use professional services, like they do today for providing a search box on their sites. And of course, the classic search without suggestions should be available further on.<br /><br />Greetings,<br />Phil<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1614">PhilG</a> — Tue Mar 15, 2011 11:45 pm</p><hr />

Hi PhilG. Let say your user start typing the word &quot;car&quot;. In your database you have this possible strings:<br /><br />&quot;cars the movie&quot;<br />&quot;car insurance&quot;<br />&quot;car reparing&quot;<br />&quot;cartoon&quot;<br /><br />In order to satisfy and create a useful tool for your users you have to order the possible queries by relevance. To know what is the relevance of every string you have to have previous feedback (it will take all your like do it manually yourself). Considering that the word car triggers billions of possible combinations, without a huge database and proper algorithms operating over previous feedback you will never know what strings have to be shown to your users and the tool will be completely useless. The reason why the websites you mentioned are effective is because they have big databases behind and billions of previous queries to give relevance to every possible string. Without the support of this companies the tool won't be possible to implement (not because of the database, but mainly because of the impossibility to establish relevance and make the application useful). You will also have to consider that the relevance and the possible strings change every minute.<br /><br />JD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">macrojd</a> — Tue Mar 15, 2011 11:03 pm</p><hr />

@macrojd:<br /><br />I'm not an expert in those things, but if eaxtly this feature can be done with Scripting, why should a pure HTML-version be so much complicated. The HTML only has to make the logic and the search on the server could be done with any technology, same like every other database-query. If you do any search on a website (imdb.com, Wikipedia, and so on) this is possible without all the things you described. This wish is about making this possible with auto-completion. What technology, language, database, etc. is used on the server doesn't matter, it's only to have this feature without scripting on the client.<br /><br />Without knowing if possible, I would suggest the following as an option that should work, even if other ideas don't work:<br /><br />websites can use traditional querys (like when you search for a movie in imdb and the server sends the results) -&gt; you send a query and receive the results. <br />To make this autocomplete you have to send every change (additional or deleted characters) to the server like it was a traditional query -&gt; the server sends the results -&gt; the browser shows them in a pop-up at the search-box. You only need to have such a HTML-element and a server that responds to it the same simple way as to traditional queries, maybe with some additions (define how much results has to be sent, etc.). This way should work the same simple way like a traditional query, only that you have (#typed letters + #deledted letters) queries. And like servers can handle traditional queries without &quot;billions and billions of possible strings stored in a database&quot; they sure could handle this.<br /><br />Again: it's only to have an existing (and very useful) feature without browser-based scripting. Of course the server can use any technology. It don't have to be declarative on the server, only in the browser, so that it also works, when users have deactivated Scripting.<br /><br />This can't be so complicated? Or am I wrong?<br />(I hope it's clear, what I mean, even if my english isn't that good.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1614">PhilG</a> — Tue Mar 15, 2011 10:48 pm</p><hr />

Hi guys. I'm not sure whether it was suggested or not for HTML5, but probably the reason why it wasn't developed is the enormous database and algorithms that has to be implemented to return the right information. You not only need billions and billions of possible strings stored in a database, you also need to categorize those strings to show them sorted by relevance. To establish this relevance you need previous feedbacks from users. There are only a few companies that can provide this kind of information and one of those is Google. Without Google support probably this will be impossible.<br />Google implemented its own API for search (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/docs/dev_guide.html">http://code.google.com/apis/customsearc ... guide.html</a><!-- m -->) but I'm not sure how useful and independent could be. And Google contributed before in this sense with other APIs like the Geolocation API (considered part of HTML5 by the community), that needs a big database to determine users location. But I'm not sure about the interest in participating in something like this.<br /><br />JD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1766">macrojd</a> — Tue Mar 15, 2011 10:17 pm</p><hr />

This could be done with a number of new attributes for form elements:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>&lt;form idletime=100&gt;<br />  &lt;input type=text name=query autocomplete /&gt;<br />  &lt;select name=type autosend&gt;<br />    ...<br />  &lt;/select&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />Should the autocomplete request path be explicitly defined by an attribute? Or should it be implicit based on the normal form action?<br /><br />The format for the reply seems easy enough; it could be a JSON array of suggestions.<br /><br />For greater extensibility, a suggestion could consist of &quot;a string, or an object with a 'str' property&quot;, and an event could be fired by the form when autocomplete results were received, with bare results or additional metadata attached to objects.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1178">nog_lorp</a> — Wed Feb 23, 2011 7:09 pm</p><hr />
