Lets say your coorporation has a large collection of button icons at<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://headquarters/images/buttons;">http://headquarters/images/buttons;</a><!-- m --> that you found a nice selection of<br />images for making section dividers created by a co-worker at ../../../graphics/png/bars and that you have created a multi-file document<br />whose content in layed out in directories chap1, chap2, chap3, and so on.<br />Your actual content lends itself perfectly to using relative paths. It is maintained locally while you are working on it, but releases are periodically <br />placed on a web server; so the relative paths are by far the best layout for<br />your actual content. So you cannot use &lt;BASE&gt; for the re-usable graphic<br />elements or you are forced to use full URIs for your document sections. This means you are forced to use full URIs for the graphics. But if you could use<br />BASE to create multiple named bases then you can keep all your graphic references much shorter, and much more maintainable. If the BASE names could be maintained in an external file like a *.css or *.js file, then if the image directory moves you could change a single file and all your image paths would be updated. This is just one relatively common case where being able to specify multiple BASE elements keyed to a name would make HTML maintenance easier.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=240">urbanjost</a> — Tue Mar 04, 2008 2:56 am</p><hr />

I don't really understand the problem. Could you elaborate on that?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Hixie</a> — Sun Mar 02, 2008 10:15 pm</p><hr />

================================================================================<br />* What is the problem you are trying to solve?<br /><br />  I find one of the most commonly broken links in a document (not<br />  including references to links external to a site) are the images used<br />  for &quot;styling&quot; and &quot;navigation&quot; versus &quot;content&quot;.  These types of images<br />  (used for customized list bullets or section breaks, for example) are<br />  by far the most commonly reused files by their very nature.  I think if<br />  there were an easy way to maintain a base URI for just such images but<br />  not other document-specific images and URI references that documents<br />  using such images would be easier to maintain.<br /><br />  Personally, I like to have a single directory called &quot;images&quot; with<br />  subdirectories called &quot;bullets&quot; and &quot;breaks&quot; and &quot;background&quot; and<br />  so on for such imagery; and find maintaining the pathnames to these<br />  images an issue because no HTML element really lends itself to easily<br />  pointing to these shared images and also to relative paths for the<br />  rest of my document (at least without using full URIs, which are not<br />  always accessible).<br /><br />================================================================================<br />* What is the feature you are suggesting to help solve it?<br /><br />  If the &lt;BASE&gt; metalanguage could be repeated with unique qualifications<br />  such as file suffixes or element types, It could make document maintenance<br />  easier<br /><br />  CONCEPT I: named bases <br /><br />     &lt;base href=&quot;../&quot; &gt;<br />     &lt;base prefix=&quot;breaks&quot; href=&quot;http://hostname/images/bars&quot; &gt;<br />           -----------------<br />     &lt;base prefix=&quot;bullets&quot; href=&quot;/../../images/bullets&quot; &gt;<br />           -----------------<br />             :<br />             :<br />      &lt;!-- elements that can reference images could reference the &quot;prefix&quot;  --&gt;<br />      &lt;img prefix=&quot;bullets&quot; src=&quot;sun.jpg&quot;&gt;<br />           --------------<br /><br />  I believe this or some similar extension to the &lt;BASE&gt; element would<br />  make it easier to maintain references to these reused &quot;style&quot;<br />  images.  <br />  <br />  Being able to define a base in a CSS class might be another alternative;<br />  then CSS style sheets and a CLASS= reference could do the same thing,<br />  and even let you switch between alternate versions, for example.<br /><br />  Basically, &lt;BASE&gt; is not very useful as-is, but could be with<br />  such an extension.<br /><br />================================================================================<br />* What is the processing model for that feature, including error<br />  handling? This should be very clear, including things such as<br />  event timing if the feature involves events, how to create graphs<br />  representing the data in the case of semantic proposals, etc.<br /><br />  The same as the current &lt;BASE&gt; element <br /><br />================================================================================<br />* Why do you think browsers would implement this feature?<br /><br />  This change is especially important for documents that are maintained<br />  in multiple locations such as stand-alone installations not connected<br />  to the Internet (that makes using full URI addresses for &quot;styling&quot;<br />  images or anything else almost impossible).<br /><br />  There have already been browser implementations that supported multiple<br />  general &lt;BASE&gt; entries, indicating the current implementation is lacking.<br /><br />  Otherwise, at some point &lt;BASE&gt; will probably become another deprecated<br />  element, raising compatibility issues and other problems in the future.<br />  Anything that is probably used in less than 1 out of 17 documents that<br />  has been around this long is probably going to be a headache. Why not<br />  extend it and make it more useful instead?<br /><br />================================================================================<br />* Why do you think authors would use this feature?<br /><br />  It would be easier to reuse images without making multiple copies or<br />  embedding them in documentation.<br /><br />  I think the &lt;BASE&gt; element is relatively rarely used because you often<br />  want your real unique document content to be hierarchal; you just want<br />  a base for reused elements such as &quot;styling&quot; images or audio. <br /><br />================================================================================<br />* What evidence is there that this feature is desperately needed?<br /><br />  The number of sites with &quot;navigation&quot; images or &quot;styling&quot;<br />  images missing, especially older sites (indicating this is an easy<br />  problem to have creep into your documents).<br /><br />  Actually, it seems there should be some way to distinguish between<br />  &quot;content&quot; images and &quot;styling&quot; images in general, which might lend<br />  itself to other approaches, but nothing more satisfying than this<br />  proposal has come to mind.<br />================================================================================<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=240">urbanjost</a> — Sat Mar 01, 2008 11:05 pm</p><hr />
