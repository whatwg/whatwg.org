I'm talking full OS GUI replacement, <span style="font-style: italic">everything</span>. The program/start menu, desktop, file manager, sign-in screen, control panel etc.<br /><br />A simple JavaScript API that returns an array of whatever application's commands would pretty much be the only thing necessary I would imagine thus giving access of the OS to the rendering engine. All that would need to really be documented was how to access the OS/application array/API via JavaScript I think offhand.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Sat Mar 05, 2011 1:22 pm</p><hr />

thanks for the advice, JAB Creations, much appreciated.<br /><br />Just to clarify, when I mention frameworks, I am talking about the means of a webpage to communicate with a desktop-based app, which can be thought of a sort of server. I totally agree with your statement about keeping it simple by avoiding layers of programming below your code. <br /><br />Your reply has also gave me some thought about the purpose of what is trying to be achieved by HTML GUI's.<br /><br />As I mentioned, it is to attract web developers to the desktop and to make GUI programming easier but another crucial point is to separate the GUI code and the main code of the application. <br /><br />This is desirable in two aspects. firstly, it makes the code easier to maintain and secondly, it allows people with differing skill sets to be able to contribute to projects. This would be beneficial in that the UI work can be left to somebody with web based skills which allows people with say C++ or C skills to get on with the main coding. <br /><br />I need to get the right balance of when to use web based technologies like HTML5 and desktop based ones.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1764">alsaf</a> — Sat Mar 05, 2011 11:56 am</p><hr />

Two critical pieces of advice...<br /><br />1.) Don't use junk code like document.write or innerHTML <span style="font-style: italic">at all for any reason</span>. They're not compatible with XHTML, they break accessibility and they're wholly unreliable.<br /><br />2.) Don't use frameworks as they add yet another level of programming, they're horribly buggy, they rely on junk code like innerHTML, they're not cross-browser compatible, they've exceptionally bloated and since anyone who knows how to trigger a JavaScript alert and their brother use it there are usually multiple conflicting instances of frameworks.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Any and all work that contains any of that should be completely null and void if you want your project to be considered reliable otherwise you'll be struggling with so many complications and issues that you'll likely just walk away from the project.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Three major pieces of advice...<br /><br />1.) Turn error reporting to the most sensitive levels.<br /><br />2.) Use XHTML served as application/xhtml+xml and fix parsing errors as you find them instead of years later because someone manually copied the code and ran it through a validator.<br /><br />3.) Keep all your scripts limited to two files that are only served via script includes in the head element; index.js (to at the server include individual files) that does not contains only functions and onload.js that contains your onload event anonymous function along with any global variables you'll need that may change with your user's preferences.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Fri Mar 04, 2011 10:00 pm</p><hr />

Just to give a bit of background, there seems to be a few web based frameworks on the desktop, the most mature ones being XULRunner and Pyjamas-Desktop<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XULRunner">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XULRunner</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://pyjs.org/">http://pyjs.org/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I haven't tried XULRunner but it is the framework that Firefox and associated products are run on. Pyjamas is a  framework where all code is written in the Python language. Again, I haven't tried that as the web-technology it uses, WebKit, needs patched to allow DOM Python bindings (not impossible but compiling from source is a pain in a backside). <br /><br />I recently came across the following tutorial which is basically runs a 'server' on the desktop which allows a Python program to manipulate a webpage run in a webKit instance much like a Graphical User Interface:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.aclevername.com/articles/python-webgui/index.html">http://www.aclevername.com/articles/pyt ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The means of communication from the Python program to the webpage is via injecting JavaScript into it. The web page communicates with the Python program by changing the webpage title (which the Python program monitors). This is usually done by a JavaScript onClick event. This code is as follows:<br /><br /><dl class="codebox"><dt>Code: </dt><dd><code>function send&#40;msg&#41; &#123;<br />    document.title = &quot;null&quot;;<br />    document.title = msg;<br />&#125;</code></dd></dl><br /><br />There is another alternative which I had toyed about with last year which is called SeedKit:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://live.gnome.org/SeedKit">http://live.gnome.org/SeedKit</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It was born out of Seed, a JavaScript interpreter which can be used on the Desktop and has access to GTk Desktop Libraries. It is just an application that runs a webpage but has access to the Seed JavaScript libraries. <br /><br />I had written an example which takes a folder contains images and displays it using the JQuery Cycle plugin.

My motivation is to create a framework that allows HTML front-end but the other major one is to allow web-developers to feel comfortable using the framework using their web based skills. From the point of view of a web-developer, what are your thoughts on the Python and SeedKit based options?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1764">alsaf</a> — Fri Mar 04, 2011 9:13 pm</p><hr />

I think that could be very interesting. You should keep us updated would be cool to see what you could come up with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1763">Xdega</a> — Thu Mar 03, 2011 1:27 pm</p><hr />

I've tinkered about with projects that create desktop apps that use HTML as a GUI front-end (think off it as a webpage with the desktop app as a sort of server). These are the same as Mac's Dashboards widgets.<br /><br />I like the idea of HTML front-ends. With my experience of mixing HTML technology with desktops apps the greatest benefit is the wealth of documentation available, the ease of creating GUI's and the flexibility of experimenting with new different types of GUI layouts. <br /><br />I've had a look at HTML5 and by the looks of it, it will be easier to create desktop apps with this technology. I was wondering what peoples views on this are?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1764">alsaf</a> — Tue Mar 01, 2011 7:19 pm</p><hr />
