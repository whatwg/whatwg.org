I know that there are tags like meta keywords and description that can be used to give some sense of what a given page is about.  I feel that is inadequate though.  Perhaps there is something new that I haven't found yet that will handle this...  What I would really like to see is an &lt;about&gt; tag that can surround content on a given page that is essentially what the page is about...  Is there such a tag in the standard?  If not, what would be the process for dealing with this?  For anyone dealing with search this is an important topic.  Parsing pages is difficult as it is.  Trying to really establish what a page is about can be very difficult even with meta keywords, description and title.  Anyway...If it is out there, what is it and what is the likelihood that it might get used?  If not, is there anything on the table that addresses this particular problem?  Having a tag that can highlight the content that represents a page's true aboutness would be really valuable.  I have searched on this but really haven't found anything on the subject that is helpful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2095">attakmule</a> — Sat Sep 17, 2011 4:59 pm</p><hr />
