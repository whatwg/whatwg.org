To create an interface to a database using a web page you need two program for both the client and the server. Client languages traditionally involve (X)HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the DOM while an example of a server side scripting language would be PHP.<br /><br />The place to start would be to determine how to program the server scripting language. Testing should always be done locally first, that is on a production computer and not a live environment. For a very quick (about 2-10 minutes) basic setup I recommend downloading and installing XAMPP. It has a control panel to start/stop Apache and MySQL (not sure how this would fit with your existing database) though you may only need Apache. You'll likely want to revise the website folder here...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Make a backup copy of the default configuration!</span> If your changes are successful after a server restart back that revised copy as well.<br /><br />xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf<br /><br />...which is listed a few times (DocumentRoot, &lt;Directory , ScriptAlias , &lt;Directory , (last two for CGI, unrelated to what you're doing)).<br /><br />Restart Apache whenever you make changes to the configuration file.<br /><br />Once you've got Apache/PHP running using XAMPP you'll want to experiment connecting to the SQL database using PHP.<br /><br />That should be considered the basic starter approach to your goal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47">JAB Creations</a> — Wed Jul 04, 2012 8:42 am</p><hr />
