hi there! welcome everyone. I thought it would be nice to say hi first to everyone and introduce myself.<br />by the way, my name is Jang Castillo... Actually, studying and using HTML is not my line but i got interested on it and other IT stuff when my cousin introduced and showed me his thesis. He developed a game of mind through the use of what he called PHP language.. and that's how i started. I got very interested on everything, from designs, games, Photoshop, animation, computer, programming, CMS, and other cool stuff. and HTML is one of that. I am a practical nurse here in Japan for training but soon i'll be in London to continue my profession but in spite of that fact, i will still continue my exploration on the IT World.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=728">jangcastillo33</a> — Fri Nov 27, 2009 6:04 am</p><hr />

Hi there! My name is Nathanael Ritz and I'm from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I've dabbled with all sorts of IT stuff in the past--mostly software. I spend a lot of time using Macs and a lot of time using Windows and I like both of them for different reasons. I know my way around Photoshop, Quark, HTML, CSS, DNS and a little bit of computer networking.<br /><br />I started getting involved with HTML on a regular basis in 2007. First with maintaining existing sites (which is often tag soup full of &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;td&gt; elements), and more recently with building some new websites from scratch.<br /><br />I'm not a designer (I couldn't draw something worth a pile of beans), but I can take someone else's design and use the right technical skills to make sure that pretty design shines. I'm obviously far from perfect and I am learning better and better ways to do things all the time.<br /><br />Part of that learning process has taken me to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/" class="postlink">A List Apart</a> where, based on reading lots there, I picked up how to write valid XHTML using the strict doctype. Such reading has produced this: <a href="http://ucalgary.ca/~sdc/" class="postlink">http://ucalgary.ca/~sdc/</a> Since finishing it, the content authors have gotten to it with FrontPage and some pages no longer validate. I don't handle any of their content maintenance but I was happy with the results since I actually coded <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> designed this one myself.<br /><br />That experience has brought me to HTML 5 and eventually the WHATWG community where I have learned how to write valid HTML 5. This has produced my personal site (which I use a tech test bed): <a href="http://www.nathanritz.com" class="postlink">http://www.nathanritz.com</a> and a &quot;real-world&quot; site that also validates as valid HTML 5 in it's entirety with the help of someone else's original graphics and design: <a href="http://www.o2mask.com" class="postlink">http://www.o2mask.com</a><br /><br />Now I am looking at learning JavaScript and advanced implementations of CSS using HTML 5 as the base. We'll see where this all takes me.<br /><br />Cheers<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=458">Ritz</a> — Tue Mar 17, 2009 12:34 am</p><hr />

My name is Tom Duhamel. I recently celebrated my 29th birthday for the third consecutive year. I consider myself a programmer and writer, although I don't currently make a living of neither.<br /><br />I have been introduced to the Internet in late 1995 and started creating web pages very soon after, which was very natural considering my two main interests. Being in the N/IE browser war, the necessity to follow a clear standard quickly became very obvious to me. I was and still write all of my HTML by hand.<br /><br />I have been working as web developer (among other tasks) for a (now defunct) web hosting company from 2001 to 2002 (as best as I can remember) and there added PHP and MySQL to my resume. After the company closed doors, I have been working as a free lancer for a few years, and eventually left the field altogether for lack of regular income.<br /><br />Recently (a few months ago), I went back to web development and soon realized how much I missed in just a few years. First, the XHTML I had heard about when I left was now well established as a replacement to HTML 4?!?! &quot;No way, I will keep working with HTML 4 for the rest of my life. Then, I realized something called HTML 5 was being written. That was January 27, just a day after the first draft is released. No need to say I have read that draft almost entirely in the several hours that followed. My interest on the subject have been growing for the next few weeks, and this last week-end I registered to both this board and the mailing lists. I also decided that my ongoing project will support HTML 5 (which mean, I will try to make it HTML 5 compliant, and will use as much HTML 5 as possible without breaking anything until everything is supported by the different browsers [and that IE users will finally upgrade from 6]).<br /><br />So here I am. I will follow the development of HTML 5 (and will never adhere to XHTML) and will try to use it as my standard as soon and as much as possible (can't wait for the stable release of Firefox 3.1).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=449">Tom Duhamel</a> — Tue Feb 17, 2009 2:25 am</p><hr />

Hi, my name is Chris (which in this case is the name of a male if it matters) and I'm from New Zealand. For a job I do.... uh... i do have one but I'm not telling you right now <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> and it's not going to make me rich this week if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm ... twenty one years old? Not very old anyway, I'm just a baby.<br />I have been doing web design stuff for a VERY short time; only really put my feet in the water in 2006. I never went anywhere near it in school because it was far too nerdy for a cool guy like me <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> BUT<br />Once I got started I acquired a taste for it like a fish with water.<br />I like to put together projects now with PHP, Javascript, CSS and XHTML. I like to serve it as XHTML+XML. Usually I don't bother to do any content negotiation (Sorry, Tim), it's just not worth the effort. Sure, I miss out on a lot of visitors, but most of them are not people I'm going to like anyway.<br /><br />Apart from (or maybe as part of) Web Design I'm interested in learning Python and/or C++ as well at some point in the future.<br /><br />I know a couple of names here. Anne Van Kesteren, Ian Hixie. I draw a lot from what you guys say. I don't have your pictures on my wall or anything, but what you say is gospel <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> mostly.<br /><br />In my spare time I mostly like to leave offensive messages on Microsoft blogs. I always feel guilty about it later, it's a guilty pleasure. I need counselling from all the pages I used to try to make work in Internet Explorer. I know, it was stupid of me, I should concentrate on coding for web browsers and ignore everything else. Opera Mini is quite nice and it would be nice if IE10 or IE15 could display my page so nicely maybe in the year 2202.<br /><br />I'm interested in HTML5 because:<br />- I can serve it under two distinct doctypes, thus reaping the benefits of the XHTML which I use and love <span style="font-style: italic">without</span> kicking out those poor, unenlightened souls using archaic browsers with blue alphabetic logos.<br />- I need a large throbber for my Ajax stuff. I'd rather not have to learn to use the GIMP Animation Package thing, when I can just use canvas. It's so easy and it looks so great!<br />- The Flash Player crashes pretty much every ten minutes. Actionscript 3 is a great language and I love it to bits but the player is a hunk of junk. I'm confident that audio and video elements will greatly improve my browsing experience five years from now when people stop embedding horrible, nasty plugins in their pages to play horrible, nasty music.<br />- getElementsByClassName() ... Yay, it's about time! <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />- It's got a 5 in it, the 5th version of anything is always worth sitting up and paying attention to.<br />- because.... because it's there! Where was it in 2004!?<br /><br /><br />XHTML 2 had a lot of bad points, but if I don't get scolded out of this forum then I would like to very gently push for some of the more innovative and clever parts to be included in HTML 5. I hope that more of XHTML2 can be brought into HTML5 without breaking the web, such as any-element-links and any-element-images.<br /><br />And, finally.. I'm here just to hang around the cool kids.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=402">SneakyWho_am_i</a> — Wed Oct 08, 2008 2:12 pm</p><hr />

This year will mark my 15th anniversary on the net, as a user and an author.<br /><br />I recognise a couple of names. Anne van Kesteren, for instance. I've read your blog and favour the desktop web browser created by your current employer. I like people with strong opinions. <br /><br />And Sander Aarts, it's possible that we're colleagues due to a recent merger of our companies. If so, hi! (There's bound to be more people with that name than the one I know <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> )<br /><br />Those interested in what I'm working on at any given moment (in relation to web development), can <a href="http://my.opera.com/OmegaJunior/" class="postlink">read my blog</a> or browse the <a href="http://www.omegajunior.net/code/" class="postlink">coding section of my site</a>.<br /><br />Cheers!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=181">OmegaJunior</a> — Sun Oct 07, 2007 2:18 pm</p><hr />
