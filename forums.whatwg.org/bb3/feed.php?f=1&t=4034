Kaazing Founder Jonas Jacobi to speak on HTML 5, Comet, WebSockets, Future of the Web<br /><br />Bangalore, December 10, 2008: Web applications have traditionally been seen as second tier citizens in our network infrastructure, not capable of fully participating in the back-end message infrastructure due to its stateless architecture. The founder of Kaazing, Jonas Jacobi, is coming this summer to India's biggest summit for the developer ecosystem - Great Indian Developer Summit (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.developersummit.com/">http://www.developersummit.com/</a><!-- m -->) to speak on HTML 5 WebSockets, the one innovation, in particular, that will enable full-duplex HTTP communication, and finally bring an end to the tired 'click and wait' paradigm traditionally associated with the Web, and allow browsers to become first class citizens in our network. <br /><br />The author of 'Pro JSF and Ajax: Building Rich Internet Components' says that prior to the introduction of WebSockets, bi-directional browser communication has been an elusive beast. Attempts to address this gap in the Internet architecture has circled around server-initiated message deliver or &quot;push&quot; techniques, commonly known as Comet or ReverseAjax, and typically achieved with an astonishing assortment of browser hacks. But with the emerging standards outlined in the HTML 5 specification developers can now take advantage of a full-duplex communications channel that operates over a single socket. More specifically, WebSockets enable browsers to open a socket connection to any TCP-based back-end service (for example, JMS, JMX, IMAP, Jabber, and so on) allowing you to easily create applications such as Web-based chat, and online trading, betting, and collaboration. <br /><br />The 16-year software veteran, who previously worked at Brane and Oracle, will also speak on the future of the Web, Web technologies, address the importance of browser support of the HTML 5 standard, and offer insight into the key role developers' play in HTML 5's proliferation and the impact on the end users.<br /><br />About Great Indian Developer Summit<br /><br />Great Indian Developer Summit, produced by Saltmarch Media (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.saltmarch.com/">http://www.saltmarch.com/</a><!-- m -->) is the biggest gathering of software developers from Java/J2EE, Microsoft computing technologies, Rich Internet Applications (RIA), Web 2.0, Ajax, Agile, SOA, and Enterprise IT. For both veterans and newcomers to the world of .NET, Java, and the Rich Web, the Great Indian Developer Summit provides participants with a well-balanced learning experience that guaranteed they went back with a richer understanding of the technologies that make a difference to their careers.
