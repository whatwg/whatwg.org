<blockquote><div><cite>fulg wrote:</cite><br />But this is the case only for the WHATWG spec, or am I wrong? Afair the W3C still wants to go with version numbers.<br /></div></blockquote><br />W3C HTML WG wants to publish a snapshot of HTML called &quot;HTML5&quot;, yeah. The W3C version of the HTML spec has stopped getting updates because of this (since sometime in June this year). The WHATWG version continues to get bugfix updates. I guess we'll see what happens with that.<br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />There tends to be a good balance of ideas between the W3 and WHATWG though I can't say myself, Z or another member might be able to point that out.<br /></div></blockquote><br />I'm not sure there's a good balance, actually. <img src="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />I know they would get rid of doctypes if possible and eliminate quirks mode if possible<br /></div></blockquote>Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />however most people for that are <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> supportive of application/xhtml+xml AFAIK thus quirks mode has to exist.<br /></div></blockquote><br />That's not why quirks mode has to exist.

It's just a means to that end. It is cheaper than not having standards and letting vendors reverse engineer each other (which is the usual alternative when there's no spec or there is a spec but it sucks or fails to match reality). Specs need to be unambiguous to do that, but removing ambiguity isn't the goal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Thu Jul 12, 2012 9:03 am</p><hr />

<blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />The 'X' in XHTML stands for extensible.<br /></div></blockquote>Yes... Though really it's just a cheesy name for &quot;reformulation of HTML in XML&quot; and the name &quot;XML&quot; could just as well have been &quot;MGML&quot; (Minimal Generalized Markup Language) if the vote about the name had turned out differently, which might have resulted in &quot;XHTML&quot; being called &quot;MHTML&quot; (Minimal HTML) instead...<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.totalxml.net/history-xml.php">http://www.totalxml.net/history-xml.php</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What's my point here? My point is that it's not useful to infer things from the name.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />That means <span style="font-style: italic">HTML5 features can be used in XHTML today</span>.<br /></div></blockquote><br />No. HTML5 features can be used in XHTML today because the HTML spec specifies that it should work and because browsers that support XHTML and HTML5 obviously also support HTML5 features in XHTML (not supporting it would be stupid).<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />Your users see errors if you don't code correctly.<br /></div></blockquote><br />Yes. Most people fail at coding &quot;correctly&quot;.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/">http://hsivonen.iki.fi/producing-xml/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />Good code <span style="font-style: italic">breaks</span> when it's broken.<br /></div></blockquote><br />No. Good code isn't brittle. Good code is robust against errors conditions and doesn't punish end users for trivial bugs. Good code informs the developer about bugs without punishing end users.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />If it doesn't then you <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> expect differences in rendering between browsers and they <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> be browsers you won't test and many of your visitors will notice though you won't.<br /></div></blockquote><br />application/xhtml+xml only gives error messages (to end users) for well-formedness errors. That's not the kind of error that gives differences in rendering between browsers these days. These days, browsers handle markup errors in HTML exactly the same (because the parser has been specced and browsers have implemented the spec). That doesn't mean it's a good idea to deliberately use invalid markup, but it means that browsers you haven't tested will produce the same result (assuming they conform to the spec) in case a trivial markup bug slips through your system.<br /><br />What is more likely to produce differences in rendering is browser bugs with CSS, mostly because the CSS specs leave various things undefined. application/xhtml+xml doesn't help here at all, even if your CSS is littered with errors.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />By serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml your testing if done correctly will easily catch these errors while you are developing locally so they won't make it to a live environment.<br /></div></blockquote><br />But it only informs you of a small category of possible errors. It is possible to catch more errors by having a validator running in your production pipeline, and that's equally possible with HTML and with XHTML.<br /><br />Also, many sites are dynamic with user-generated content and stuff included from third parties and so forth, where the &quot;develop locally, test, push&quot; model doesn't really apply. With such a site, everything might be well-formed and OK one day and be broken the next. In this scenario, it's not helpful for the site to stop working until you get around to fix it, blocking end users from using your site.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />Lastly the HTML5 spec is not forward compatible as there is no versioning.<br /></div></blockquote><br />Nonsense. You don't need versioning to be forwards compatible. You need defined error handling. HTML is forward compatible.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JAB Creations wrote:</cite><br />After several iterations of HTML are released it will not be possible to know what version of HTML an HTML5/6/7 page conforms to other than to validate it and that can of course validate as a version other than what the author intended or it may not conform at all to any version.<br /></div></blockquote>HTML has had thousands of iterations in the past decade, without &quot;versioning&quot; (well it's actually in version control, so you could say it does have versioning). Can you tell what version of HTML a page written last year conforms to? If you can, how is this knowledge useful to you? If you want to validate the page, why not validate to the latest HTML spec that has the most up-to-date bugfixes in? Surely the point of validating is to find mistakes? Why validate according to an old known-buggy set of rules (old spec)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">zcorpan</a> — Thu Jul 12, 2012 8:49 am</p><hr />

There is no such thing as &quot;the best way&quot; to learn anything, and that includes html. It all depends on somebody's personal learning style.<br />The best thing to do is look at a number of option found when searching for html and or css tutorial (no point learning html5 without learning css) and chose what suits you best.<br /><br />I would advice against w3cschools though; pretty dire as a tutorial.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3540">Benner</a> — Sun Jul 08, 2012 10:36 am</p><hr />

I agree with Z. At best that site might be an occasional reference point by experienced coders who know what not to use though copying the code from there is something I wouldn't recommend regardless of your experience.<br /><br />I'd recommend learning XHTML 1.1 served as application/xhtml+xml (create documents with .xhtml extensions and check Firefox --&gt; View Page Info or Opera --&gt; F4 --&gt; Info for media type). The page will break and you'll immediately know what went wrong without having to constantly/manually validate your code (except for duplicate ID's). XHTML 1.1 is compatible with HTML4 for the most part.

Looking for some advise on where to start learning html. I'm a print designer jumping into the web world. It seems that html 4 is the foundation where to build html5? Or better to start right on html5 and learn as I go? Thanks for any guidance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.whatwg.org/bb3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2026">lmth</a> — Wed Jul 27, 2011 8:51 pm</p><hr />
