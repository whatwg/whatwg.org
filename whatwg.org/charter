<p><strong>This charter is obsolete.</strong> It was written in 2004 and no longer represents how
the WHATWG operates. For a more up to date description read
<a href="/working-mode">Working Mode</a>, <a href="/faq">FAQ</a>, and
<a href="/policies">Policies</a>. The text below remains solely for the historical record.</p>

<div id="obsolete-container">
 <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

 <p id="the-good">Software developers are increasingly using the Web
 to deploy their applications. User Agents serve as front ends for
 server-based applications, and W3C technologies &mdash; including
 HTML, CSS and DOM &mdash; are often used to build user interfaces to
 these applications. Along with ECMAScript, these technologies
 provide a foundation for Web applications.</p>

 <p id="the-bad">However, the aforementioned technologies were not
 developed with Web applications in mind, and Web applications often
 rely on unintended features not fully described by the
 specifications. The next generation of Web applications will add new
 requirements to the development environment &mdash; requirements
 these technologies are not prepared to fulfill alone. New
 technologies being developed by the W3C and IETF can contribute to
 Web applications, but these are often designed to address other
 needs and only consider Web Applications in a peripheral way.</p>

 <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

 <p id="address">The goal of the Web Hypertext Applications
 Technology Working Group is to address the need for one coherent
 development environment for Web applications, through the creation
 of technical specifications that are intended to be implemented in
 mass-market Web browsers.</p>

 <p>The expected deliverables include:</p>

 <ul id="deliv-list">

  <li id="wf2">Web Forms 2.0: An incremental improvement of
  HTML4.01's forms.</li>

  <li id="wa1">Web Applications 1.0: Features for Application
  Development in HTML.</li>

  <li id="wc1">Web Controls 1.0: A specification describing
  mechanisms for creating new widgets that can be used with the Web
  Forms and Web Applications technologies.</li>

  <li id="cssrom">CSS Rendering Object Model: A specification for
  defining access to the CSS rendering tree so that applications can
  access, e.g., the active selection, and rendered ::before and
  ::after content.</li>

 </ul>

 <p id="other">Other deliverables may be found to be needed to cover
 other areas that Web application developers require. For instance we
 may work on specifications for new semantic elements that cover
 common scenarios such as those found in e-commerce, forums, Web
 logs, and games. The list of deliverables above is not meant to be
 exclusive.</p>

 <p id="back-compat">All specifications produced by this working
 group must take into account backwards compatibility, and clearly
 specify reasonable transition strategies for authors. They must also
 specify error handling behaviour to ensure interoperability even in
 the face of documents that do not comply with the letter of the
 specification.</p>

<!-- PROPOSED NEW TEXT

 <p id="back-compat-details">Specifically, "backwards compatibility"
 means that it must be possible to write documents and applications
 using the features described in specifications produced by this
 working group but have those documents and applications degrade
 gracefully in user agents that comply to older specifications. New
 features must either fallback onto older, less powerful but
 functionally equivalent features, or be ignored by legacy user
 agents altogether.</p>

 <p id="market-leader">In addition, it must be possible to write
 extensions to the user agent with most market share in such a way
 that pages written to use the working group's new specifications are
 able to use most of these new features in that user agent without
 requiring users to download plugins.</p>

-->

 <h2 id="process">Process</h2>

 <p id="list">Working group contributors will contribute to this
 activity through a publicly-archived and open-subscription mailing
 list. The working group members should also respond to queries from
 the public on this mailing list.</p>

 <p id="editor">Each document shall have an assigned editor. Editors
 should reflect the consensus opinion of the working group when
 writing their specifications, but it is the document editor's
 responsibility to break deadlocks when the working group cannot come
 to an agreement on an issue.</p>

 <p id="public">Specifications will be developed in public, with the
 latest version always publically available. During development, the
 working group may decide that a document has reached a stable stage
 and is in need of wider review. At this point the document will be
 archived in its current state, and a call-for-comments will be
 announced. Drafts in this stage should bear a warning informing
 readers that the specification is not considered ready for
 non-experimental implementations, and that experimental
 implementations of the draft must not be included in end-user
 products.</p>

 <p id="consensus">The working group can make a decision to publish a
 stable version of a document only if the overwhelming majority of
 the working group members agree that the document is ready.</p>

 <p id="implement">When a draft has been subjected to a
 call-for-comments in which no new and useful comments have been
 received, the working group may decide that the specification is
 ready to be implemented in Web browsers (both for desktop and
 low-end devices) and shipped to end users. At this stage, the
 document will be archived, and a call-for-implementations will be
 announced.</p>

 <p id="crec">In order for a draft to proceed past the
 call-for-implementations stage to the recommendation stage, there
 must be at least two interoperable implementations for every
 feature. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the following
 terms:</p>

 <dl>
  <dt id="feature">feature</dt>
  <dd>A section or subsection of the specification.</dd>
  <dt id="interop">interoperable</dt>
  <dd>passing the respective test cases in the test suite.</dd>
  <dt id="ua">implementation</dt>
  <dd>a user agent which:
   <ol>
    <li id="impl">implements the feature.</li>
    <li id="avail">is available (i.e. publicly downloadable or
    available through some other public point of sale mechanism).
    This is the "show me" requirement.</li>
    <li id="ship">is shipping (i.e. development, private or
    unofficial versions are insufficient).</li>
    <li id="real">is not experimental (i.e. is intended for a wide
    audience and could be used on a daily basis).</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>
 </dl>

 <p id="return">If implementation feedback warrants it, or if
 implementations are not found to be sufficiently interoperable,
 specifications in the call-for-implementations stage will be
 returned to the draft stage to address the issues raised and reasons
 for implementation differences.</p>

 <h2 id="member">Membership</h2>

 <p id="contributors">Anyone can contribute by subscribing to the <a
 href="mailing-list">mailing list</a>. The list of subscribers to the
 mailing list are termed the <dfn>contributors</dfn>.</p>

 <p id="members">Membership is by invitation only, and consists of a
 number of representatives from various browser manufacturers. This
 group, which is referred to as the <dfn>members</dfn>, will provide
 overall guidance as described in the charter above. The members
 currently consists of:</p>

 <ul id="member-list">
  <li id="anne">Anne van Kesteren</li>
  <li id="brendan">Brendan Eich</li>

  <li id="Hixie">Ian Hickson</li>
  <li id="jst">Johnny Stenback</li>
  <li id="mjs">Maciej Stachowiak</li>
 </ul>

 <address id="ian">Queries should be directed either to the mailing
 list or to <a href="mailto:ian@hixie.ch">Ian Hickson</a>, who is
 acting as a spokesman for the group.</address>
