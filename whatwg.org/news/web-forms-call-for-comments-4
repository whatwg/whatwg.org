  <h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr>

  <p><img src="/images/logo" alt="WHATWG, "><span class="date">Monday, 11th April 2005</span></p>

  <p>The W3C recently <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2005/02/Comment">acknowledged</a>
  a version of the Web Forms 2.0 draft submitted to the W3C by Mozilla
  and Opera.</p>

  <p>The WHATWG has updated the Web Forms draft and released a new
  call for comments. Comments on this <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2005-04-11-call-for-comments/">fourth
  stable draft</a> of the Web Forms 2.0 specification are
  encouraged.</p>

  <p>Comments should be sent to <a
  href="http://whatwg.org/mailing-list">the WHATWG mailing
  list</a>.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
  Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
  collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
  The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
  technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
  Applications.</p>

  <p>The Web Forms 2.0 specification addresses requests made for new
  features to be added to the Forms features in HTML4. New features
  include new input control types for dates, times, e-mail addresses,
  and numbers; a new client-side validation model; a way to mark input
  controls as required; a repetition model; control over form
  submission so that forms can be updated instead of causing the page
  to be replaced; and more.</p>

  Technology working group Web site at <a
