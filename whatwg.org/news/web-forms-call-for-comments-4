<h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr> calls for comments on updated Web Forms 2.0 proposal as W3C acknowledges Web Forms 2.0 submission</h2>

<p><img src="/images/logo" alt="WHATWG, "><span class="date">Monday, 11th April 2005</span></p>

<p>The W3C recently <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2005/02/Comment">acknowledged</a>
a version of the Web Forms 2.0 draft submitted to the W3C by Mozilla
and Opera.</p>

<p>The WHATWG has updated the Web Forms draft and released a new
call for comments. Comments on this <a
href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2005-04-11-call-for-comments/">fourth
stable draft</a> of the Web Forms 2.0 specification are
encouraged.</p>

<p>Comments should be sent to <a
href="http://whatwg.org/mailing-list">the WHATWG mailing
list</a>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
Applications.</p>

<p>The Web Forms 2.0 specification addresses requests made for new
features to be added to the Forms features in HTML4. New features
include new input control types for dates, times, e-mail addresses,
and numbers; a new client-side validation model; a way to mark input
controls as required; a repetition model; control over form
submission so that forms can be updated instead of causing the page
to be replaced; and more.</p>

Technology working group Web site at <a
