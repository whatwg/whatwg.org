<h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr> open mailing list announcement</h2>

<p><img src="/images/logo" alt="WHATWG, "><span class="date">Friday, June 4th 2004</span></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a
standards organisation. This submission would then form the basis of
work on formally extending HTML in the standards track.</p>

<p>The creation of this forum follows from several months of work by
private e-mail on specifications for such technologies. The main
focus up to this point has been extending HTML4 Forms to support
features requested by authors, without breaking backwards
compatibility with existing content. This group was created to
ensure that future development of these specifications will be
completely open, through a publicly-archived, open mailing list.
Working drafts of the specifications will be continuously available
on the WHATWG Web site. As the drafts reach stable milestones, the
group will publish snapshots for extensive review by the
community.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Software developers are increasingly using the Internet as a
software platform, with Web browsers serving as front ends for
server-based services. Existing <abbr title="World Wide Web
Consortium">W3C</abbr> technologies &mdash; including <abbr
title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr
title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> and the <abbr
title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> &mdash; are used, together
with other technologies such as JavaScript, to build user interfaces
for these Web-based applications.</p>

<p>However, the aforementioned technologies were not developed with
Web Applications in mind, and these systems often have to rely on
poorly documented behaviors. Furthermore, the next generation of Web
Applications will add new requirements to the development
environment &mdash; requirements these technologies are not prepared
to fulfill alone. The new technologies being developed by the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C</a> and <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">IETF</a> can contribute to Web
Applications, but these are often designed to address other needs
and only consider Web Applications in a peripheral way.</p>

<p>The Web Hypertext Applications Technology working group therefore
intends to address the need for one coherent development environment
for Web Applications. To this end, the working group will create
technical specifications that are intended for implementation in
mass-market Web browsers, in particular Safari, Mozilla, and
Opera.</p>

<p>Initially, the following documents will be written:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Web Forms 2.0: An incremental improvement of HTML4.01's forms.</li>
 <li>Web Apps 1.0: Features for Application Development in HTML.</li>
 <li>Web Controls 1.0: A specification describing mechanisms for
 creating new interactive widgets.</li>
</ul>

<p>More specifications may be added to cover other Web Application
requirements. For example, the working group may work on
specifications for new semantic elements needed in common Web
contexts such as e-commerce, forums, Web logs, and games.</p>

<p>The working group intends to ensure that all its specifications
address backwards compatibility concerns, clearly provide reasonable
transition strategies for authors, and specify error handling
behavior to ensure interoperability even in the face of documents
that do not comply to the letter of the specifications.</p>

Technology working group Web site at <a
