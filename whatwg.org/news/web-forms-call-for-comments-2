<h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr> calls for final comments on Web Forms 2.0 proposal</h2>

<p><img src="/images/logo" alt="WHATWG, "><span class="date">Friday, December 10th 2004</span></p>

<p>Comments on the <a
href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2004-12-10-call-for-comments/">second
stable draft</a> of the Web Forms 2.0 specification are encouraged.</p>

<p>The draft is considered reasonably stable and mature, and it is
hoped that it will progress to a call for implementations in a few
months. This publication should therefore be considered the last
explicit call for comments for this draft.</p>

<p>The Web Forms 2.0 specification addresses requests made for new
features to be added to the Forms features in HTML4. New features
include new input control types for dates, times, e-mail addresses,
and numbers; a new client-side validation model; a way to mark input
controls as required; a repetition model; control over form
submission so that forms can be updated instead of causing the page
to be replaced; and more.</p>

<p>Comments should be sent to <a
href="http://whatwg.org/mailing-list">the WHATWG mailing
list</a>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a
standards organisation. This submission would then form the basis of
work on formally extending HTML in the standards track.</p>

Technology working group Web site at <a
