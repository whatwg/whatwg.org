<p>The WHATWG develops standards and assists in maintaining their corresponding tests, thereby
fostering independent implementations. The WHATWG adheres to a shared
<a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.

<p>While discussing and working on standards, it’s always useful to keep these questions in mind:

<ul>
 <li>What do implementations do?

 <li>What do the tests reveal?

 <li>What should the processing model look like?
</ul>

<h3 id="standard">Standard<a class="self-link" href="#standard"></a></h3>

<p>Each standard (ideally) has:

<ul>
 <li>An active community of contributors.

 <li>An assigned editor and zero or more deputy editors.

 <li>A changelog. (A tidy Git repository with linear history.)

 <li>An issue tracker.

 <li>Corresponding tests.
</ul>

<h4 id="editor">Editor<a class="self-link" href="#editor"></a></h4>

<p>The editor has the following responsibilities, all of which can be delegated to deputy editors:

<ul>
 <li>Ensure any applied changes fulfill the relevant criteria for changes.

 <li>Resolve conflicts between contributors.

 <li>Reduce open issues.

 <li>Help manage the corresponding tests.

 <li>Ensure implementations follow the standard and vice versa. (The “don’t write fiction” rule.)
</ul>

<h3 id="issues">Issues<a class="self-link" href="#issues"></a></h3>

<h4 id="normative-issues">Normative issues<a class="self-link" href="#normative-issues"></a></h4>

<p>Problems with the standard are generally recorded as issues. Resolving an issue typically
involves answering these questions:

<ul>
 <li>What do implementations do?

 <li>What is the ideal behavior?

 <li>What is the lowest cost towards convergence? (Counting lowest number of implementations that
 would have to change as the cheapest solution.)

 <li>What do implementations want to do?
</ul>

<p>It’s not always possible to get the answers to all these questions in a timely manner.
Therefore, it might be the case that a decision is made even without input from all parties. This
makes it very important to file bugs for any spec changes (as discussed below), as a final check
to make sure all implementers are on board with, or at least aware of, the change.

<p>Additions to the standard can also be proposed as issues. However, the process for turning such
an issue into an accepted change to the standard is generally more involved, as the criteria for
additions is stricter (see <a href="#additions">Additions</a>). A typical path for turning such
issues into accepted changes is detailed in the <a href="#new-proposals">New Proposals</a>
section.

<h4 id="non-normative-issues">Non-normative
issues<a class="self-link" href="#non-normative-issues"></a></h4>

<p>Changes of editorial nature can be made, accepted, or rejected by the editor without
discussion.

<h3 id="changes">Changes<a class="self-link" href="#changes"></a></h3>

<p>Each normative change made to the standard needs to meet the following criteria:

<ul>
 <li>It must have support from implementers.

 <li>It should have corresponding test changes, either in the form of new tests or modifications
 to existing tests.

 <li>Implementations bugs must be filed for each user agent that fails tests. (This is each user
 agent that doesn’t match the proposed changes. If the test changes are not adequate to reveal
 that, but it’s known through other means, the tests should be improved first.)

 <li>It should have been reviewed by one or more members of the community.

 <li>Optional or implementation-defined behavior must be very well motivated.
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following more mechanical criteria are used to hone a change before accepting
it:

<ul>
 <li>It should match the standard’s source formatting and style conventions. (Consistent
 formatting helps new contributors know what to do.)

 <li>It must have a good commit message, with at the minimum a title, but typically with a body
 that includes pointers to relevant discussion, tests changes, and a more elaborate description of
 the change. (A detailed commit message helps folks in the future figure out why a decision was
 made. This happens a lot more than you might imagine.)
</ul>

<p class="note">If the change is proposed by a new contributor, the editor can ensure the commit
message is good, and help with formatting and style. There’s no need to make new contributors jump
through too many hoops.

<h4 id="additions">Additions<a class="self-link" href="#additions"></a></h4>

<p>Any change that represents an addition needs to meet these additional criteria:

<ul>
 <li>The addition must have the support of at least two implementers. (Such support is not binding
 in any way on the implementers, however.)
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following are strongly recommended:

<ul>
 <li>The support from implementers should be of the form “we would like to implement this soon”
 and not just “this seems like a reasonable idea”.

 <li>There should be no strong implementer objections to the new feature.

 <li>There should already be a prototype implementation or one being worked on side-by-side with
 the change to the standard.

 <li>New features should be something that cannot be done today or are such a common trend in
 libraries that standardizing them helps lots of people. Alternatively, the “new” feature could
 actually be a legacy feature that was not yet standardized, which is now being standardized.
 (Legacy features are often hard to remove due to web compatibility; standardizing and testing
 them helps improve interoperability and enables competition and refactoring.)
</ul>

<h4 id="removals">Removals<a class="self-link" href="#removals"></a></h4>

<p>Any change that represents a removal needs to meet these additional criteria:

<ul>
 <li><p>The feature being removed must either be not widely implemented, or must in the process of
 being removed from implementations.

 <li>
  <p>A test ensuring the feature is not supported must be added and existing tests for the feature
  should be adjusted or removed as appropriate.

  <p class="example"><a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/5001">w3c/web-platform-tests#5001</a>
  added new tests that appcache was not supported in shared workers, per the removal in
  <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/2384">whatwg/html#2384</a>.

  <p class="example">Adjusting existing tests can be difficult. If necessary, an issue can be
  filed instead to track updating those tests. This was done in
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/5053">w3c/web-platform-tests#5053</a>
  which accompanied the removal in
  <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/2402">whatwg/html#2402</a>.
</ul>

<h3 id="new-proposals">New Proposals<a class="self-link" href="#new-proposals"></a></h3>

<p>As described above, the criteria for inclusion in a WHATWG standard is rather strict. In the
initial stages of feature development for the web platform, such widespread implementer support is
often not available, or the shape of a feature is not yet clear enough for implementers to feel
comfortable pledging their support.

<p>In such scenarios we anticipate features will be “incubated” outside of WHATWG standards. This
could be in a variety of venues, such as:

<ul>
 <li><p>Another standards organization

 <li><p>A personal document or GitHub repository

 <li><p>A pull request to a WHATWG standard, with the understanding it will not be merged until
 the criteria above are met

 <li>
  <p>A document hosted by the WHATWG, but not under the spec.whatwg.org subdomain and not titled
  “Living Standard”

  <p class="example">The
  <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/CanvasColorSpace">CanvasColorSpace</a> proposal is being
  incubated on the <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/">WHATWG Wiki</a>.
</ul>

<p>In all cases, features that hope to graduate to a WHATWG standard should strive to follow the
above guidelines, gather appropriate implementer commitments, and have corresponding tests.

<p>Additionally, those maintaining such proposals should try to involve the WHATWG community, for
example by filing an issue on the standard they anticipate eventually becoming a part of.

<p class="note">Overall, this process of incubation can be very lightweight, such as filing a pull
request on the appropriate WHATWG standard with a proposal, and gathering appropriate implementer
support there. Or it could be more involved, such as creating a separate repository at another
venue and iterating for a long time there.

<p class="example">The addition of <code>URL.prototype.toJSON()</code> was rather straightforward
once a plan was agreed upon and upstream IDL issues were resolved:
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/137">whatwg/url#137</a>.

<p class="example"><code>innerText</code> was initially drafted in a
<a href="https://github.com/rocallahan/innerText-spec">repository outside</a> the HTML Standard.
Integration into HTML then went rather smoothly:
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/1678">whatwg/html#1678</a>.

<h3 id="tests">Tests<a class="self-link" href="#tests"></a></h3>

<p>As discussed in <a href="#changes">Changes</a>, normative changes to a WHATWG standard requires
tests, usually submitted to
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests">web-platform-tests</a>. At a high level, these
tests should strive to:

<ul>
 <li>Be automated

 <li>Test error handling

 <li>Test limits and edge cases, such as overflow outside the expected value set
</ul>

<h3 id="conflicts">Conflicts<a class="self-link" href="#conflicts"></a></h3>

<p>In case of a conflict among the community of contributors, the editor is expected to go to
significant length to resolve disagreements. In the end, they make a judgment call to pick the
best option they believe will have multi-implementer support.

<p>If a workstream participant believes the editor's choice will not have multi-implementer
support, and they cannot convince the editor, then they may formally appeal to the Steering Group.
In their capacity as implementers, the Steering Group may correct or uphold the editor's decision.

<p>Implementations can always override the editor by implementing something else. Whenever that
happens a breakdown in communication has taken place that the community should seek to overcome
and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

<p>Implementations that disagree can be rather tricky to sort out. Generally, we try to approach
these situations as follows:

<ul>
 <li>Find a solution that is mutually acceptable.

 <li>Research expectations of existing web content and specify the most web-compatible approach.

 <li>Align with the majority.
</ul>

<p class="note">A standard is a tool towards convergence, and changing a standard can often be a
pragmatic solution in case of conflict.

<p>Implementation disagreement should not result in implementation-defined behavior or optional
features.
