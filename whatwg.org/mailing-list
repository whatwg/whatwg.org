<p>Do you have questions on how to use HTML5? If you want to ask "how do I upgrade my HTML4 page
to use Web Forms?", "what is a web application?", "why does this not work?", "how do I use
HTML5?", then please use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>It is preferable to <a href="https://github.com/whatwg">interact with the WHATWG community
through GitHub</a>, with the <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/meta">whatwg/meta repository</a>
as the general discussion place, but occasional announcements and discussion will also happen on
whatwg@whatwg.org.

<h3>Archives</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/">mailing list
archives</a> are publicly accessible.</p>

<h3>Subscribing</h3>

<p>To subscribe to the mailing list, send an email to
<a href="mailto:whatwg-subscribe@whatwg.org">whatwg-subscribe@whatwg.org</a>, and then reply to
the confirmation email you receive. (Please disregard the suggestion that you follow links to a
web site; due to a limitation of our hosting provider, that site is currently unavailable.)

<h3>Posting</h3>

<p>To post a message to all the list members, first subscribe to the list as described above, then
send email to <a href="mailto:whatwg@whatwg.org">whatwg@whatwg.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Unsubscribing</h3>

<p>To unsubscribe from the mailing list, send an email to
<a href="mailto:whatwg-unsubscribe@whatwg.org">whatwg-unsubscribe@whatwg.org</a> from the address
you want to unsubscribe, and then reply to the confirmation email you receive.

<h3 id="moderation">Moderation</h2>

<p>The above list is not moderated. If you receive a message saying your message is in the
moderation queue, it means it has been caught by our spam filter. Make sure you subscribed and
posted using the right email address and make sure you didn't send any attachments. If you still
can't get your email sent to the list, please open a
<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/new">new meta issue</a>.</p>

<h3>Can I use +1?</h3>

<p>Please note that content-free agreement (such as +1s) have no effect on the WHATWG list and are
therefore discouraged. Editors of standards discussed in the WHATWG only consider the quality of
the arguments presented, and not the volume of agreement.

<p>You should therefore only post to the list if you have a substantive new point to make, for
example if you have seen a flaw in an argument presented so far, or have a new idea to contribute,
or have some information that has not yet been brought to the table.

<h3>Should I top-post or reply inline?</h3>

<p><strong>Please reply inline or make the reply self-contained, and trim extraneous quotes from
previous emails in your replies.</strong></p>

<p>Basically, please remove anything after the last line you have written, so that people don't
have to scroll down to find out what else you wrote, and make sure that your email makes sense on
its own, as it will probably be read out of context years later.</p>

<div class=example id=example-writing-email>
 <p>That is, you should reply like this:</p>

 <pre>Ian wrote:
&gt; What do you want?

I want cats!

&gt; When do you want it?

Now!</pre>

 <p>You should definitely <em>not</em> reply like this (because this requires people to read your
email backwards):</p>

 <pre>No

&gt; Is this a good example of how to post emails?</pre>

 <p>You should also <em>not</em> reply like this (because this leaves people to wonder if there is
any text lower down that you have written):</p>

 <pre>This is a bad way to write email.

Ian wrote:

&gt; Lorem ipsum foo bar baz.
&gt; Unrelated other bits that aren't replied to.
&gt; Yet more text</pre>

 <p>You should also <em>not</em> reply like this (with no context at all), because the reader will
not know what you are referring to:</p>

 <pre>No, I think that's a bad idea. It wouldn't be good for the readers, for instance.</pre>

 <p>Quote enough original text or provide an introduction yourself.</p>
