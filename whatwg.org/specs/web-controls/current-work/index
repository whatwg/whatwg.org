   Forms 2.0</h3>

  <h3 id="relationship0"><span class="secno">1.2. </span>Relationship to Web
   Apps 1.0</h3>

  <h3 id="relationship1"><span class="secno">1.3. </span>Relationship to XBL
   2.0</h3>

  <h3 id="relationship2"><span class="secno">1.4. </span>Relationship to CSS3
   UI</h3>

  <p>The CSS3 UI specification <a href="#refsCSS3UI">[CSS3UI]</a> introduces
   a number of properties suitable for Web-based application development.
   This specification expands on those properties and specifies their
   interaction with scripting-based environments and the DOM.

  <h3 id="conformance"><span class="secno">1.5. </span>Conformance
   requirements</h3>

  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a
   href="#refsRFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.

  <p>Diagrams, examples, and notes are non-normative. All other content in
   this specification is intended to be normative.

  <p>Documents that use the new features described in this specification
   using HTML over HTTP must be served as <code>text/html</code>. Documents
   that use the new features described in this specification using XHTML or
   other XML languages over HTTP must be served using an XML MIME type such
   as <code>application/xml</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>. <a
   href="#refsRFC3023">[RFC3023]</a>

  <p>(In other words, for the purposes of <a
   href="#refsRFC2854">[RFC2854]</a>, documents conforming to this
   specification using its HTML formulation should be considered HTML
   documents, but documents using the XML formulation should not be
   considered HTML-compatible.)</p>

  <h3 id="the-appearance"><span class="secno">2.1. </span>The 'appearance'
   property</h3>

  <p>CSS3 UI <a href="#refsCSS3UI">[CSS3UI]</a>

  <p>The exact appearance used will vary based on other properties and out of
   band data. In particular, the metadata and dynamic states described in the
   section on the <span>ElementUI</span> DOM interface directly affect how
   widgets are rendered. For example, a checkbox will look different based on
   whether the <span class="dom">STATE_GROUP_CHECKED</span> state is set to
   <span class="dom">STATE_CHECKED_UNCHECKED</span>, <span
   class="dom">STATE_CHECKED_CHECKED</span>, or <span
   class="dom">STATE_CHECKED_INDETERMINATE</span>. Progress bars, scroll bars
   and sliders (track bars) use the <span
   class="dom">STATE_GROUP_VALUE</span> metadata state to determine their
   position. The value 0 represents the lowest progress/scroll
   position/slider position, and the value 2<sup>16</sup>-1 (65535)
   represents the highest progress/scroll position/slider position.
   <!--XXX These values are arbitrary. Do we want something
    else?-->

  <h3 id="pseudo-classes"><span class="secno">2.2. </span>Pseudo-classes</h3>

  <p>The following dynamic pseudo-classes are defined in terms of state
   information that can be manipulated through the DOM.

  <dl>
   <dt>:active

   <dd>This pseudo-class matches the element that has its DYNAMIC_ACTIVE
    state set, if any.

   <dt>:hover

   <dd>This pseudo-class matches the element that has its DYNAMIC_HOVER state
    set, if any, as well as any ancestors of that element.

   <dt>:focus

   <dd>This pseudo-class matches the element which has focus, if any, as well
    as all its ancestors. See the <code class="dom">focus()</code> and <code
    class="dom">focusByMethod()</code> methods.

   <dt>:open

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their DYNAMIC_OPEN state
    set.

   <dt>:closed

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their DYNAMIC_OPEN state
    unset.

   <dt>:enabled

   <dd>This pseudo-class matches all elements that their STATE_GROUP_ENABLED
    state set to STATE_ENABLED_ENABLED, and whose ancestors (including those
    that are not focusable) all have their STATE_GROUP_ENABLED state set to
    STATE_ENABLED_ENABLED.

   <dt>:disabled

   <dd>This pseudo-class matches all elements that have either their
    STATE_GROUP_ENABLED state set to STATE_ENABLED_DISABLED or which have an
    ancestor whose STATE_GROUP_ENABLED state set to STATE_ENABLED_DISABLED
    (including ancestors that cannot be focused).

   <dt>:checked

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_CHECKED
    state set to STATE_CHECKED_CHECKED.

   <dt>:unchecked

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_CHECKED
    state set to STATE_CHECKED_UNCHECKED.

   <dt>:indeterminate

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_CHECKED
    state set to STATE_CHECKED_INDETERMINATE.

   <dt>:selected

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their
    STATE_GROUP_SELECTED state set to STATE_CHECKED_SELECTED. This
    pseudo-class is unrelated to the similarly named ::selection
    pseudo-element, which applies to the text selection.

   <dt>:unselected

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their
    STATE_GROUP_SELECTED state set to STATE_CHECKED_UNSELECTED.

   <dt>:default

   <dd>This pseudo-class matches elements that have their STATE_GROUP_DEFAULT
    state set to STATE_DEFAULT_DEFAULT.

   <dt>:valid

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_VALID
    state set to STATE_VALID_VALID.

   <dt>:invalid

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_VALID
    state set to STATE_VALID_INVALID.

   <dt>:required

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their
    STATE_GROUP_REQUIRED state set to STATE_REQUIRED_REQUIRED.

   <dt>:optional

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their
    STATE_GROUP_REQUIRED state set to STATE_REQUIRED_OPTONAL.

   <dt>:read-only

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_DATA
    state set to exactly STATE_DATA_READABLE. Note that this is independent
    of the actual editable state of the control as presented to the user. The
    actual state of the control is governed by the computed value of the
    <span class="property"><a href="#user-modify">'user-modify'</a></span>
    property on a per-view basis, while the :read-only pseudo-class relates
    to the intended state of the control as set by the data model or other
    script.

   <dt>:read-write

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_DATA
    state set to exactly STATE_DATA_EDITABLE. Note that this is independent
    of the actual editable state of the control as presented to the user. The
    actual state of the control is governed by the computed value of the
    <span class="property"><a href="#user-modify">'user-modify'</a></span>
    property on a per-view basis, while the :read-write pseudo-class relates
    to the intended state of the control as set by the data model or other
    script.

   <dt>:write-only

   <dd>This element matches all elements which have their STATE_GROUP_DATA
    state set to exactly STATE_DATA_WRITABLE. Note that this is independent
    of the actual editable state of the control as presented to the user. The
    actual state of the control is governed by the computed value of the
    <span class="property"><a href="#user-modify">'user-modify'</a></span>
    property on a per-view basis, while the :write-only pseudo-class relates
    to the intended state of the control as set by the data model or other
    script.</dd>
   <!--
:form(fname), taking an idref parameter, selects all form controls, groups, switches, and repeats associated with the XForms Model with an id of fname.

:repeat-cursor (modulo rename of 'cursor') selects all currently selected/active/focused repeat-items. (should this be a pseudo-class or pesudo-element?)
-->
  </dl>

  <p>See the <span>ElementUI</span> section for details explaining how to
   toggle these pseudo-classes.

  <p class="issue">When the UI module is in CR, this draft will need to be
   updated to take into account the other pseudo-classes from that module.</p>
  <!--
    <h3>Icons</h3>

    <p>The 'icon' property doesn't do anything directly. User agents
    may use its value as a symbol representing the element or page in
    question. The icon of the root element may be used to represent
    the entire document. For example, user agents often have a session
    history feature; a graphical view of the session history could use
    the 'icon' property of the root element of each document to draw a
    picture next to each entry.</p>

    <p>The icon associated with an element may also be used to select
    the icon used to provide feedback during drag-and-drop
    operations.</p>

    <p>This property is unrelated to the similarly named '::icon'
    pseudo-element.</p>
-->

  <h3 id="focus"><span class="secno">2.3. </span>Focus</h3>

  <p>In UAs that implement this module, the 'nav-index' property doesn't do
   anything directly. It is used by methods on the DocumentUI interface to
   determine the order used for sequential focus changing (what is commonly
   referred to as "tab order").<!--
    See XXX-->

  <p>The value none means that the element is not part of the normal tab
   order, regardless of the value of 'user-can-focus'. <!--XXX-->

  <p>The value 'auto' means that the UA may decide where in the tab order the
   element goes.

  <p>The directional navigational properties ('nav-up' and so forth)
   similarly work in terms of the directional focus methods.

  <h3 id="key-handling"><span class="secno">2.4. </span>Key handling</h3>

  <p>The 'key-equivalent' property doesn't do anything directly. It is used
   by in XBL as a filter for key events. <!--XXX--> The idea is that if the
   <span><a href="#window">window</a></span> receives a key event that
   matches an element's key-equivalent, that element will be sent a separate
   event. <!--(XXX cross ref; what event?)-->

  <p class="issue">A further draft will explain this in more detail.

  <h2 id="properties"><span class="secno">3. </span>Properties for selection,
   focus, and editing</h2>

  <p>Unlike the UI module properties, which apply to non-scriptable
   environments as well as dynamic, scriptable UAs, these properties control
   features that are directly related to the DOM.

  <h3 id="text-selection"><span class="secno">3.1. </span>Text Selection</h3>

  <table class="propdef" id="user-can-select0">
   <caption> <dfn id="user-can-select">'user-can-select'</dfn></caption>

    <tr>
     <td><em>Value:</em>

     <td>never | always | only-with-modifier

  </table>

  <p>A property to decide if the UA should allow inline selection. Note that
   this is a distinct concept from element selection -- an element can be
   flagged as selected independently of its contents being selected.

  <dl>
   <dt>never

   <dd>The contents of the element cannot be selected.

   <dt>always

   <dd>The contents of the element can be selected using the default
    UA-defined mechanism.

   <dt>only-with-modifier

   <dd>The contents of the element may only be selected using an alternate
    UA-defined selection mechanism.
  </dl>

  <p>For example, if by default a UA uses mouse dragging as a selection
   mechanism, then with 'user-can-select' is set to 'only-with-modifier' the
   same UA could change to mouse dragging with the shift key held down. The
   name 'only-with-modifier' is not meant to restrict the alternate
   mechanism, only to indicate that the UA should not enable the default
   selection mechanism.

  <p>When an elements' contents are selected (in part, in whole, or as part
   of a greater selection), that element contains a ::selection
   pseudo-element which applies to that selection. <!--See
    XXX.-->

  <p>User agents may treat the <span class="css">never</span> value as <span
   class="css">only-with-modifier</span> in untrusted documents, which
   typically would cover any document on the web, although the exact
   definition of 'trusted' is UA-defined and may be dependent on user
   preferences.

  <p>In this definition, the <dfn id="window">window</dfn> is a
   user-agent-defined construct, typically related to the viewport. When the
   window has focus, the user is typically able to scroll the document using
   arrow keys on a keyboard.</p>
  <!--
    <p>The property 'user-can-focus-key' applies when the focus change
    was requested via a keyboard event, and the property
    'user-can-focus-pointer' applies when the focus change was
    requested via a pointer event. When the source of the focus change
    is unknown, the 'user-can-focus-unknown' property applies. This
    happens when script changes the focus using the generic focus()
    method, e.g. in an onload handler where no particular user action
    is the source of the focus change.</p>

    <p>The property 'user-can-focus' can be used as a shorthand for setting the other three
    properties.</p>

   whether an element can <em>gain</em> focus in a particular view, not

  <dl>
   <dt>read-only

   <dd>The element should not be editable by the user (unless overriden by
    the UA, e.g. if the user invokes an "edit" mode on the document).

   <dt>all

   <dd>Any child node may be edited and the element itself may be deleted.
    This is equivalent to specifying all the other flags together.

  <p>This property is inherited, but only applies to editing the element
   itself and its immediate children. The following makes an element
   <code>foo</code> and its children all completely editable:

  <pre class="example">foo, foo * { user-modify: all; }</pre>

  <p>That would also allow the element itself to be deleted, however. In
   order to disallow that, the following rules would be used:

  <pre class="example">foo { user-modify: children; }
foo * { user-modify: all; }</pre>

  <p>The exact mechanisms used to enable editing is up to the UA. <!--The
    intent is that the behaviour of the HTML <code
    class='xml'>textarea</code> element should be covered by:</p>

<pre class="example">
textarea { white-space: XXX }
</pre>-->
   

  <h3 id="changes"><span class="secno">3.4. </span>Changes to text-transform</h3>

  <p>The <span class="property">'text-transform'</span> property is modified
   to allow a string value to be used. When a string value is specified, all
   characters in the string are replaced with this string. For example:

  <pre class="example">
input[type=password] { text-transform: '*'; }
</pre>

  <p>This would replace each character in an input field with an asterisk, as
   seen in many existing web browsers.

  <h3 id="changes0"><span class="secno">3.5. </span>Changes to position</h3>

  <p>The value <span class="css">popup</span> is added to the <span
   class="property">'position'</span> property. When this value is applied to
   an element, the following changes apply:

  <ol>
   <li>The element is taken out of flow and not shown (same as <span
    class="css">display:none</span>).

   <li>If the element's <span class="property">'overflow'</span> property has
    a specified value of <span class="css">visible</span> then the computed
    value becomes <span class="css">hidden</span>. Other values stay
    unaffected.
  </ol>

  <p>The ElementUI interface can then be used to actually trigger the popup.</p>
  <!--    <h3>Changes to overflow</h3>

    <p>XXX this may be handled by the text module XXX</p>

    <p>The values <span class="css">crop-start</span>, <span
    class="css">crop-end</span> and <span
    class="css">crop-middle</span> are added to the <span
    class="property">'overflow'</span> property. When these value are
    applied to an element, the overflow behaviour is the same as for
    <span class="css">hidden</span>, except that for <span
    class="css">crop-start</span> (respectively <span
    class="css">crop-end</span>, <span class="css">crop-middle</span>)
    the text is XXX (respectively YYY, ZZZ).</p>

    <p>For example, the following fragment:</p>

<pre class="example">

div1 { display: block; border: solid; overflow: crop-start; height: 2em; width: 2em; }
div2 { display: block; border: solid; height: 4em; width: 10em; }
div3 { display: block; border: solid; height: 1em; width: 3em; }

&lt;div1&gt;
  &lt;div2&gt;
    &lt;html:a href="../"&gt;&lt;html:img src="foo" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/html:a&gt;
    Foo.
    &lt;div3&gt;
    &lt;/div3&gt;    
  &lt;/div2&gt;
&lt;/div1&gt;

      prevent the popup from showing), second, the popup is aligned
      (potentially triggering a popupPositioning event), and finally a

         <dd>The element that the popup will be positioned relative to (it
          may itself be part of a popup, for example this is the case for
          cascading menus). If the <code class="dom">target</code> is <code
          class="dom">null</code>, then the point representing the (last
          known) position of the pointing device is used instead. If the
          <code class="dom">target</code> element is not visible, or if there
          is it is <code class="dom">null</code> but there is no pointing
          device, then the viewport is used instead. If the viewport is not
          visible, then the whole screen is used. This ensures that the popup
          will appear, regardless of how it was triggered.

         <dt><code class="parameter-name">anchor</code> of type <code
          class="dom">Element</code>

         <dd>The element to position relative to the target. This must be
          either the popup itself, or one of the popup's descendants
          (excluding anonymous nodes that are not in the default view). If
          <code class="dom">null</code> is used, then that implies the
          element. If the <code class="dom">anchor</code> has no defined
          position (which can happen if is hidden using CSS for example) then
          its closest ancestor which will have a position when the popup is

   <dt>Defined Constants For Popups

   <dd> The first eight of these constants use a consistent naming scheme
    based on the writing-mode independent "BASE" system (Before After Start
    End, which map, in a left-to-right top-to-bottom writing mode such as
    English, to the Top Bottom Left and Right sides respectively). The first
    word represents the side of the target which should be adjacent to the
    opposite side of the anchor, and the second word represents the sides of
    the target and anchor which should be aligned so as to be parallel to
    each other.

       class="dom">target</code> is <code class="dom">null</code> and there
       is a pointing device, then the last known position of the pointer is
       used as the target in the cases above. So for example, if <code
       class="dom">alignment</code> is set to <code
       class="dom">BEFORE_START</code> or <code class="dom">END_AFTER</code>,
       then the before/start corner of the popup is positioned at the
       pointer.</p>

      <p>When the target is a point and not a region, the following constants
       become equivalent:</p>

      <ul>
       <li>BEFORE_START and END_AFTER

       <li>BEFORE_END and START_AFTER

       <li>AFTER_START, END_BEFORE, OVERLAP and AFTER_POINTER

       <li>AFTER_END and START_BEFORE
      </ul>

      <p>If the popup is smaller than the screen, then the popup
       <em>must</em> appear completely on the screen. If, after aligning the
       popup as specified by the arguments to the showPopup method, the popup
       would overflow the screen, then the following algorithm should be
       used. The algorithm should be followed step by step until the popup
       fits on the screen.</p>

      <ol>
       <li>If the popup is wider (taller) than the screen, then its outer
        margin width (height) should be set to the width (height) of the
        screen (the <code class="property">'overflow'</code> property
        applies).

       <li>If the alignment is <code class="dom">OVERLAP</code> and the
        anchor is not the popup element itself, then position the anchor as
        required, then shift the popup such that it touches the sides of the
        screen where the anchor overflows the screen (if that is in only one
        direction, the other axis therefore remains unaffected), and apply
        the <code class="property">'overflow'</code> property at that scroll
        position.

       <li>Otherwise, some as-yet-undecided algorithm is used to try each
        alignment value in turn, and if no possibility is found, then the
        popup menu is positioned on the side that had the most room, and then
        the dimensions of the popup are changed so that (from drop downs) it
        touches the relevant side of the screen or (for side opening popups)
        it is moved so that it touches one of the sides.</li>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_ENABLED_ENABLED</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to enable and disable user interface
      elements. Every element is either STATE_ENABLED_ENABLED or
      STATE_ENABLED_DISABLED. See the :enabled and :disabled pseudo-classes.
      Elements all initially start with their STATE_GROUP_ENABLED state set

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_DEFAULT_NORMAL</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_DEFAULT_DEFAULT</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to toggle the default element of a
      document. Only one element per document may be the default at any one
      time. Setting an element to STATE_DEFAULT_DEFAULT automatically resets
      any other element to the STATE_DEFAULT_NORMAL state. See the :default
      pseudo-class. Elements all initially start with their
      STATE_GROUP_DEFAULT state set to STATE_DEFAULT_NORMAL.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_GROUP_CHECKED</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_CHECKED_CHECKED</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_CHECKED_INDETERMINATE</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to toggle the value of check box and radio
      button interface elements. Every element has one of these values. See
      the :checked, :unchecked and :indeterminate pseudo-classes. Elements
      all initially start with their STATE_GROUP_CHECKED state set to
      STATE_CHECKED_UNCHECKED.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_SELECTED_UNSELECTED</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_SELECTED_SELECTED</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to determine the selection state of entire
      elements. (Note: This is distinct from text selection and focus.) Every
      element is either STATE_SELECTED_SELECTED or STATE_SELECTED_UNSELECTED.
      See the :selected and :unselected pseudo-classes. Elements all
      initially start with their STATE_GROUP_SELECTED state set to
      STATE_SELECTED_UNSELECTED.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_VALID_INVALID</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_VALID_VALID</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to determine the validity state of entire
      elements. For example, the XForms data model can place constraints on
      the possible values of controls in a form. Every element is either
      STATE_VALID_VALID or STATE_VALID_INVALID. See the :valid and :invalid
      pseudo-classes. Elements all initially start with their
      STATE_GROUP_VALID state set to STATE_VALID_VALID.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_REQUIRED_OPTIONAL</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_REQUIRED_REQUIRED</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to determine whether entire elements are
      considered optional or required. For example, the XForms data model can
      require that fields be filled before allowing a form to be submitted.
      Every element is either STATE_REQUIRED_REQUIRED or
      STATE_REQUIRED_OPTIONAL. See the :required and :optional
      pseudo-classes. Elements all initially start with their
      STATE_GROUP_REQUIRED state set to STATE_REQUIRED_OPTIONAL.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_DATA_WRITABLE</code>

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_DATA_EDITABLE</code>

     <dd>These constants are used to determine the intended state of elements
      with respect to their content being edited. Note, however, that this
      state causes absolutely nothing to change with respect to elements'
      actual editing state! Typically, this state will be set by the data
      model being used, and selectors will then be used to change the value
      of the <span class="property"><a
      href="#user-modify">'user-modify'</a></span> property of a
      pseudo-element. Every element is in a logical bitwise addition of zero,
      one, or both of STATE_DATA_READABLE and STATE_DATA_WRITABLE. Two
      additional constants are provided for convenience: STATE_DATA_EDITABLE
      (both values set) and STATE_DATA_INACCESSIBLE (neither value set). See
      the :read-only, :write-only and :read-write pseudo-classes. Elements
      all initially start with their STATE_GROUP_DATA state set to
      STATE_DATA_READABLE.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">STATE_GROUP_VALUE</code>

     <dd>This constant is used to access the generic integer value of user
      interface elements. Every element has such a value, although it is only
      typically used by scroll bars, track bars and progress bars. Elements
      all initially start with their STATE_GROUP_VALUE state set to zero.

   <dt>Defined Constants For Dynamic State

   <dd>
    <dl>
     <dt><code class="constant-name">DYNAMIC_ACTIVE</code>

     <dd>This constant is used to toggle the active state of elements. Only
      one element per view may be active at any one time. Setting an element
      to active automatically resets any other active element to its
      non-active state. See the :active pseudo-class.

     <dt><code class="constant-name">DYNAMIC_HOVER</code>

     <dd>This constant is used to toggle the hover state of elements. Only
      one element per view may be in the hover state at any one time. Setting
      an element's hover state to true automatically resets any other
      element's hover state. See the :hover pseudo-class. User agents may, in
      addition to changes triggered using the setDynamicState() method,
      automatically set this state on elements in response to user events
      (such as moving the mouse).

     <dt><code class="constant-name">DYNAMIC_OPEN</code>

     <dd>This constant is used to toggle the open/closed state of elements.
      Every element has an open/closed state for each view. Toggling the
      open/closed state does not affect other elements or other views. (Note:
      At the moment there is no way to change the open/closed state of
      elements in any view other than the default view.) See the :open and
      :closed pseudo-classes.

            the element and compares each binding's URI with the parameter passed. 
            This can be used to check if an element has been bound to a particular 
            binding in in order to ensure that the expected methods and properties
            are available. For example widgets may walk up their ancestors looking for an
            element that has been bound to the form-container binding in order to locate
            their scope (so that radio buttons may properly be mutually exclusive, or so
            that a submit button can properly submit a form).

  <p>This section will define some aspects of the DOM Level 0 "window"
   interface. In particular, window.open (with all its flags), resizing,
   possibly window.location and other features.

  <p>A great emphasis should be placed here on backwards compatibility. Only
   the parts that are needed for UI should be defined here.</p>
  <!--
    <p>XXX Something about the DOM Implementation bootstrapping a
