   specification &gt;</a></nav><h3 id="scope"><span class="secno">1.1. </span>Scope</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  </p><p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup
   language and associated semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring
   accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents to dynamic
   applications.

  </p><p>The scope of this specification does not include addressing presentation
   concerns (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included
   at the end of this specification).

  </p><p>The scope of this specification does not include documenting every HTML
   or DOM feature supported by Web browsers. Browsers support many features
   that are considered to be very bad for accessibility or that are otherwise
   inappropriate. For example, the <code>blink</code> element is clearly
   presentational and authors wishing to cause text to blink should instead
   use CSS.

  </p><p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating
   system. In particular, hardware configuration software, image manipulation
   tools, and applications that users would be expected to use with high-end
   workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of applications,
   this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be
   expected to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from
   disparate locations, with low CPU requirements. For instance online
   purchasing systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer
   online games), public telephone books or address books, communications
   software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software),
   document editing software, etc.

  </p><p>For sophisticated cross-platform applications, there already exist
   several proprietary solutions (such as Mozilla's XUL and Macromedia's
   Flash). These solutions are evolving faster than any standards process
   could follow, and the requirements are evolving even faster. These systems
   are also significantly more complicated to specify, and are orders of
   magnitude more difficult to achieve interoperability with, than the
   solutions described in this document. Platform-specific solutions for such
   sophisticated applications (for example the MacOS X Core APIs) are even
   further ahead.

  </p><h4 id="relationship"><span class="secno">1.1.1. </span>Relationship to HTML
   4.01, XHTML 1.1, DOM2 HTML</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  </p><p>This specification represents a new version of HTML4 and XHTML1, along
   with a new version of the associated DOM2 HTML API. Migration from HTML4
   or XHTML1 to the format and APIs described in this specification should in
   most cases be straightforward, as care has been taken to ensure that
   backwards-compatibility is retained.</p>
  <!-- XXX refs -->

  <p>This specification will eventually supplant Web Forms 2.0 as well. <a href="#refsWF2">[WF2]</a>

  </p><h4 id="relationship0"><span class="secno">1.1.2. </span>Relationship to XHTML2</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  </p><p>XHTML2 <a href="#refsXHTML2">[XHTML2]</a> defines a new HTML vocabulary
   with better features for hyperlinks, multimedia content, annotating
   document edits, rich metadata, declarative interactive forms, and
   describing the semantics of human literary works such as poems and
   scientific papers.

  </p><p>However, it lacks elements to express the semantics of many of the
   non-document types of content often seen on the Web. For instance, forum
   sites, auction sites, search engines, online shops, and the like, do not
   fit the document metaphor well, and are not covered by XHTML2.

  </p><p><em>This</em> specification aims to extend HTML so that it is also
   suitable in these contexts.

  </p><p>XHTML2 and this specification use different namespaces and therefore can
   both be implemented in the same XML processor.

  </p><h4 id="relationship1"><span class="secno">1.1.3. </span>Relationship to XUL,
   Flash, Silverlight, and other proprietary UI languages</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  </p><p>This specification is independent of the various proprietary UI
   languages that various vendors provide. As an open, vender-neutral
   language, HTML provides for a solution to the same problems without the
   risk of vendor lock-in.
