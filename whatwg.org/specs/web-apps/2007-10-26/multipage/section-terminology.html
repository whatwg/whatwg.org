Conformance requirements</a> – <a href="index.html#contents">Table of contents</a> – <a href="section-dom.html#nav-bar">2. The Document Object Model &gt;</a></nav><h3 id="terminology"><span class="secno">1.4. </span>Terminology</h3>

  <p>This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and DOM
   attributes, often in the same context. When it is not clear which is being
   referred to, they are referred to as <dfn id="content">content
   attributes</dfn> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn id="dom-attributes">DOM attributes</dfn> for those from the DOM. Similarly,
   the term &quot;properties&quot; is used for both ECMAScript object properties and
   CSS properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified as object
   properties and CSS properties respectively.

  </p><p id="html-namespace">To ease migration from HTML to XHTML, UAs conforming
   to this specification will place elements in HTML in the
   <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, at least for the
   purposes of the DOM and CSS. The term &quot;<dfn id="elements1">elements in the
   HTML namespace</dfn>&quot;, or &quot;<dfn id="html-elements">HTML elements</dfn>&quot; for
   short, when used in this specification, thus refers to both HTML and XHTML
   elements.

  </p><p>Unless otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this
   specification are in the <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>
   namespace, and all attributes defined or mentioned in this specification
   have no namespace (they are in the per-element partition).

  </p><p>The term <a href="section-documents.html#html-">HTML documents</a> is sometimes used in
   contrast with <a href="section-documents.html#xml-documents">XML documents</a> to mean
   specifically documents that were parsed using an <a href="section-parsing.html#html-0">HTML
   parser</a> (as opposed to using an XML parser or created purely through
   the DOM).

  </p><p>Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies to HTML
   or XHTML, it also includes the other. When a feature specifically only
   applies to one of the two languages, it is called out by explicitly
   stating that it does not apply to the other format, as in &quot;for HTML, ...
   (this does not apply to XHTML)&quot;.

  </p><p>This specification uses the term <em>document</em> to refer to any use
   of HTML, ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports
   with rich multimedia, as well as to fully-fledged interactive
   applications.

  </p><p>For readability, the term URI is used to refer to both ASCII URIs and
   Unicode IRIs, as those terms are defined by RFC 3986 and RFC 3987
   respectively. On the rare occasions where IRIs are not allowed but ASCII
   URIs are, this is called out explicitly. <a href="#refsRFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> <a href="#refsRFC3987">[RFC3987]</a>

  </p><p>The term <dfn id="root-element">root element</dfn>, when not qualified to
   explicitly refer to the document's root element, means the furthest
   ancestor element node of whatever node is being discussed, or the node
   itself is there is none. When the node is a part of the document, then
   that is indeed the document's root element. However, if the node is not
   currently part of the document tree, the root element will be an orphaned
   node.

  </p><p>An element is said to have been <dfn id="inserted" title="insert an
   element into a document">inserted into a document</dfn> when its <a href="#root-element">root element</a> changes and is now the document's <a href="#root-element">root element</a>.

  </p><p>The term <dfn id="tree-order">tree order</dfn> means a pre-order,
   depth-first traversal of DOM nodes involved (through the <code title="">parentNode</code>/<code title="">childNodes</code> relationship).

  </p><p>When it is stated that some element or attribute is <dfn id="ignored" title="ignore">ignored</dfn>, or treated as some other value, or handled as
   if it was something else, this refers only to the processing of the node
   after it is in the DOM. A user agent must not mutate the DOM in such
   situations.

  </p><p>When an XML name, such as an attribute or element name, is referred to
   in the form <code><var title="">prefix</var>:<var title="">localName</var></code>, as in <code>xml:id</code> or
   <code>svg:rect</code>, it refers to a name with the local name <var title="">localName</var> and the namespace given by the prefix, as defined
   by the following table:

  </p><dl>
   <dt><code title="">xml</code>

   </dt><dd><code>http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace</code>

   </dd><dt><code title="">html</code>

   </dt><dd><code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>

   </dd><dt><code title="">svg</code>

   </dt><dd><code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code>
  </dd></dl>

  <p>For simplicity, terms such as <em>shown</em>, <em>displayed</em>, and
   <em>visible</em> might sometimes be used when referring to the way a
   document is rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to imply a
   visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other media in
   equivalent ways.

  </p><p>Various DOM interfaces are defined in this specification using
   pseudo-IDL. This looks like OMG IDL but isn't. For instance, method
   overloading is used, and types from the W3C DOM specifications are used
   without qualification. Language-specific bindings for these abstract
   interface definitions must be derived in the way consistent with W3C DOM
   specifications. Some interface-specific binding information for ECMAScript
   is included in this specification.

  </p><p class="big-issue">The current situation with IDL blocks is pitiful. IDL is
   totally inadequate to properly represent what objects have to look like in
   JS; IDL can't say if a member is enumerable, what the indexing behaviour
   is, what the stringification behaviour is, what behaviour setting a member
   whose type is a particular interface should be (e.g. setting of
   document.location or element.className), what constructor an object
   implementing an interface should claim to have, how overloads work, etc. I
   think we should make the IDL blocks non-normative, and/or replace them
   with something else that is better for JS while still being clear on how
   it applies to other languages. However, we do need to have something that
   says what types the methods take as arguments, since we have to raise
   exceptions if they are wrong.

  </p><p>The construction &quot;a <code>Foo</code> object&quot;, where <code>Foo</code> is
   actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate &quot;an
   object implementing the interface <code>Foo</code>&quot;.

  </p><p>A DOM attribute is said to be <em>getting</em> when its value is being
   retrieved (e.g. by author script), and is said to be <em>setting</em> when
   a new value is assigned to it.

  </p><p>If a DOM object is said to be <dfn id="live">live</dfn>, then that means
   that any attributes returning that object must always return the same
   object (not a new object each time), and the attributes and methods on
   that object must operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of
   the data.</p>
  <!-- XXX should define "same instance of" to mean JS===. -->

  <p>The terms <em>fire</em> and <em>dispatch</em> are used interchangeably
   in the context of events, as in the DOM Events specifications. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a>

  </p><p>The term <dfn id="text-node">text node</dfn> refers to any
   <code>Text</code> node, including <code>CDATASection</code> nodes (any
   <code>Node</code> with node type 3 or 4).

  </p><p>Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical reasons,
   require the user agent to <dfn id="pause">pause</dfn> until some condition
   has been met. While a user agent is paused, it must ensure that no scripts
   execute (e.g. no event handlers, no timers, etc). User agents should
   remain responsive to user input while paused, however.

  </p><h4 id="html-vs"><span class="secno">1.4.1. </span>HTML vs XHTML</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  </p><p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents
   and applications, and some APIs for interacting with in-memory
   representations of resources that use this language.

  </p><p>The in-memory representation is known as &quot;DOM5 HTML&quot;, or &quot;the DOM&quot; for
   short.

  </p><p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit
   resources that use this abstract language, two of which are defined in
   this specification.

  </p><p>The first such concrete syntax is &quot;HTML5&quot;. This is the format
   recommended for most authors. It is compatible with all legacy Web
   browsers. If a document is transmitted with the MIME type <code title="">text/html</code>, then it will be processed as an &quot;HTML5&quot;
   document by Web browsers.

  </p><p>The second concrete syntax uses XML, and is known as &quot;XHTML5&quot;. When a
   document is transmitted with an XML MIME type, such as <code title="">application/xhtml+xml</code>, then it is processed by an XML
   processor by Web browsers, and treated as an &quot;XHTML5&quot; document. Generally
   speaking, authors are discouraged from trying to use XML on the Web,
   because XML has much stricter syntax rules than the &quot;HTML5&quot; variant
   described above, and is relatively newer and therefore less mature.

  </p><p>The &quot;DOM5 HTML&quot;, &quot;HTML5&quot;, and &quot;XHTML5&quot; representations cannot all
   represent the same content. For example, namespaces cannot be represented
   using &quot;HTML5&quot;, but they are supported in &quot;DOM5 HTML&quot; and &quot;XHTML5&quot;.
   Similarly, documents that use the <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#noscript">noscript</a></code> feature can be represented using
   &quot;HTML5&quot;, but cannot be represented with &quot;XHTML5&quot; and &quot;DOM5 HTML&quot;. Comments
   that contain the string &quot;<code title="">--&gt;</code>&quot; can be represented
   in &quot;DOM5 HTML&quot; but not in &quot;HTML5&quot; and &quot;XHTML5&quot;. And so forth.
