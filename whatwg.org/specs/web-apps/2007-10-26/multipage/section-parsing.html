  <p><em>This section only applies to user agents, data mining tools, and
   conformance checkers.</em>

  </p><p>The rules for parsing <a href="section-documents.html#xml-documents">XML documents</a> (and
   thus <a href="section-conformance.html#xhtml5">XHTML</a> documents) into DOM trees are covered by
   the XML and Namespaces in XML specifications, and are out of scope of this
   specification. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a> <a href="#refsXMLNS">[XMLNS]</a> <!-- XXX refs -->

  </p><p>For <a href="section-documents.html#html-">HTML documents</a>, user agents must use the
   parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees.
   Together, these rules define what is referred to as the <dfn id="html-0">HTML parser</dfn>.</p>
  <!-- XXX should probably remove that "must" since
  it'll be redundant with something in the navigating processing model
  eventually -->

  <div class="note">
   <p>While the HTML form of HTML5 bears a close resemblance to SGML and XML,
    it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.</p>

   <p>Some earlier versions of HTML (in particular from HTML2 to HTML4) were
    based on SGML and used SGML parsing rules. However, few (if any) web
    browsers ever implemented true SGML parsing for HTML documents; the only
    user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML application have
    historically been validators. The resulting confusion — with
    validators claiming documents to have one representation while widely
    deployed Web browsers interoperably implemented a different
    representation — has wasted decades of productivity. This version
    of HTML thus returns to a non-SGML basis.</p>

   <p>Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring pipeline are
    encouraged to use XML tools and the XML serialisation of HTML5.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents, whether
   they are syntactically valid or not. Certain points in the parsing
   algorithm are said to be <dfn id="parse0" title="parse error">parse
   errors</dfn>. The error handling for parse errors is well-defined: user
   agents must either act as described below when encountering such problems,
   or must abort processing at the first error that they encounter for which
   they do not wish to apply the rules described below.

  </p><p>Conformance checkers must report at least one parse error condition to
   the user if one or more parse error conditions exist in the document and
   must not report parse error conditions if none exist in the document.
   Conformance checkers may report more than one parse error condition if
   more than one parse error conditions exist in the document. Conformance
   checkers are not required to recover from parse errors.

  </p><p class="note">Parse errors are only errors with the <em>syntax</em> of
   HTML. In addition to checking for parse errors, conformance checkers will
   also verify that the document obeys all the other conformance requirements
   described in this specification.

  </p><h4 id="overview"><span class="secno">8.2.1. </span>Overview of the parsing
   model</h4>

  <p>The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of Unicode
   characters, which is passed through a <a href="section-tokenisation.html#tokenisation0">tokenisation</a> stage (lexical analysis) followed
   by a <a href="section-tree-construction.html#tree-construction0">tree construction</a> stage (semantic
   analysis). The output is a <code>Document</code> object.

  </p><p class="note">Implementations that <a href="section-conformance.html#non-scripted">do not support
   scripting</a> do not have to actually create a DOM <code>Document</code>
   object, but the DOM tree in such cases is still used as the model for the
   rest of the specification.

  </p><p>In the common case, the data handled by the tokenisation stage comes
   from the network, but <a href="section-dynamic.html#dynamic2" title="dynamic markup
   insertion">it can also come from script</a>, e.g. using the <code title="dom-document-write-HTML"><a href="section-dynamic.html#document.write...">document.write()</a></code> API.

  </p><p><img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" alt="">

  </p><p id="nestedParsing">There is only one set of state for the tokeniser stage
   and the tree construction stage, but the tree construction stage is
   reentrant, meaning that while the tree construction stage is handling one
   token, the tokeniser might be resumed, causing further tokens to be
   emitted and processed before the first token's processing is complete.

  </p><div class="example">
   <p>In the following example, the tree construction stage will be called
    upon to handle a &quot;p&quot; start tag token while handling the &quot;script&quot; start
    tag token:</p>

   <pre>...
&lt;script&gt;
 document.write('&lt;p&gt;');
&lt;/script&gt;
...</pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="the-input0"><span class="secno">8.2.2. </span>The <dfn id="input0">input
   stream</dfn></h4>

  <p>The stream of Unicode characters that consists the input to the
   tokenisation stage will be initially seen by the user agent as a stream of
   bytes (typically coming over the network or from the local file system).
   The bytes encode the actual characters according to a particular
   <em>character encoding</em>, which the user agent must use to decode the
   bytes into characters.

  </p><p class="note">For XML documents, the algorithm user agents must use to
   determine the character encoding is given by the XML specification. This
   section does not apply to XML documents. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a>

  </p><h5 id="determining0"><span class="secno">8.2.2.1. </span>Determining the
   character encoding</h5>

  <p>In some cases, it might be impractical to unambiguously determine the
   encoding before parsing the document. Because of this, this specification
   provides for a two-pass mechanism with an optional pre-scan.
   Implementations are allowed, as described below, to apply a simplified
   parsing algorithm to whatever bytes they have available before beginning
   to parse the document. Then, the real parser is started, using a tentative
   encoding derived from this pre-parse and other out-of-band metadata. If,
   while the document is being loaded, the user agent discovers an encoding
   declaration that conflicts with this information, then the parser can get
   reinvoked to perform a parse of the document with the real encoding.

  </p><p id="documentEncoding">User agents must use the following algorithm (the
   <dfn id="encoding">encoding sniffing algorithm</dfn>) to determine the
   character encoding to use when decoding a document in the first pass. This
   algorithm takes as input any out-of-band metadata available to the user
   agent (e.g. the <a href="section-content-type-sniffing.html#content-type8" title="Content-Type">Content-Type
   metadata</a> of the document) and all the bytes available so far, and
   returns an encoding and a <dfn id="confidence" title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</dfn>. The confidence is
   either <i>tentative</i> or <i>certain</i>. The encoding used, and whether
   the confidence in that encoding is <i>tentative</i> or <i>confident</i>,
   is <a href="section-tree-construction.html#meta-charset-during-parse">used during the parsing</a> to
   determine whether to <a href="#change">change the encoding</a>.

  </p><ol>
   <li>
    <p>If the transport layer specifies an encoding, return that encoding
     with the <a href="#confidence" title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</a> <i>certain</i>, and
     abort these steps.

   </p></li><li>
    <p>The user agent may wait for more bytes of the resource to be
     available, either in this step or at any later step in this algorithm.
     For instance, a user agent might wait 500ms or 512 bytes, whichever came
     first. In general preparsing the source to find the encoding improves
     performance, as it reduces the need to throw away the data structures
     used when parsing upon finding the encoding information. However, if the
     user agent delays too long to obtain data to determine the encoding,
     then the cost of the delay could outweigh any performance improvements
     from the preparse.

   </p></li><li>
    <p>For each of the rows in the following table, starting with the first
     one and going down, if there are as many or more bytes available than
     the number of bytes in the first column, and the first bytes of the file
     match the bytes given in the first column, then return the encoding
     given in the cell in the second column of that row, with the <a href="#confidence" title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</a>
     <i>certain</i>, and abort these steps:</p>

    </td></tr></tbody></table>

   </li><li>
    <p>Otherwise, the user agent will have to search for explicit character
     encoding information in the file itself. This should proceed as follows:
     

    </p><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer to a byte in the input
     stream, initially pointing at the first byte. If at any point during
     these substeps the user agent either runs out of bytes or decides that
     scanning further bytes would not be efficient, then skip to the next
     step of the overall character encoding detection algorithm. User agents
     may decide that scanning <em>any</em> bytes is not efficient, in which
     case these substeps are entirely skipped.</p>

    <p>Now, repeat the following &quot;two&quot; steps until the algorithm aborts
     (either because user agent aborts, as described above, or because a
     character encoding is found):</p>

    <ol>

        <p>Advance the <var title="">position</var> pointer so that it points

         that was found. (The two 0x2D bytes can be the same as the those in

    <p>For the sake of interoperability, user agents should not use a

     improve this algorithm and benefit everyone...)</p>

   </li><li>
    <p>If the user agent has information on the likely encoding for this

   </p></li><li>
    <p>The user agent may attempt to autodetect the character encoding from

  <h5 id="character0"><span class="secno">8.2.2.2. </span>Character encoding
   requirements</h5>

  <p>User agents must at a minimum support the UTF-8 and Windows-1252
   encodings, but may support more.

  </p><p class="note">It is not unusual for Web browsers to support dozens if not
   upwards of a hundred distinct character encodings.

  </p><p>User agents must support the preferred MIME name of every character
   encoding they support that has a preferred MIME name, and should support
   all the IANA-registered aliases. <a href="#refsIANACHARSET">[IANACHARSET]</a>

  </p><p>When a user agent would otherwise use the ISO-8859-1 encoding, it must
   instead use the Windows-1252 encoding. User agents must not support the
   CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and SCSU encodings. <a href="#refsCESU8">[CESU8]</a>
   <a href="#refsUTF7">[UTF7]</a> <a href="#refsBOCU1">[BOCU1]</a> <a href="#refsSCSU">[SCSU]</a>

  </p><p>Support for UTF-32 is not recommended. This encoding is rarely used, and
   frequently misimplemented.

  </p><h5 id="preprocessing"><span class="secno">8.2.2.3. </span>Preprocessing the
   input stream</h5>

  <p>Given an encoding, the bytes in the input stream must be converted to
   Unicode characters for the tokeniser, as described by the rules for that
   encoding, except that leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK characters must not
   be stripped by the encoding layer.

  </p><p>Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that could not
   be converted to Unicode characters must be converted to U+FFFD REPLACEMENT
   CHARACTER code points.

  </p><p>One leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character must be ignored if any are
   present.

  </p><p>All U+0000 NULL characters in the input must be replaced by U+FFFD
   REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs. Any occurrences of such characters is a <a href="#parse0">parse error</a>.

  </p><p>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, and U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
   characters, are treated specially. Any CR characters that are followed by
   LF characters must be removed, and any CR characters not followed by LF
   characters must be converted to LF characters. Thus, newlines in HTML DOMs
   are represented by LF characters, and there are never any CR characters in
   the input to the <a href="section-tokenisation.html#tokenisation0">tokenisation</a> stage.

  </p><p>The <dfn id="next-input">next input character</dfn> is the first character
   in the input stream that has not yet been <dfn id="consumed">consumed</dfn>.
   Initially, the <em><a href="#next-input">next input character</a></em> is
   the first character in the input.

  </p><p>The <dfn id="insertion">insertion point</dfn> is the position (just before
   a character or just before the end of the input stream) where content
   inserted using <code title="dom-document-write-HTML"><a href="section-dynamic.html#document.write...">document.write()</a></code> is actually
   inserted. The insertion point is relative to the position of the character
   immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into the input stream.
   Initially, the insertion point is uninitialised.

  </p><p>The &quot;EOF&quot; character in the tables below is a conceptual character
   representing the end of the <a href="#input0">input stream</a>. If the
   parser is a <a href="section-dynamic.html#script-created">script-created parser</a>, then the
   end of the <a href="#input0">input stream</a> is reached when an <dfn id="explicit0">explicit &quot;EOF&quot; character</dfn> (inserted by the <code title="dom-document-close"><a href="section-dynamic.html#close">document.close()</a></code>
   method) is consumed. Otherwise, the &quot;EOF&quot; character is not a real
   character in the stream, but rather the lack of any further characters.

  </p><h5 id="changing"><span class="secno">8.2.2.4. </span>Changing the encoding
   while parsing</h5>

  <p>When the parser requires the user agent to <dfn id="change">change the
   encoding</dfn>, it must run the following steps. This might happen if the
   <a href="#encoding">encoding sniffing algorithm</a> described above failed
   to find an encoding, or if it found an encoding that was not the actual
   encoding of the file.

  </p><ol>
   <li>If the new encoding is UTF-16, change it to UTF-8.

   </li><li>If the new encoding is identical or equivalent to the encoding that is
    already being used to interpret the input stream, then set the <a href="#confidence" title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</a> to
    <i>confident</i> and abort these steps. This happens when the encoding
    information found in the file matches what the <a href="#encoding">encoding sniffing algorithm</a> determined to be the
    encoding, and in the second pass through the parser if the first pass
    found that the encoding sniffing algorithm described in the earlier
    section failed to find the right encoding.

   </li><li>If all the bytes up to the last byte converted by the current decoder
    have the same Unicode interpretations in both the current encoding and
    the new encoding, and if the user agent supports changing the converter
    on the fly, then the user agent may change to the new converter for the
    encoding on the fly. Set the encoding to the new encoding, set the <a href="#confidence" title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</a> to
    <i>confident</i>, and abort these steps.

   </li><li>Otherwise, <a href="section-navigating.html#navigate">navigate</a> to the document again,
    with <a href="section-navigating.html#replacement">replacement enabled</a>, but this time skip
    the <a href="#encoding">encoding sniffing algorithm</a> and instead just
    set the encoding to the new encoding and the <a href="#confidence" title="concept-encoding-confidence">confidence</a> to <i>confident</i>.
    Whenever possible, this should be done without actually contacting the
    network layer (the bytes should be re-parsed from memory), even if, e.g.,
    the document is marked as not being cacheable.
