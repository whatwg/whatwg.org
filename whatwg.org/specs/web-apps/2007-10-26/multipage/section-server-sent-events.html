  <!-- event-source -->

  <p>This section describes a mechanism for allowing servers to dispatch DOM
   events into documents that expect it. The <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#event-source">event-source</a></code> element provides a simple
   interface to this mechanism.

  </p><h4 id="the-remoteeventtarget"><span class="secno">6.2.1. </span>The <dfn id="remoteeventtarget"><code>RemoteEventTarget</code></dfn> interface</h4>

  <p>Any object that implements the <code>EventTarget</code> interface must
   also implement the <code><a href="#remoteeventtarget0">RemoteEventTarget</a></code> interface.

  </p><pre class="idl">interface <dfn id="remoteeventtarget0">RemoteEventTarget</dfn> {
  void <a href="#addeventsource" title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-addEventSource">addEventSource</a>(in DOMString src);
  void <a href="#removeeventsource" title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-removeEventSource">removeEventSource</a>(in DOMString src);
};</pre>

  <p>When the <dfn id="addeventsource" title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-addEventSource"><code>addEventSource(<var title="">src</var>)</code></dfn> method is invoked, the user agent must
   add the URI specified in <var title="">src</var> to the <a href="#list-of3" title="concept-event-source-list">list of event sources</a>
   for that object. The same URI can be registered multiple times.

  </p><p>When the <dfn id="removeeventsource" title="dom-RemoteEventTarget-removeEventSource"><code>removeEventSource(<var title="">src</var>)</code></dfn> method is invoked, the user agent must
   remove the URI specified in <var title="">src</var> from the <a href="#list-of3" title="concept-event-source-list">list of event sources</a>
   for that object. If the same URI has been registered multiple times,
   removing it must only remove one instance of that URI for each invocation
   of the <code title="removeEventSource">removeEventSource()</code> method.

  </p><p>Relative URIs must be resolved relative to <span class="big-issue">...</span>.

  </p><h4 id="connecting"><span class="secno">6.2.2. </span>Connecting to an event
   stream</h4>

  <p>Each object implementing the <code>EventTarget</code> and <code><a href="#remoteeventtarget0">RemoteEventTarget</a></code> interfaces has a
   <dfn id="list-of3" title="concept-event-source-list">list of event
   sources</dfn> that are registered for that object.

  </p><p>When a new URI is added to this list, the user agent should, as soon as
   all currently executing scripts (if any) have finished executing, and if
   the specified URI isn't removed from the list before they do so, fetch the
   resource identified by that URI.

  </p><p>When an event source is removed from the list of event sources for an
   object, if that resource is still being fetched, then the relevant
   connection must be closed.

  </p><p>Since connections established to remote servers for such resources are
   expected to be long-lived, UAs should ensure that appropriate buffering is
   used. In particular, while line buffering may be safe if lines are defined
   to end with a single U+000A LINE FEED character, block buffering or line
   buffering with different expected line endings can cause delays in event
   dispatch.

  </p><p>In general, the semantics of the transport protocol specified by the
   URIs for the event sources must be followed, including HTTP caching rules.

  </p><p>For HTTP connections, the <code title="">Accept</code> header may be
   included; if included, it must only contain formats of event framing that
   are supported by the user agent (one of which must be
   <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code>, as described below).

  </p><p>Other formats of event framing may also be supported in addition to
   <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code>, but this specification does
   not define how they are to be parsed or processed.

  </p><p class="note">Such formats could include systems like SMS-push; for example
   servers could use <code title="">Accept</code> headers and HTTP redirects
   to an SMS-push mechanism as a kind of protocol negotiation to reduce
   network load in GSM environments.

  </p><p>User agents should use the <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code> header
   in requests to bypass any caches for requests of event sources.

  </p><p>For connections to domains other than the <a href="section-documents.html#domain0">document's
   domain</a>, the semantics of the Access-Control HTTP header must be
   followed. <a href="#refsACCESSCONTROL">[ACCESSCONTROL]</a>

  </p><p>HTTP 200 OK responses with a <a href="section-content-type-sniffing.html#content-type8">Content-Type</a>
   header specifying the type <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code>
   that are either from the <a href="section-documents.html#domain0">document's domain</a> or
   explicitly allowed by the Access-Control HTTP headers must be processed
   line by line <a href="#event-stream-interpretation">as described
   below</a>.

  </p><p>For the purposes of such successfully opened event streams only, user
   agents should ignore HTTP cache headers, and instead assume that the
   resource indicates that it does not wish to be cached.

  </p><p>If such a resource completes loading (i.e. the entire HTTP response body
   is received or the connection itself closes), the user agent should
   request the event source resource again after a delay of approximately
   five seconds.

  </p><p>HTTP 200 OK responses that have a <a href="section-content-type-sniffing.html#content-type8">Content-Type</a> other than
   <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code> (or some other supported
   type), and HTTP responses whose Access-Control headers indicate that the
   resource are not to be used, must be ignored and must prevent the user
   agent from refetching the resource for that event source.

  </p><p>HTTP 201 Created, 202 Accepted, 203 Non-Authoritative Information, and
   206 Partial Content responses must be treated like HTTP 200 OK responses
   for the purposes of reopening event source resources. They are, however,
   likely to indicate an error has occurred somewhere and may cause the user
   agent to emit a warning.

  </p><p>HTTP 204 No Content, and 205 Reset Content responses must be treated as
   if they were 200 OK responses with the right MIME type but no content, and
   should therefore cause the user agent to refetch the resource after a
   short delay.

  </p><p>HTTP 300 Multiple Choices responses should be handled automatically if
   possible (treating the responses as if they were 302 Found responses
   pointing to the appropriate resource), and otherwise must be treated as
   HTTP 404 responses.

  </p><p>HTTP 301 Moved Permanently responses must cause the user agent to
   reconnect using the new server specified URI instead of the previously
   specified URI for all subsequent requests for this event source. (It
   doesn't affect other event sources with the same URI unless they also
   receive 301 responses, and it doesn't affect future sessions, e.g. if the
   page is reloaded.)

  </p><p>HTTP 302 Found, 303 See Other, and 307 Temporary Redirect responses must
   cause the user agent to connect to the new server-specified URI, but if
   the user agent needs to again request the resource at a later point, it
   must return to the previously specified URI for this event source.

  </p><p>HTTP 304 Not Modified responses should be handled like HTTP 200 OK
   responses, with the content coming from the user agent cache. A new
   request should then be made after a short delay of approximately five
   seconds.

  </p><p>HTTP 305 Use Proxy, HTTP 401 Unauthorized, and 407 Proxy Authentication
   Required should be treated transparently as for any other subresource.

  </p><p>Any other HTTP response code not listed here should cause the user agent
   to stop trying to process this event source.</p>

  <p>DNS errors must be considered fatal, and cause the user agent to not
   open any connection for that event source.

  </p><p>For non-HTTP protocols, UAs should act in equivalent ways.

  </p><h4 id="parsing1"><span class="secno">6.2.3. </span>Parsing an event stream</h4>

  <p>This event stream format's MIME type is
   <code>application/x-dom-event-stream</code>.

  </p><p>The event stream format is (in pseudo-BNF):

  </p><pre>&lt;stream&gt;          ::= &lt;bom&gt;? &lt;event&gt;*
&lt;event&gt;           ::= [ &lt;comment&gt; | &lt;command&gt; | &lt;field&gt; ]* &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;comment&gt;         ::= ';' &lt;any-char&gt;* &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;command&gt;         ::= ':' &lt;any-char&gt;* &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;field&gt;           ::= &lt;name&gt; [ ':' &lt;space&gt;? &lt;any-char&gt;* ]? &lt;newline&gt;
&lt;name&gt;            ::= &lt;name-start-char&gt; &lt;name-char&gt;*

# characters:
&lt;bom&gt;             ::= a single U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character
&lt;space&gt;           ::= a single U+0020 SPACE character (' ')
&lt;newline&gt;         ::= a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN character
                      followed by a U+000A LINE FEED character
                      | a single U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN character
                      | a single U+000A LINE FEED character
                      | the end of the file
&lt;name-start-char&gt; ::= a single Unicode character other than
                      ':', ';', U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN and U+000A LINE FEED
&lt;name-char&gt;       ::= a single Unicode character other than
                      ':', U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN and U+000A LINE FEED
&lt;any-char&gt;        ::= a single Unicode character other than
                      U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN and U+000A LINE FEED
</pre>

  <p>Event streams in this format must always be encoded as UTF-8. Lines must
   be separated by either a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF)
   character pair, a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, or a single
   U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character. User agents must treat those three
   variants as equivalent line terminators.

  </p><p>Bytes or sequences of bytes that are not valid UTF-8 sequences must be
   interpreted as the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.

  </p><p>One leading U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK character must be ignored if any are
   present.

  </p><p>The stream must then be parsed by reading everything line by line, in
   blocks separated by blank lines. Comment lines (those starting with the
   character ';') and command lines (those starting with the character ':')
   must be ignored.

  </p><p>Command lines are reserved for future extensions.</p>
  <!--XXX Lachlan says:
    For the next version of server sent events, it might be useful if
    authors could specify the retry interval for connections.

    e.g. In cases where it is known that content is only updated at
    specified intervals (e.g. once per minute), having the browser retry
    the connection every 5 seconds and fire the event with the same
    content may be excessive.

    This could possibly be done using the :command syntax.

    e.g.
      Event: click
      :retry 60000

    The browser would then retry the connection in 60,000 milliseconds (1
    minute).
  -->

  <p>For each non-blank, non-comment, non-command line, the field name must
   first be taken. This is everything on the line up to but not including the
   first colon (':') or the line terminator, whichever comes first. Then, if
   there was a colon, the data for that line must be taken. This is
   everything after the colon, ignoring a single space after the colon if
   there is one, up to the end of the line. If there was no colon the data is
   the empty string.

  </p><div class="example">
   <p>Examples:</p>

   <pre>Field name: Field data</pre>

   <pre>This is a blank field</pre>

   <pre>1. These two lines: have the same data
2. These two lines:have the same data</pre>

   <pre>1. But these two lines:  do not
2. But these two lines: do not</pre>
  </div>

  <p>If a field name occurs multiple times in a block, the value for that
   field in that black must consist of the data parts for each of those
   lines, concatenated with U+000A LINE FEED characters between them
   (regardless of what the line terminators used in the stream actually are).

  </p><div class="example">
   <p>For example, the following block:</p>

   <pre>Test: Line 1
Foo:  Bar
Test: Line 2</pre>

   <p>...is treated as having two fields, one called <code>Test</code> with
    the value &quot;<code>Line 1\nLine 2</code>&quot; (where <code>\n</code> represents
    a newline), and one called <code>Foo</code> with the value
    &quot;<code> Bar</code>&quot; (note the leading space character).</p>
  </div>

  <p>A block thus consists of all the name-value pairs for its fields.
   Command lines have no effect on blocks and are not considered part of a
   block.

  </p><p class="note">Since any random stream of characters matches the above
   format, there is no need to define any error handling.

  </p><h4 id="event-stream-interpretation"><span class="secno">6.2.4.
   </span>Interpreting an event stream</h4>

  <p>Once the fields have been parsed, they are interpreted as follows (these
   are case-sensitive exact comparisons):

  </p><dl>
   <dt><code title="">Event</code> field

   </dt><dd>
    <p>This field gives the name of the event. For example, <code title="">load</code>, <code title="">DOMActivate</code>, <code title="">updateTicker</code>. If there is no field with this name, the
     name <code title="event-message"><a href="section-event0.html#message0">message</a></code>
     must be used.

   </p></dd><dt><code title="">Namespace</code> field

   </dt><dd>
    <p>This field gives the DOM3 namespace for the event. (For normal DOM
     events this would be null.) If it isn't specified the event namespace is
     null.

   </p></dd><dt><code title="">Class</code> field

   </dt><dd>
    <p>This field gives is the interface used for the event, for instance
     <code>Event</code>, <code>UIEvent</code>, <code>MutationEvent</code>,
     <code>KeyboardEvent</code>, etc. For compatibility with DOM3 Events, the
     values <code title="">UIEvents</code>, <code title="">MouseEvents</code>, <code title="">MutationEvents</code>, and
     <code title="">HTMLEvents</code> are valid values and must be treated
     respectively as meaning the interfaces <code>UIEvent</code>,
     <code>MouseEvent</code>, <code>MutationEvent</code>, and
     <code>Event</code>. (This value can therefore be used as the argument to
     <code title="">createEvent()</code>.)</p>

    <p>If the value is not specified but the <code title="">Namespace</code>
     is null and the <code title="">Event</code> field exactly matches one of
     the events specified by DOM3 Events in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-EventTypes-complete">section
     1.4.2 &quot;Complete list of event types&quot;</a>, then the interface used must
     default to the interface relevant for that event type. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example:</p>

     <pre>Event: click</pre>

     <p>...would cause <code title="">Class</code> to be treated as
      <code>MouseEvent</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If the <code title="">Namespace</code> is null and the <code title="">Event</code> field is <code title="event-message"><a href="section-event0.html#message0">message</a></code> (including if it was not specified
     explicitly), then the <code><a href="section-event0.html#messageevent">MessageEvent</a></code> interface must be used.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the <code>Event</code> interface must be used.</p>

    <p>It is quite possible to give the wrong class for an event. This is
     equivalent to creating an event in the DOM using the DOM Event APIs, but
     using the wrong interface for it.</p>

   </dd><dt><code title="">Bubbles</code> field

   </dt><dd>
    <p>This field specifies whether the event is to bubble. If it is
     specified and has the value <code title="">No</code>, the event must not
     bubble. If it is specified and has any other value (including <code title="">no</code> or <code title="">NO</code>) then the event must
     bubble.</p>

    <p>If it is not specified but the <code title="">Namespace</code> field
     is null and the <code title="">Event</code> field exactly matches one of
     the events specified by DOM3 Events in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-EventTypes-complete">section
     1.4.2 &quot;Complete list of event types&quot;</a>, then the event must bubble if
     the DOM3 Events spec specifies that that event bubbles, and musn't
     bubble if it specifies it does not. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example:</p>

     <pre>Event: load</pre>

     <p>...would cause <code title="">Bubbles</code> to be treated as <code title="">No</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Otherwise, the event must bubble.</p>

   </dd><dt><code title="">Cancelable</code> field

   </dt><dd>
    <p>This field specifies whether the event can have its default action
     prevented. If it is specified and has the value <code title="">No</code>, the event must not be cancelable. If it is specified
     and has any other value (including <code title="">no</code> or <code title="">NO</code>) then the event must be cancelable.</p>

    <p>If it is not specified, but the <code title="">Namespace</code> field
     is null and the <code title="">Event</code> field exactly matches one of
     the events specified by DOM3 Events in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-EventTypes-complete">section
     1.4.2 &quot;Complete list of event types&quot;</a>, then the event must be
     cancelable if the DOM3 Events specification specifies that it is, and
     must not be cancelable otherwise. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example:</p>

     <pre>Event: load</pre>

     <p>...would cause <code title="">Cancelable</code> to be treated as
      <code title="">No</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Otherwise, the event must be cancelable.</p>

   </dd><dt><code title="">Target</code> field

   </dt><dd>
    <p>This field gives the node that the event is to be dispatched on.</p>

    <p>If the object for which the event source is being processed is not a
     Node, but the <code title="">Target</code> field is nonetheless
     specified, then the event must be dropped.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, if field is specified and its value starts with a <code title="">#</code> character, then the remainder of the value represents
     an ID, and the event must be dispatched on the same node as would be
     obtained by the <code title="">getElementById()</code> method on the
     <code title="">ownerDocument</code> of the node whose event source is
     being processed.</p>

    <div class="example">
     <p>For example,</p>

     <pre>Target: #test</pre>

     <p>...would target the element with ID <code title="">test</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Otherwise, if the field is specified and its value is the literal
     string &quot;<code title="">Document</code>&quot;, then the event must be
     dispatched at the <code title="">ownerDocument</code> of the node whose
     event source is being processed.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, the field (whether specified or not) is ignored and the
     event must be dispatched at the object itself.</p>
  </dd></dl>

  <p>Other fields depend on the interface specified (or possibly implied) by
   the <code title="">Class</code> field. If the specified interface has an
   attribute that exactly matches the name of the field, and the value of the
   field can be converted (using the type conversions defined in ECMAScript)
   to the type of the attribute, then it must be used. Any attributes (other
   than the <code>Event</code> interface attributes) that do not have
   matching fields are initialised to zero, null, false, or the empty string.

  </p><div class="example">
   <p>For example:</p>

   <pre>Event: click
Class: MouseEvent
button: 2</pre>

   <p>...would result in a 'click' event using the <code>MouseEvent</code>
    interface that has <code>button</code> set to <code title="">2</code> but
    <code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, etc, set to 0, false, or null
    as appropriate.</p>
  </div>

  <p>If a field does not match any of the attributes on the event, it must be
   ignored.

  </p><div class="example">
   <p>For example:</p>

   <pre>Event: keypress
Class: MouseEvent
keyIdentifier: 0</pre>

   <p>...would result in a <code>MouseEvent</code> event with its fields all
    at their default values, with the event name being <code title="">keypress</code>. The <code title="">keyIdentifier</code> field
    would be ignored. (If the author had not included the <code title="">Class</code> field explicitly, it would have just worked, since
    the class would have defaulted as described above.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Once a blank line or the end of the file is reached, an event of the
   type and namespace given by the <code title="">Event</code> and
   <code>Namespace</code> fields respectively must be synthesized and
   dispatched to the appropriate node as described by the fields above. No
   event must be dispatched until a blank line has been received or the end
   of the file reached.

  </p><p>The event must be dispatched as if using the DOM <code title="">dispatchEvent()</code> method. Thus, if the <code title="">Event</code> field was omitted, leaving the name as the empty
   string, or if the name had invalid characters, then the dispatching of the
   event fails.

  </p><p>Events fired from event sources do not have user-agent default actions.

  </p><div class="example">
   <p>The following event stream, once followed by a blank line:</p>

   <pre>data: YHOO
data: -2
data: 10</pre>

   <p>...would cause an event <code title="event-message"><a href="section-event0.html#message0">message</a></code> with the interface <code><a href="section-event0.html#messageevent">MessageEvent</a></code> to be dispatched on the
    <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#event-source">event-source</a></code> element, which
    would then bubble up the DOM, and whose <code title="dom-MessageEvent-data"><a href="section-event0.html#data4">data</a></code> attribute
    would contain the string <code>YHOO\n-2\n10</code> (where <code>\n</code>
    again represents a newline).</p>

   <p>This could be used as follows:

   </p><pre>&lt;event-source src=&quot;http://stocks.example.com/ticker.php&quot;
              onmessage=&quot;var data = event.data.split('\n'); updateStocks(data[0], data[1], data[2]);&quot;&gt;</pre>

   <p>...where <code title="">updateStocks()</code> is a function defined as:</p>

   <pre>function updateStocks(symbol, delta, value) { ... }</pre>

   <p>...or some such.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following stream contains four blocks and therefore fires four
    events. The first block has just a comment, and will fire a <code title="event-message"><a href="section-event0.html#message0">message</a></code> event with all
    the fields set to the empty string or null. The second block has two
    fields with names &quot;load&quot; and &quot;Target&quot; respectively; since there is no
    &quot;<code title="">load</code>&quot; member on the <code><a href="section-event0.html#messageevent">MessageEvent</a></code> object that field is
    ignored, leaving the event as a second <code title="event-message"><a href="section-event0.html#message0">message</a></code> event with all the fields set to the
    empty string or null, but this time the event is targetted at an element
    with ID &quot;image1&quot;. The third block is empty (no lines between two blank
    lines), and the fourth block has only two comments, so they both yet
    again fire <code title="event-message"><a href="section-event0.html#message0">message</a></code> events with all the fields set to the
    empty string or null.</p>

   <pre>; test

load
Target: #image1


; if any more events follow this block, they will not be affected by
; the &quot;Target&quot; and &quot;load&quot; fields above.
</pre>

  <p>Legacy proxy servers are known to, in certain cases, drop HTTP
   connections after a short timeout. To protect against such proxy servers,
   authors can include a comment line (one starting with a ';' character)
   every 15 seconds or so.

  </p><p>Authors wishing to relate event source connections to each other or to
   specific documents previously served might find that relying on IP
   addresses doesn't work, as individual clients can have multiple IP
   addresses (due to having multiple proxy servers) and individual IP
   addresses can have multiple clients (due to sharing a proxy server). It is
   better to include a unique identifier in the document when it is served
   and then pass that identifier as part of the URI in the <code title="attr-event-source-src"><a href="section-scripting0.html#src11">src</a></code> attribute of
   the <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#event-source">event-source</a></code> element.

  </p><p>Implementations that support HTTP's per-server connection limitation
   might run into trouble when opening multiple pages from a site if each
   page has an <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#event-source">event-source</a></code> to the
   same domain. Authors can avoid this using the relatively complex mechanism
   of using unique domain names per connection, or by allowing the user to
   enable or disable the <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#event-source">event-source</a></code> functionality on a per-page
   basis.
