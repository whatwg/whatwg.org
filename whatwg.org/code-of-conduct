<h3 id="conduct">Conduct<a class="self-link" href="#conduct"></a></h3>

<p>Contact: the WHATWG Steering Group, via <a href="mailto:sg@whatwg.org">sg@whatwg.org</a>, or a
member of the community you feel you can trust.

<ul>
 <li><p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all,
 regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
 disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other
 similar characteristic.

 <li><p>Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.

 <li><p>Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation
 choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.

 <li><p>You shall not insult, demean, or harass anyone. We interpret the term "harassment" as
 including the definition in the
 <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of
 clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In
 particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

 <li><p>This includes private harassment. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are
 being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please let the contact know
 immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
 community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

 <li><p>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour
 is not welcome.

 <li><p>Avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a
 friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
</ul>

<h3 id="moderation">Moderation<a class="self-link" href="#moderation"></a></h3>

<p>These are the policies for upholding the WHATWG Code of Conduct:

<ul>
 <li><p>Remarks that violate the WHATWG Code of Conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive,
 or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed on IRC, but never targeting another
 user, and never in a hateful manner.)

 <li><p>Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not,
 are also not allowed.

 <li><p>If you think an action of a moderator was unjustified, please take it up with that
 moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not
 allowed.

 <li><p>Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator
 creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.
</ul>

<p>In the WHATWG community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just
aim to be technically unimpeachable; try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with
offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to
unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the
community entirely.

<p>And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive.
Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were
misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated
better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow contributors comfortable.
Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about
standards and everything that involves. You will find that people will be eager to assume good
intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.
