whatwg and w3c:
 - whatwg is working on html5 and web workers
 - html5 is being done in cooperation with the w3c's htmlwg
 - web workers is being done in cooperation with the w3c's web apps wg

community:
 - today we have 924 people on whatwg and 383 on htmlwg, both very active
 - the community is also active in #whatwg on Freenode and #html-wg on W3C's IRC network
 - we have a FAQ: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ

for html5 we have:
 - progress chart: http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html
 - issues list: http://www.whatwg.org/issues/
 - w3c also has separate bugs list: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&product=HTML+WG&component=Spec+bugs&component=Spec+proposals&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&keywords_type=allwords&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=notregexp&email1=%5Emike%40w3%5C.org%24&order=bugs.bug_severity%2Cbugs.priority
 - there are issues marked in the spec as "XXX", some in comments, some in red boxes.

html5 is depended upon by a variety of specs, including:
 - xhr2
 - widgets
 - web workers

html5 has a number of sections that are to be split out:
 - content sniffing to ietf (maybe adam barth as editor?)
 - timers to web apps (maybe wilhelm as editor?)
 - uri to ietf (maybe danc as editor?)
 - web sockets protocol to ietf, dom api to web apps (no editor)
 - want editor for default rendering section
 - want editor for obsolete apis section
 - others listed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Oct/0127.html

schedule-wise, we're roughly on track to hit this timetable:
 - Last Call Working Draft in October 2009.
 - Candidate Recommendation in 2012.

interaction with other working groups:
 - we're actively working with wai to get ARIA developed
 - we have an open issue with the svgwg regarding how to support the
   svg vocabulary in text/html; right now there's a commented out
   proposal in the source of the spec but the svgwg will contact us at
   some point regarding moving forward on this
 - the rdfa community has sent feedback that hasn't yet been processed
 - the xhtml2 wg has an outstanding action item to suggest some text
   for our "relationship with xhtml" section
 - the w3c team (specifically plh) has an action to get the spec's
   license changed to something more open to reuse and derivations,
   e.g. creative commons (deadline oct 2009)

priorities:
 - mostly driven by implementor requests
