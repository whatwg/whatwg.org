  <h2>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group Charter</h2>

  <p>Note: This document was written in 2004 and no longer represents anything like how the WHATWG operates. For a more up to date
  discussion on how the WHATWG functions today, the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> does a better job. The original charter is included below
  to provide historical context.</p>

  <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

  <p id="the-good">Software developers are increasingly using the Web
  to deploy their applications. User Agents serve as front ends for
  server-based applications, and W3C technologies &mdash; including
  HTML, CSS and DOM &mdash; are often used to build user interfaces to
  these applications. Along with ECMAScript, these technologies
  provide a foundation for Web applications.</p>

  <p id="the-bad">However, the aforementioned technologies were not
  developed with Web applications in mind, and Web applications often
  rely on unintended features not fully described by the
  specifications. The next generation of Web applications will add new
  requirements to the development environment &mdash; requirements
  these technologies are not prepared to fulfill alone. New
  technologies being developed by the W3C and IETF can contribute to
  Web applications, but these are often designed to address other
  needs and only consider Web Applications in a peripheral way.</p>

  <h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

  <p id="address">The goal of the Web Hypertext Applications
  Technology Working Group is to address the need for one coherent
  development environment for Web applications, through the creation
  of technical specifications that are intended to be implemented in
  mass-market Web browsers.</p>

  <p>The expected deliverables include:</p>

  <ul id="deliv-list">

   <li id="wf2">Web Forms 2.0: An incremental improvement of
   HTML4.01's forms.</li>

   <li id="wa1">Web Applications 1.0: Features for Application
   Development in HTML.</li>

   <li id="wc1">Web Controls 1.0: A specification describing
   mechanisms for creating new widgets that can be used with the Web
   Forms and Web Applications technologies.</li>

   <li id="cssrom">CSS Rendering Object Model: A specification for
   defining access to the CSS rendering tree so that applications can
   access, e.g., the active selection, and rendered ::before and
   ::after content.</li>

  </ul>

  <p id="other">Other deliverables may be found to be needed to cover
  other areas that Web application developers require. For instance we
  may work on specifications for new semantic elements that cover
  common scenarios such as those found in e-commerce, forums, Web
  logs, and games. The list of deliverables above is not meant to be
  exclusive.</p>

  <p id="back-compat">All specifications produced by this working
  group must take into account backwards compatibility, and clearly
  specify reasonable transition strategies for authors. They must also
  specify error handling behaviour to ensure interoperability even in
  the face of documents that do not comply with the letter of the
  specification.</p>

<!-- PROPOSED NEW TEXT

  <p id="back-compat-details">Specifically, "backwards compatibility"
  means that it must be possible to write documents and applications
  using the features described in specifications produced by this
  working group but have those documents and applications degrade
  gracefully in user agents that comply to older specifications. New
  features must either fallback onto older, less powerful but
  functionally equivalent features, or be ignored by legacy user
  agents altogether.</p>

  <p id="market-leader">In addition, it must be possible to write
  extensions to the user agent with most market share in such a way
  that pages written to use the working group's new specifications are
  able to use most of these new features in that user agent without
  requiring users to download plugins.</p>

-->

  <h3 id="process">Process</h3>

  <p id="list">Working group contributors will contribute to this
  activity through a publicly-archived and open-subscription mailing
  list. The working group members should also respond to queries from
  the public on this mailing list.</p>

  <p id="editor">Each document shall have an assigned editor. Editors
  should reflect the consensus opinion of the working group when
  writing their specifications, but it is the document editor's
  responsibility to break deadlocks when the working group cannot come
  to an agreement on an issue.</p>

  <p id="public">Specifications will be developed in public, with the
  latest version always publically available. During development, the
  working group may decide that a document has reached a stable stage
  and is in need of wider review. At this point the document will be
  archived in its current state, and a call-for-comments will be
  announced. Drafts in this stage should bear a warning informing
  readers that the specification is not considered ready for
  non-experimental implementations, and that experimental
  implementations of the draft must not be included in end-user
  products.</p>

  <p id="consensus">The working group can make a decision to publish a
  stable version of a document only if the overwhelming majority of
  the working group members agree that the document is ready.</p>

  <p id="implement">When a draft has been subjected to a
  call-for-comments in which no new and useful comments have been
  received, the working group may decide that the specification is
  ready to be implemented in Web browsers (both for desktop and
  low-end devices) and shipped to end users. At this stage, the
  document will be archived, and a call-for-implementations will be
  announced.</p>

  <p id="crec">In order for a draft to proceed past the
  call-for-implementations stage to the recommendation stage, there
  must be at least two interoperable implementations for every
  feature. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the following
  terms:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt id="feature">feature</dt>
   <dd>A section or subsection of the specification.</dd>
   <dt id="interop">interoperable</dt>
   <dd>passing the respective test cases in the test suite.</dd>
   <dt id="ua">implementation</dt>
   <dd>a user agent which:
    <ol>
     <li id="impl">implements the feature.</li>
     <li id="avail">is available (i.e. publicly downloadable or
     available through some other public point of sale mechanism).
     This is the "show me" requirement.</li>
     <li id="ship">is shipping (i.e. development, private or
     unofficial versions are insufficient).</li>
     <li id="real">is not experimental (i.e. is intended for a wide
     audience and could be used on a daily basis).</li>
    </ol>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p id="return">If implementation feedback warrants it, or if
  implementations are not found to be sufficiently interoperable,
  specifications in the call-for-implementations stage will be
  returned to the draft stage to address the issues raised and reasons
  for implementation differences.</p>
