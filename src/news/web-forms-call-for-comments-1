  <h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr> calls for comments on Web Forms 2.0 proposal</h2>

  <p><img src="/images/logo" alt="WHATWG, "><span class="date">Sunday, June 27th 2004</span></p>

  <p>Comments on the <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2004-06-27-call-for-comments/">first
  stable draft</a> of the Web Forms 2.0 specification are encouraged.</p>

  <p>The Web Forms 2.0 specification addresses requests made for new
  features to be added to the Forms features in HTML4. New features
  include new input control types for dates, times, e-mail addresses,
  and numbers; a new client-side validation model; a way to mark input
  controls as required; a repetition model; control over form
  submission so that forms can be updated instead of causing the page
  to be replaced; and more.</p>

  <p>Comments should be sent to <a
  href="http://whatwg.org/mailing-list">the WHATWG mailing
  list</a>.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
  Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
  collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
  The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
  technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
  Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a
  standards organisation. This submission would then form the basis of
  work on formally extending HTML in the standards track.</p>

  <p>For more information, visit the Web Hypertext Applications
  Technology working group Web site at <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/"><code>http://whatwg.org/</code></a>.</p>
