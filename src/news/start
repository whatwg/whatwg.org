  <h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr> open mailing list announcement</h2>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
  Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
  collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
  The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
  technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
  Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a
  standards organisation. This submission would then form the basis of
  work on formally extending HTML in the standards track.</p>

  <p>The creation of this forum follows from several months of work by
  private e-mail on specifications for such technologies. The main
  focus up to this point has been extending HTML4 Forms to support
  features requested by authors, without breaking backwards
  compatibility with existing content. This group was created to
  ensure that future development of these specifications will be
  completely open, through a publicly-archived, open mailing list.
  Working drafts of the specifications will be continuously available
  on the WHATWG Web site. As the drafts reach stable milestones, the
  group will publish snapshots for extensive review by the
  community.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>Software developers are increasingly using the Internet as a
  software platform, with Web browsers serving as front ends for
  server-based services. Existing <abbr title="World Wide Web
  Consortium">W3C</abbr> technologies &mdash; including <abbr
  title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr
  title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> and the <abbr
  title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> &mdash; are used, together
  with other technologies such as JavaScript, to build user interfaces
  for these Web-based applications.</p>

  <p>However, the aforementioned technologies were not developed with
  Web Applications in mind, and these systems often have to rely on
  poorly documented behaviors. Furthermore, the next generation of Web
  Applications will add new requirements to the development
  environment &mdash; requirements these technologies are not prepared
  to fulfill alone. The new technologies being developed by the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C</a> and <a
  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">IETF</a> can contribute to Web
  Applications, but these are often designed to address other needs
  and only consider Web Applications in a peripheral way.</p>

  <p>The Web Hypertext Applications Technology working group therefore
  intends to address the need for one coherent development environment
  for Web Applications. To this end, the working group will create
  technical specifications that are intended for implementation in
  mass-market Web browsers, in particular Safari, Mozilla, and
  Opera.</p>

  <p>Initially, the following documents will be written:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>Web Forms 2.0: An incremental improvement of HTML4.01's forms.</li>
   <li>Web Apps 1.0: Features for Application Development in HTML.</li>
   <li>Web Controls 1.0: A specification describing mechanisms for
   creating new interactive widgets.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>More specifications may be added to cover other Web Application
  requirements. For example, the working group may work on
  specifications for new semantic elements needed in common Web
  contexts such as e-commerce, forums, Web logs, and games.</p>

  <p>The working group intends to ensure that all its specifications
  address backwards compatibility concerns, clearly provide reasonable
  transition strategies for authors, and specify error handling
  behavior to ensure interoperability even in the face of documents
  that do not comply to the letter of the specifications.</p>
