  <h2><abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology">WHAT</abbr> calls for final comments on Web Forms 2.0 proposal</h2>

  <p><img src="/images/logo" alt="WHATWG, "><span class="date">Friday, January 28th 2005</span></p>

  <p>Comments on the <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/2005-01-28-call-for-comments/">third
  stable draft</a> of the Web Forms 2.0 specification are encouraged.</p>

  <p>The draft is considered reasonably stable and mature, and it is
  hoped that it will progress to a call for implementations in a few
  months. This publication should therefore be considered the last
  explicit call for comments for this draft.</p>

  <p>This third call for comments contains a number of editorial
  changes that were made based on the feedback received from the last
  call for comments. There have been no major normative changes.</p>

  <p>The Web Forms 2.0 specification addresses requests made for new
  features to be added to the Forms features in HTML4. New features
  include new input control types for dates, times, e-mail addresses,
  and numbers; a new client-side validation model; a way to mark input
  controls as required; a repetition model; control over form
  submission so that forms can be updated instead of causing the page
  to be replaced; and more.</p>

  <p>Comments should be sent to <a
  href="http://whatwg.org/mailing-list">the WHATWG mailing
  list</a>.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Applications
  Technology Working Group</a> is a loose, unofficial, and open
  collaboration of Web browser manufacturers and interested parties.
  The group aims to develop specifications based on HTML and related
  technologies to ease the deployment of interoperable Web
  Applications, with the intention of submitting the results to a
  standards organisation. This submission would then form the basis of
  work on formally extending HTML in the standards track.</p>

  Technology working group Web site at <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/"><code>http://whatwg.org/</code></a>.</p>
