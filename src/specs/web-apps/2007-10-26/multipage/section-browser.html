  <p>The <dfn id="navigator" title="dom-navigator"><code>navigator</code></dfn>
   attribute of the <code><a href="section-the-default0.html#window">Window</a></code> interface must
   return an instance of the <code><a href="#clientinformation">ClientInformation</a></code> interface, which
   represents the identity and state of the user agent (the client), and
   allows Web pages to register themselves as potential protocol and content
   handlers:

  </p><pre class="idl">interface <dfn id="clientinformation">ClientInformation</dfn> {
  readonly attribute boolean <a href="section-offline.html#navigator.online" title="dom-navigator-onLine">onLine</a>;
  void <a href="#registerprotocolhandler" title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler">registerProtocolHandler</a>(in DOMString protocol, in DOMString uri, in DOMString title);
  void <a href="#registercontenthandler" title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler">registerContentHandler</a>(in DOMString mimeType, in DOMString uri, in DOMString title);
<!-- XXX there are other attributes! -->};</pre>
  <!-- also, see window.external.AddSearchProvider() and similar DOM APIs from IE -->

  <h4 id="custom-handlers"><span class="secno">4.5.1. </span>Custom protocol and
   content handlers</h4>

  <p>The <dfn id="registerprotocolhandler" title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler"><code>registerProtocolHandler()</code></dfn>
   method allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers for
   particular protocols. For example, an online fax service could register
   itself as a handler of the <code>fax:</code> protocol (<a href="#refsRFC2806">[RFC2806]</a>), so that if the user clicks on such a
   link, he is given the opportunity to use that Web site. Analogously, the
   <dfn id="registercontenthandler" title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler"><code>registerContentHandler()</code></dfn>
   method allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers for
   content in a particular MIME type. For example, the same online fax
   service could register itself as a handler for <code>image/g3fax</code>
   files (<a href="#refsRFC1494">[RFC1494]</a>), so that if the user has no
   native application capable of handling G3 Facsimile byte streams, his Web
   browser can instead suggest he use that site to view the image.

  </p><p>User agents may, within the constraints described in this section, do
   whatever they like when the methods are called. A UA could, for instance,
   prompt the user and offer the user the opportunity to add the site to a
   shortlist of handlers, or make the handlers his default, or cancel the
   request. UAs could provide such a UI through modal UI or through a
   non-modal transient notification interface. UAs could also simply silently
   collect the information, providing it only when relevant to the user.

  </p><p>There is <a href="#sample-handler-impl">an example of how these methods
   could be presented to the user</a> below.

  </p><p>The arguments to the methods have the following meanings:

  </p><dl>
   <dt><var title="">protocol</var> (<code title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler"><a href="#registerprotocolhandler">registerProtocolHandler()</a></code>
    only)

   </dt><dd>
    <p>A scheme, such as <code>ftp</code> or <code>fax</code>. The scheme
     must be treated case-insensitively by user agents for the purposes of
     comparing with the scheme part of URIs that they consider against the
     list of registered handlers.</p>

    <p>The <var title="">protocol</var> value, if it contains a colon (as in
     &quot;<code>ftp:</code>&quot;), will never match anything, since schemes don't
     contain colons.</p>

   </dd><dt><var title="">mimeType</var> (<code title="dom-navigator-registerContentHandler"><a href="#registercontenthandler">registerContentHandler()</a></code> only)

   </dt><dd>
    <p>A MIME type, such as <code>model/vrml</code> or
     <code>text/richtext</code>. The MIME type must be treated
     case-insensitively by user agents for the purposes of comparing with
     MIME types of documents that they consider against the list of
     registered handlers.</p>

    <p>User agents must compare the given values only to the MIME
     type/subtype parts of content types, not to the complete type including
     parameters. Thus, if <var title="">mimeType</var> values passed to this
     method include characters such as commas or whitespace, or include MIME
     parameters, then the handler being registered will never be used.</p>

   </dd><dt><var title="">uri</var>

   </dt><dd>
    <p>The URI of the page that will handle the requests. When the user agent
     uses this URI, it must replace the first occurrence of the exact literal
     string &quot;<code>%s</code>&quot; with an escaped version of the URI of the
     content in question (as defined below), and then fetch the resulting URI
     using the GET method (or equivalent for non-HTTP URIs).</p>

    <p>To get the escaped version of the URI, first, the domain part of the
     URI (if any) must be converted to its punycode representation, and then,
     every character in the URI that is not in the ranges given in the next
     paragraph must be replaced by its UTF-8 byte representation, each byte
     being represented by a U+0025 (%) character and two digits in the range
     U+0030 (0) to U+0039 (9) and U+0041 (A) to U+0046 (F) giving the
     hexadecimal representation of the byte.</p>

    <p>The ranges of characters that must not be escaped are: U+002D (-),
     U+002E (.), U+0030 (0) to U+0039 (9), U+0041 (A) to U+005A (Z), U+005F
     (_), U+0061 (a) to U+007A (z), and U+007E (~).</p>
    <!-- XXX move that to a common algorithms section if any other
    part of the spec needs it -->
    
    <div class="example">
     <p>If the user had visited a site that made the following call:</p>

     <pre>navigator.registerContentHandler('application/x-soup', 'http://example.com/soup?url=%s', 'SoupWeb™')</pre>

     <p>...and then clicked on a link such as:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.net/chickenkïwi.soup&quot;&gt;Download our Chicken Kiwi soup!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

     <p>...then, assuming this <code>chickenkïwi.soup</code> file was
      served with the MIME type <code>application/x-soup</code>, the UA might
      navigate to the following URI:</p>

     <pre>http://example.com/soup?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.net%2Fchickenk%C3%AFwi.soup</pre>

     <p>This site could then fetch the <code>chickenkïwi.soup</code>
      file and do whatever it is that it does with soup (synthesise it and
      ship it to the user, or whatever).</p>
    </div>

   </dd><dt><var title="">title</var>

   </dt><dd>
    <p>A descriptive title of the handler, which the UA might use to remind
     the user what the site in question is.</p>
  </dd></dl>

  <p>User agents should raise <a href="section-scripting.html#security8" title="security
   exception">security exceptions</a> if the methods are called with <var title="">protocol</var> or <var title="">mimeType</var> values that the UA
   deems to be &quot;privileged&quot;. For example, a site attempting to register a
   handler for <code>http</code> URIs or <code>text/html</code> content in a
   Web browser would likely cause an exception to be raised.

  </p><p>User agents must raise a <code>SYNTAX_ERR</code> exception if the <var title="">uri</var> argument passed to one of these methods does not
   contain the exact literal string &quot;<code>%s</code>&quot;.

  </p><p>User agents must not raise any other exceptions (other than
   binding-specific exceptions, such as for an incorrect number of arguments
   in an ECMAScript implementation).

  </p><p>This section does not define how the pages registered by these methods
   are used, beyond the requirements on how to process the <var title="">uri</var> value (see above). To some extent, the <a href="section-navigating.html#navigate" title="navigate">processing model for navigating across
   documents</a> defines some cases where these methods are relevant, but in
   general UAs may use this information wherever they would otherwise
   consider handing content to native plugins or helper applications.

  </p><p>UAs must not use registered content handlers to handle content that was
   returned as part of a non-GET transaction (or rather, as part of any
   non-idempotent transaction), as the remote site would not be able to fetch
   the same data.

  </p><h5 id="security3"><span class="secno">4.5.1.1. </span>Security and privacy</h5>

  <p>These mechanisms can introduce a number of concerns, in particular
   privacy concerns.

  </p><p><strong>Hijacking all Web usage.</strong> User agents should not allow
   protocols that are key to its normal operation, such as <code>http</code>
   or <code>https</code>, to be rerouted through third-party sites. This
   would allow a user's activities to be trivially tracked, and would allow
   user information, even in secure connections, to be collected.

  </p><p><strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> It is strongly recommended that
   user agents do not automatically change any defaults, as this could lead
   the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is not expecting. New
   handlers registering themselves should never automatically cause those
   sites to be used.

  </p><p><strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should consider the
   possibility that a site will attempt to register a large number of
   handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g. by redirecting through a
   series of pages each on a different domain, and each registering a handler
   for <code>video/mpeg</code> — analogous practices abusing other Web
   browser features have been used by pornography Web sites for many years).
   User agents should gracefully handle such hostile attempts, protecting the
   user.

  </p><p><strong>Misleading titles.</strong> User agents should not rely wholy on
   the <var title="">title</var> argument to the methods when presenting the
   registered handlers to the user, since sites could easily lie. For
   example, a site <code>hostile.example.net</code> could claim that it was
   registering the &quot;Cuddly Bear Happy Content Handler&quot;. User agents should
   therefore use the handler's domain in any UI along with any title.

  </p><p><strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should protect
   against typical attacks against strings embedded in their interface, for
   example ensuring that markup or escape characters in such strings are not
   executed, that null bytes are properly handled, that over-long strings do
   not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and so forth.

  </p><p><strong>Leaking Intranet URIs.</strong> The mechanism described in this
   section can result in secret Intranet URIs being leaked, in the following
   manner:

  </p><ol>
   <li>The user registers a third-party content handler as the default
    handler for a content type.

   </li><li>The user then browses his corporate Intranet site and accesses a
    document that uses that content type.

   </li><li>The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third party the
    URI to the Intranet content.
  </li></ol>

  <p>No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but the URIs
   themselves could contain confidential information. For example, the URI
   could be
   <code>https://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/samples.egf</code>,
   which might tell the third party that Example Corporation is intending to
   merge with Samples LLC. Implementors might wish to consider allowing
   administrators to disable this feature for certain subdomains, content
   types, or protocols.

  </p><p><strong>Leaking secure URIs.</strong> User agents should not send HTTPS
   URIs to third-party sites registered as content handlers, in the same way
   that user agents do not send <code>Referer</code> headers from secure
   sites to third-party sites.

  </p><p><strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send
   username or password information in the URIs that are escaped and included
   sent to the handler sites. User agents may even avoid attempting to pass
   to Web-based handlers the URIs of resources that are known to require
   authentication to access, as such sites would be unable to access the
   resources in question without prompting the user for credentials
   themselves (a practice that would require the user to know whether to
   trust the third-party handler, a decision many users are unable to make or
   even understand).

   work as follows.

  </p><p>The <code title="dom-navigator-registerProtocolHandler"><a href="#registerprotocolhandler">registerProtocolHandler()</a></code>
   method could display a modal dialog box:
