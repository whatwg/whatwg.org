  <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
   non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

  </p><p>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in the

  <!-- XXX but they should be marked up -->

  <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   &quot;strip any leading space characters&quot; or &quot;return false and abort these
   steps&quot;) are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word (&quot;must&quot;,
   &quot;should&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

  </p><p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for user agents
   (relevant to implementors) and documents (relevant to authors and
   authoring tool implementors).

  </p><p class="note">There is no implied relationship between document conformance
   requirements and implementation conformance requirements. User agents are
   not free to handle non-conformant documents as they please; the processing
   model described in this specification applies to implementations
   regardless of the conformity of the input documents.</p>
  <!--XXX quite possible that
  this is stated twice. check for whether this is a dupe. -->

  <p>User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with different
   conformance requirements.

  </p><dl>
   <dt id="interactive">Web browsers and other interactive user agents

   </dt><dd>
    <p>Web browsers that support <a href="#xhtml5">XHTML</a> must process
     elements and attributes from the <a href="section-namespaces.html#html-namespace0">HTML
     namespace</a> found in <a href="section-documents.html#xml-documents">XML documents</a> as
     described in this specification, so that users can interact with them,
     unless the semantics of those elements have been overridden by other
     specifications.</p>

    <p class="example">A conforming XHTML processor would, upon finding an
     XHTML <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#script0">script</a></code> element in an XML
     document, execute the script contained in that element. However, if the
     element is found within an XSLT transformation sheet (assuming the UA
     also supports XSLT), then the processor would instead treat the <code><a href="section-scripting0.html#script0">script</a></code> element as an opaque element that
     forms part of the transform.</p>

    <p>Web browsers that support <a href="#html5" title="HTML5">HTML</a> must
     process documents labelled as <code>text/html</code> as described in
     this specification, so that users can interact with them.</p>

   </dd><dt id="non-interactive">Non-interactive presentation user agents

   </dt><dd>
    <p>User agents that process HTML and XHTML documents purely to render
     non-interactive versions of them must comply to the same conformance
     criteria as Web browsers, except that they are exempt from requirements
     regarding user interaction.</p>

    <p class="note">Typical examples of non-interactive presentation user
     agents are printers (static UAs) and overhead displays (dynamic UAs). It
     is expected that most static non-interactive presentation user agents
     will also opt to <a href="#non-scripted">lack scripting support</a>.</p>

    <p class="example">A non-interactive but dynamic presentation UA would
     still execute scripts, allowing forms to be dynamically submitted, and
     so forth. However, since the concept of &quot;focus&quot; is irrelevant when the
     user cannot interact with the document, the UA would not need to support
     any of the focus-related DOM APIs.</p>

   </dd><dt><dfn id="non-scripted">User agents with no scripting support</dfn>

   </dt><dd>
    <p>Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have their
     scripting features <a href="section-scripting.html#scripting1" title="scripting is
     disabled">disabled</a>) are exempt from supporting the events and DOM
     interfaces mentioned in this specification. For the parts of this
     specification that are defined in terms of an events model or in terms
     of the DOM, such user agents must still act as if events and the DOM
     were supported.</p>

    <p class="note">Scripting can form an integral part of an application. Web
     browsers that do not support scripting, or that have scripting disabled,
     might be unable to fully convey the author's intent.</p>

   </dd><dt>Conformance checkers

   </dt><dd id="conformance-checkers">
    <p>Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to the
     applicable conformance criteria described in this specification.
     Conformance checkers are exempt from detecting errors that require
     interpretation of the author's intent (for example, while a document is
     non-conforming if the content of a <code><a href="section-sections.html#blockquote">blockquote</a></code> element is not a quote,
     conformance checkers do not have to check that <code><a href="section-sections.html#blockquote">blockquote</a></code> elements only contain quoted
     material).</p>

    <p>Conformance checkers must check that the input document conforms when
     <a href="section-scripting.html#scripting1">scripting is disabled</a>, and should also check
     that the input document conforms when <a href="section-scripting.html#scripting2">scripting is
     enabled</a>. (This is only a &quot;SHOULD&quot; and not a &quot;MUST&quot; requirement
     because it has been proven to be impossible. <a href="#refsHALTINGPROBLEM">[HALTINGPROBLEM]</a>)</p>

    -->
    
    <p>The term &quot;HTML5 validator&quot; can be used to refer to a conformance
     checker that itself conforms to the applicable requirements of this
     specification.</p>

    <div class="note">
     <p>XML DTDs cannot express all the conformance requirements of this
      specification. Therefore, a validating XML processor and a DTD cannot
      constitute a conformance checker. Also, since neither of the two
      authoring formats defined in this specification are applications of
      SGML, a validating SGML system cannot constitute a conformance checker
      either.</p>

     <p>To put it another way, there are three types of conformance criteria:</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD.

      </li><li>Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be
       checked by a machine.

      </li><li>Criteria that can only be checked by a human.
     </li></ol>

     <p>A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple
      DTD-based validator only checks for the first class of errors and is
      therefore not a conforming conformance checker according to this
      specification.</p>
    </div>

   </dd><dt>Data mining tools

   </dt><dd id="data-mining">
    <p>Applications and tools that process HTML and XHTML documents for
     reasons other than to either render the documents or check them for
     conformance should act in accordance to the semantics of the documents
     that they process.</p>

    <p class="example">A tool that generates <span title="sections and
     headings">document outlines</span> but increases the nesting level for
     each paragraph and does not increase the nesting level for each section
     would not be conforming.</p>

   </dd><dt id="editors">Authoring tools and markup generators

   </dt><dd>
    <p>Authoring tools and markup generators must generate conforming
     documents. Conformance criteria that apply to authors also apply to
     authoring tools, where appropriate.</p>

    <p>Authoring tools are exempt from the strict requirements of using
     elements only for their specified purpose, but only to the extent that
     authoring tools are not yet able to determine author intent.</p>

    <p class="example">For example, it is not conforming to use an <code><a href="section-sections.html#address">address</a></code> element for arbitrary contact
     information; that element can only be used for marking up contact
     information for the author of the document or section. However, since an
     authoring tools is likely unable to determine the difference, an
     authoring tool is exempt from that requirement.</p>

    <p class="note">In terms of conformance checking, an editor is therefore
     required to output documents that conform to the same extent that a
     conformance checker will verify.</p>

    <p>When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming document, it
     may preserve the conformance errors in sections of the document that
     were not edited during the editing session (i.e. an editing tool is
     allowed to round-trip errorneous content). However, an authoring tool
     must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so
     preserved.</p>

    <p>Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties: tools
     that work from structure or semantic data, and tools that work on a
     What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get media-specific editing basis (WYSIWYG).</p>

    <p>The former is the preferred mechanism for tools that author HTML,
     since the structure in the source information can be used to make
     informed choices regarding which HTML elements and attributes are most
     appropriate.</p>

    <p>However, WYSIWYG tools are legitimate, and this specification <a href="section-wysiwyg.html#wysiwyg1" title="WYSIWYG editors">makes certain concessions to
     WYSIWYG editors</a>.</p>

    <p>All authoring tools, whether WYSIWYG or not, should make a best effort
     attempt at enabling users to create well-structured, semantically rich,
     media-independent content.</p>
  </dd></dl>

  <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on elements,
   attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements fall into two
   categories; those describing content model restrictions, and those
   describing implementation behaviour. The former category of requirements
   are requirements on documents and authoring tools. The second category are
   requirements on user agents.

  </p><p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
   implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
   particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to
   be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)

  </p><p id="hardwareLimitations">User agents may impose implementation-specific
   limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of
   service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around
   platform-specific limitations.

  </p><p>For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications, this
   specification describes two authoring formats: one based on XML (referred
   to as <dfn id="xhtml5" title="XHTML">XHTML5</dfn>), and one using a <a href="section-parsing.html#parsing">custom format</a> inspired by SGML (referred to as <dfn id="html5">HTML5</dfn>). Implementations may support only one of these two
   formats, although supporting both is encouraged.

  </p><p id="authors-using-xhtml"><a href="#xhtml5">XHTML</a> documents (<a href="section-documents.html#xml-documents">XML documents</a> using elements from the <a href="section-namespaces.html#html-namespace0">HTML namespace</a>) that use the new features
   described in this specification and that are served over the wire (e.g. by
   HTTP) must be sent using an XML MIME type such as
   <code>application/xml</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> and
   must not be served as <code>text/html</code>. <a href="#refsRFC3023">[RFC3023]</a>

  </p><p>Such XML documents may contain a <code>DOCTYPE</code> if desired, but
   this is not required to conform to this specification.

  </p><p class="note">According to the XML specification, XML processors are not
   guaranteed to process the external DTD subset referenced in the DOCTYPE.
   This means, for example, that using entities for characters in XHTML
   documents is unsafe (except for &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, &amp;amp;, &amp;quot;
   and &amp;apos;). For interoperability, authors are advised to avoid
   optional features of XML.

  </p><p id="authors-using-html"><a href="#html5" title="HTML5">HTML documents</a>,

  <!--
  XXX update RFC 2854 -->

  <p id="entity-references">The language in this specification assumes that the
   user agent expands all entity references, and therefore does not include
   entity reference nodes in the DOM. If user agents do include entity
   reference nodes in the DOM, then user agents must handle them as if they
   were fully expanded when implementing this specification. For example, if
   a requirement talks about an element's child text nodes, then any text
   nodes that are children of an entity reference that is a child of that
   element would be used as well.</p>

  <p>This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.

  </p><dl>
   <dt>XML

   </dt><dd>
    <p>Implementations that support XHTML5 must support some version of XML,
     as well as its corresponding namespaces specification, because XHTML5
     uses an XML serialisation with namespaces. <a href="#refsXML">[XML]</a>
     <a href="#refsXMLNAMES">[XMLNAMES]</a></p>

   </dd><dt>XML Base

   </dt><dd>
    <p id="xmlBase">User agents must follow the rules given by XML Base to
     resolve relative URIs in HTML and XHTML fragments. That is the mechanism
     used in this specification for resolving relative URIs in DOM trees. <a href="#refsXMLBASE">[XMLBASE]</a></p>

    <p class="note">It is possible for <code title="attr-xml-base">xml:base</code> attributes to be present even in
     HTML fragments, as such attributes can be added dynamically using
     script.</p>

   </dd><dt>DOM

   </dt><dd>
    <p>Implementations must support some version of DOM Core and DOM Events,
     because this specification is defined in terms of the DOM, and some of
     the features are defined as extensions to the DOM Core interfaces. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a> <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3EVENTS]</a></p>

   </dd><dt>ECMAScript

   </dt><dd>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
     this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
     ECMAScript Bindings for DOM Specifications specification, as this
     specification uses that specification's terminology. <a href="#refsEBFD">[EBFD]</a></p>
  </dd></dl>

  <p>This specification does not require support of any particular network
   transport protocols, image formats, audio formats, video formats, style
   sheet language, scripting language, or any of the DOM and WebAPI
   specifications beyond those described above. However, the language
   described by this specification is biased towards CSS as the styling
   language, ECMAScript as the scripting language, and HTTP as the network
   protocol, and several features assume that those languages and protocols
   are in use.

  </p><h4 id="features"><span class="secno">1.3.3. </span>Features defined in other
   specifications</h4>

  <p>Some elements are defined in terms of their DOM <dfn id="textcontent"><code>textContent</code></dfn> attribute. This is an
   attribute defined on the <code>Node</code> interface in DOM3 Core. <a href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a>

  </p><p class="big-issue">Should textContent be defined differently for dir=&quot;&quot; and

  to textContent. XXX also add event-click, event-change,
  event-DOMActivate, etc, here, and just have the section be a general

   defined in the DOM3 Events specification. <a href="#refsDOM3EVENTS">[DOM3EVENTS]</a> <span class="big-issue">At the time
   of writing, DOM3 Events hadn't yet been updated to define that
