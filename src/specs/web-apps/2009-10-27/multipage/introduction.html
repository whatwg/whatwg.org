  <h2 id="introduction"><span class="secno">1 </span>Introduction</h2>


  <h3 id="background"><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Background</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML
  was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing
  scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations
  over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of
  other types of documents.</p>

  <p>The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a
  vague subject referred to as Web Applications. This specification
  attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML
  specifications to address issues raised in the past few years.</p>


  <h3 id="audience"><span class="secno">1.2 </span>Audience</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and
  scripts that use the features defined in this specification<span class="impl">, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use
  the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing
  to establish the correctness of documents or implementations with
  respect to the requirements of this specification</span>.</p>

  <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not
  already have at least a passing familiarity with Web technologies,
  as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for
  completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can
  provide a gentler introduction to the topic.</p>

  <p>In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM Core and DOM
  Events is necessary for a complete understanding of some of the more
  technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL,
  HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will
  also be helpful in places but is not essential.</p>


  <h3 id="scope"><span class="secno">1.3 </span>Scope</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level
  markup language and associated semantic-level scripting APIs for
  authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents
  to dynamic applications.</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing
  mechanisms for media-specific customization of presentation
  (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
  the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking
  into CSS are provided as part of the language).</p>

  <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire
  operating system. In particular, hardware configuration software,
  image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out
  of scope. In terms of applications, this specification is targeted
  specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by
  users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate
  locations, with low CPU requirements. For instance online purchasing
  systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer online
  games), public telephone books or address books, communications
  software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion
  software), document editing software, etc.</p>


  <h3 id="history-1"><span class="secno">1.4 </span>History</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number
  of revisions and experienced a number of extensions, primarily
  hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>

  <p>With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue
  again. A first abortive attempt at extending HTML in 1995 known as
  HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML
  3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 followed, reaching
  completion in 1998.</p>

  <p>At this time, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML
  and instead begin work on an XML-based equivalent, called
  XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML,
  known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new
  serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the
  W3C's focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to
  extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel
  with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not
  compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it
  XHTML2.</p>

  <p>Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts
  of the API for HTML developed by browser vendors were specified and
  published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2 Core
  and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in
  2003). These efforts then petered out, with some DOM Level 3
  specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed
  before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was
  positioned as the next generation of Web forms, sparked a renewed
  interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements
  for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML's
  deployment as a Web technology was limited to entirely new
  technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement
  for existing deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>

  <p>A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's
  forms to provide many of the features that XForms 1.0 introduced,
  without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were
  incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of
  this renewed interest. At this early stage, while the draft was
  already publicly available, and input was already being solicited
  from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's
  copyright.</p>

  <p>The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a
  W3C workshop in 2004, where some of the principles that underlie the
  HTML5 work (described below), as well as the aforementioned early
  draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented
  to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected
  on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously
  chosen direction for the Web's evolution; the W3C staff and
  membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements
  instead.</p>

  <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced
  their intent to continue working on the effort under the umbrella of
  a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was created,
  and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was
  subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three vendors, and
  to allow reuse of the specification.</p>

  <p>The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular
  that technologies need to be backwards compatible, that
  specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
  changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that
  specifications need to be detailed enough that implementations can
  achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering each
  other.</p>

  <p>The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of
  the HTML5 specification include what had previously been specified
  in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It also
  meant including significantly more detail than had previously been
  considered the norm.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the
  development of HTML5 after all, and in 2007 formed a working group
  chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5
  specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish
  the specification under the W3C copyright, while keeping a version
  with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.</p>

  <p>Since then, both groups have been working together.</p>

  <p>A separate document has been published by the W3C HTML working
  group to document the differences between this specification and the
  language described in the HTML4 specification. <a href="references.html#refsHTMLDIFF">[HTMLDIFF]</a></p>




  <h3 id="design-notes"><span class="secno">1.5 </span>Design notes</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first
  glance to be nonsensical and inconsistent.</p>

  <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting
  technologies, have been developed over a period of several decades
  by a wide array of people with different priorities who, in many
  cases, did not know of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always
  been designed in especially consistent ways. Furthermore, because of
  the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation bugs have
  often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is
  often unintentionally written in ways that rely on them before they
  can be fixed.</p>

  <p>Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain
  design goals. These are described in the next few subsections.</p>


  <h4 id="serializability-of-script-execution"><span class="secno">1.5.1 </span>Serializability of script execution</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of
  multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are designed such that no
  script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other
  scripts. Even with <span title="Worker">workers</span>, the intent
  is that the behavior of implementations can be thought of as
  completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all <a href="browsers.html#browsing-context" title="browsing context">browsing contexts</a>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code title="dom-navigator-yieldForStorageUpdates"><a href="timers.html#dom-navigator-yieldforstorageupdates">navigator.yieldForStorageUpdates()</a></code>
  method, in this model, is equivalent to allowing other scripts to
  run while the calling script is blocked.</p>


  <h4 id="compliance-with-other-specifications"><span class="secno">1.5.2 </span>Compliance with other specifications</h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of
  other specifications. In certain circumstances, unfortunately, the
  desire to be compatible with legacy content has led to this
  specification violating the requirements of these other
  specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions have
  each been noted as a "<dfn id="willful-violation">willful violation</dfn>".</p>




  <h3 id="html-vs-xhtml"><span class="secno">1.6 </span>HTML vs XHTML</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing
  documents and applications, and some APIs for interacting with
  in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>

  <p>The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM"
  for short. This specification defines version 5 of DOM HTML, known
  as "DOM5 HTML".</p>

  <p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit
  resources that use this abstract language, two of which are defined
  in this specification.</p>

  <p>The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the
  format suggested for most authors. It is compatible with most legacy
  Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the <a href="infrastructure.html#mime-type">MIME
  type</a> <code><a href="iana.html#text/html">text/html</a></code>, then it will be processed as an
  HTML document by Web browsers. This specification defines version 5
  of the HTML syntax, known as "HTML5".</p>

  <p>The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an
  application of XML. When a document is transmitted with an <a href="infrastructure.html#xml-mime-type">XML
  MIME type</a>, such as <code><a href="iana.html#application/xhtml+xml">application/xhtml+xml</a></code>, then
  it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an
  XML processor. Authors are reminded that the processing for XML and
  HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent a
  document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they
  would be ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification defines
  version 5 of the XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5".</p>

  <p>The DOM, the HTML syntax, and XML cannot all represent the same
  content. For example, namespaces cannot be represented using the
  HTML syntax, but they are supported in the DOM and in XML.
  Similarly, documents that use the <code><a href="scripting-1.html#the-noscript-element">noscript</a></code> feature can
  be represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with
  the DOM or in XML. Comments that contain the string "<code title="">--&gt;</code>" can be represented in the DOM but not in the
  HTML syntax or in XML.</p>


  <h3 id="structure-of-this-specification"><span class="secno">1.7 </span>Structure of this specification</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>This specification is divided into the following major
  sections:</p>

  <dl><dt><a href="infrastructure.html#infrastructure">Common Infrastructure</a></dt>

   <dd>The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the
   common underpinnings of the rest of the specification.</dd>


   <dt><a href="dom.html#dom">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</a></dt>

   <dd>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree
   using the DOM. This section defines the features of this DOM, as
   well as introducing the features common to all elements, and the
   concepts used in defining elements.</dd>


   <dt><a href="semantics.html#semantics">Elements</a></dt>

   <dd>Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in
   this section. Rules for authors on how to use the element<span class="impl">, along with user agent requirements for how to handle
   each element,</span> are also given.</dd>


   <dt><a href="microdata.html#microdata">Microdata</a></dt>

   <dd>This specification introduces a mechanism for adding
   machine-readable annotations to documents, so that tools can
   extract trees of name/value pairs from the document. This section
   describes this mechanism<span class="impl"> and some algorithms
   that can be used to convert HTML documents into other
   formats</span>.
   </dd>


   <dt><a href="browsers.html#browsers">Web Browsers</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum &mdash; this section
   defines many of the features that affect environments that deal
   with multiple pages, links between pages, and running scripts.</dd>


   <dt><a href="editing.html#editing">User Interaction</a></dt>

   <dd>HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to
   interact with and modify content, which are described in this
   section.</dd>


   <dt><a href="comms.html#comms">The Communication APIs</a></dt>

   <dd>This section describes some mechanisms that applications
   written in HTML can use to communicate with other applications from
   different domains running on the same client.
   </dd>


   <dt><a href="syntax.html#syntax">The HTML Syntax</a></dt>
   <dt><a href="the-xhtml-syntax.html#xhtml">The XHTML Syntax</a></dt>

   <dd>All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be
   represented in a serialized form and sent to other people, and so
   these sections define the syntaxes of HTML, along with rules for
   how to parse content using those syntaxes.</dd>


  </dl><p>There are also some appendices, defining <a href="rendering.html#rendering">rendering rules</a> for Web browsers and listing
  <a href="obsolete.html#obsolete">obsolete features</a> and <a href="iana.html#iana">IANA
  considerations</a>.</p>


  <h4 id="how-to-read-this-specification"><span class="secno">1.7.1 </span>How to read this specification</h4>

  <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications.
  First, it should be read cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it
  should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by
  picking random sections from the contents list and following all the
  cross-references.</p>


  <h4 id="typographic-conventions"><span class="secno">1.7.2 </span>Typographic conventions</h4>

  <h3 id="a-quick-introduction-to-html"><span class="secno">1.8 </span>A quick introduction to HTML</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>A basic HTML document looks like this:</p>

  <pre id="intro-early-example">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample page&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Sample page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="demo.html"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt; sample.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  <p>HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Each
  element is denoted in the source by a <a href="syntax.html#syntax-start-tag" title="syntax-start-tag">start tag</a>, such as "<code title="">&lt;body&gt;</code>", and an <a href="syntax.html#syntax-end-tag" title="syntax-end-tag">end
  tag</a>, such as "<code title="">&lt;/body&gt;</code>". (Certain
  start tags and end tags can in certain cases be <a href="syntax.html#syntax-tag-omission" title="syntax-tag-omission">omitted</a> and are implied by other
  tags.)</p>

  <p>Tags have to be nested such that elements are all completely
  within each other, without overlapping:</p>

  <pre class="bad">&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;very &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
  <pre>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

  <p>This specification defines a set of elements that can be used in
  HTML, along with rules about the ways in which the elements can be
  nested.</p>

  <p>Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements
  work. In the example below, there is a <a href="links.html#hyperlink">hyperlink</a>,
  formed using the <code><a href="text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">a</a></code> element and its <code title="attr-hyperlink-href"><a href="links.html#attr-hyperlink-href">href</a></code> attribute:</p>

  <pre>&lt;a href="demo.html"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

  <p><a href="syntax.html#syntax-attributes" title="syntax-attributes">Attributes</a> are placed
  inside the start tag, and consist of a <a href="syntax.html#syntax-attribute-name" title="syntax-attribute-name">name</a> and a <a href="syntax.html#syntax-attribute-value" title="syntax-attribute-value">value</a>, separated by an "<code title="">=</code>" character. The attribute value can be left <a href="syntax.html#unquoted">unquoted</a> if it doesn't contain spaces or any of
  <code title="">"</code> <code title="">'</code> <code title="">`</code> <code title="">=</code> <code title="">&lt;</code>
  or <code title="">&gt;</code>. Otherwise, it has to be quoted using
  either single or double quotes. The value, along with the "<code title="">=</code>" character, can be omitted altogether if the value
  is the empty string.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!-- empty attributes --&gt;
&lt;input name=address disabled&gt;
&lt;input name=address disabled=""&gt;

&lt;!-- attributes with a value --&gt;
&lt;input name=address maxlength=200&gt;
&lt;input name=address maxlength='200'&gt;
&lt;input name=address maxlength="200"&gt;</pre>

  <p>HTML user agents (e.g. Web browsers) then <i>parse</i> this
  markup, turning it into a DOM (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM
  tree is an in-memory representation of a document.</p>

  <p>DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a DOCTYPE
  node, elements, text nodes, and comment nodes.</p>

  <p>The <a href="#intro-early-example">markup snippet at the top of
  this section</a> would be turned into the following DOM tree:</p>

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t10">DOCTYPE: <code><a href="semantics.html#the-html-element-0">html</a></code><li class="t1"><code><a href="semantics.html#the-html-element-0">html</a></code><ul><li class="t1"><code><a href="semantics.html#the-head-element-0">head</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;&#9251;</span><li class="t1"><code><a href="semantics.html#the-title-element-0">title</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">Sample page</span></ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;</span></ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;</span><li class="t1"><code><a href="sections.html#the-body-element-0">body</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;&#9251;</span><li class="t1"><code><a href="sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h1</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">Sample page</span></ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;&#9251;</span><li class="t1"><code><a href="grouping-content.html#the-p-element">p</a></code><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">This is a </span><li class="t1"><code><a href="text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">a</a></code> <span class="t2" title=""><code class="attribute name">href</code>="<code class="attribute value">demo.html</code>"</span><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">simple</span></ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title=""> sample.</span></ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;&#9251;</span><li class="t8"><code>#comment</code>: <span title=""> this is a comment </span><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span title="">&#9166;&#9251;&#9166;</span></ul></ul></ul><p>The <a href="infrastructure.html#root-element">root element</a> of this tree is the
  <code><a href="semantics.html#the-html-element-0">html</a></code> element, which is the element always found at the
  root of HTML documents. It contains two elements, <code><a href="semantics.html#the-head-element-0">head</a></code>
  and <code><a href="sections.html#the-body-element-0">body</a></code>, as well as a text node between them.</p>

  <p>There are many more text nodes in the DOM tree than one would
  initially expect, because the source contains a number of spaces
  (represented here by "&#9251;") and line breaks ("&#9166;") that
  all end up as text nodes in the DOM.</p>

  <p>The <code><a href="semantics.html#the-head-element-0">head</a></code> element contains a <code><a href="semantics.html#the-title-element-0">title</a></code>
  element, which itself contains a text node with the text "Sample
  page". Similarly, the <code><a href="sections.html#the-body-element-0">body</a></code> element contains an
  <code><a href="sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h1</a></code> element, a <code><a href="grouping-content.html#the-p-element">p</a></code> element, and a
  comment.</p>

  <hr><p>This DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the
  page. Scripts (typically in JavaScript) are small programs that can
  be embedded using the <code><a href="scripting-1.html#script">script</a></code> element or using
  <a href="origin-0.html#event-handler-content-attributes">event handler content attributes</a>. For example, here is
  a form with a script that sets the value of the form's
  <code><a href="the-button-element.html#the-output-element">output</a></code> element to say "Hello World":</p>

  <pre>&lt;<a href="forms.html#the-form-element">form</a> <a href="forms.html#attr-form-name" title="attr-form-name">name</a>="main"&gt;
 Result: &lt;<a href="the-button-element.html#the-output-element">output</a> <a href="association-of-controls-and-forms.html#attr-fe-name" title="attr-fe-name">name</a>="result"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
 &lt;<a href="scripting-1.html#script">script</a>&gt;
  <a href="dom.html#htmldocument" title="HTMLDocument">document</a>.<a href="dom.html#dom-document-forms" title="dom-document-forms">forms</a>.main.<a href="forms.html#dom-form-elements" title="dom-form-elements">elements</a>.result.<a href="the-button-element.html#dom-output-value" title="dom-output-value">value</a> = 'Hello World';
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

  <p>Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and
  these objects have APIs so that they can be manipulated. For
  instance, a link (e.g. the <code><a href="text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">a</a></code> element in the tree above)
  can have its "<code title="attr-hyperlink-href"><a href="links.html#attr-hyperlink-href">href</a></code>"
  attribute changed in several ways:</p>

  <pre>var a = <a href="dom.html#htmldocument" title="HTMLDocument">document</a>.<a href="dom.html#dom-document-links" title="dom-document-links">links</a>[0]; // obtain the first link in the document
a.<a href="text-level-semantics.html#dom-a-href" title="dom-a-href">href</a> = 'sample.html'; // change the destination URL of the link
a.<a href="urls.html#dom-uda-protocol" title="dom-uda-protocol">protocol</a> = 'https'; // change just the scheme part of the URL
a.setAttribute('href', 'http://example.com/'); // change the content attribute directly</pre>

  <p>Since DOM trees are used as the way to represent HTML documents
  when they are processed and presented by implementations (especially
  interactive implementations like Web browsers), this specification
  is mostly phrased in terms of DOM trees, instead of the markup
  described above.</p>

  <hr><p>HTML documents represent a media-independent description of
  interactive content. HTML documents might be rendered to a screen,
  or through a speech synthesizer, or on a braille display. To
  influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a
  styling language such as CSS.</p>

  <p>In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue
  using CSS.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample styled page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
   body { background: navy; color: yellow; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Sample styled page&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This page is just a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

  <p>For more details on how to use HTML, authors are encouraged to
  consult tutorials and guides. Some of the examples included in this
  specification might also be of use, but the novice author is
  cautioned that this specification, by necessity, defines the
  language with a level of detail that might be difficult to
  understand at first.</p>
