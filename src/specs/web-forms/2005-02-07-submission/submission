  <h1>Web Forms 2.0 Submission request to W3C</h1>
  <h2>Submitted Materials</h2>
  <p>We, W3C Members <em>Opera Software ASA</em> and <em>Mozilla
  Foundation</em> hereby submit to the Consortium the following
  specification, comprising the following document(s) attached hereto:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><em><a href="./index">Web Forms 2.0</a></em></li>
  </ol>
  <p>...which collectively are referred to as "the Submission". We
  request the Submission be known as the <em>Web Forms 2.0</em>
  Submission.</p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This specification defines Web Forms 2.0, a <em>backwards
  compatible</em> extension to the forms features found in HTML 4.01's
  Forms chapter and the corresponding DOM 2 HTML interfaces. Web Forms
  2.0 applies to both HTML and XHTML user agents. It provides new
  strongly-typed input fields, new attributes for defining
  constraints, a repeating model for declarative repeating of form
  sections, new DOM interfaces, new DOM events for validation and
  dependency tracking, and XML submission and initialization of forms.
  It also standardises and codifies existing practice in areas that
  have not been previously documented, and clarifies some of the
  interactions of HTML form controls and CSS.</p>
  <p>HTML4, XHTML1.1, and the DOM are thus extended in a manner that
  has a clear migration path from existing HTML forms, leveraging the
  knowledge authors have built up with their experience with HTML so
  far.</p>
  <p>This work is the direct result of discussion on the <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> <a
  href="http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list">public mailing
  list</a>.</p>
