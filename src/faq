  <h4 id="what-is-the-whatwg">What is the WHATWG?<a class="self-link" href="#what-is-the-whatwg"></a></h4>

  <p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) is a growing community of
  people interested in evolving the Web. It focuses primarily on the development of HTML and APIs
  needed for Web applications.

  <p>The WHATWG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in
  2004, after a W3C workshop. Apple, Mozilla and Opera were becoming increasingly concerned about
  the W3C’s direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML and apparent disregard for the needs of
  real-world authors. So, in response, these organisations set out with a mission to address these
  concerns and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group was born.

  <h4 id="spell-and-pronounce">How do you spell and pronounce WHATWG?<a class="self-link" href="#spell-and-pronounce"></a></h4>

  <p>It is spelled WHATWG, all uppercase, no spaces. It has various pronunciations: what-wee-gee,
  what-wig, what-double-you-gee.

  <h4 id="what-is-the-whatwg-working-on">What is the WHATWG working on?<a class="self-link" href="#what-is-the-whatwg-working-on"></a></h4>

  <p>The WHATWG's main focus is Web standards, specifically:

  <ul>
   <li><p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a>, which also includes Web
   Workers, Web Storage, the Web Sockets API, Server-Sent Events, Microdata, and the 2D Canvas.

   <li><p><a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch</a>, including the <code>fetch()</code> API

   <li><p><a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">DOM</a>, including DOM Events, DOM range, and
   mutation observers

   <li><p><a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">URLs</a>, including an API for URLs
  </ul>

  <p>...and <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/">a number of other specs</a>.

  <h4 id="get-involved">How can I get involved?<a class="self-link" href="#get-involved"></a></h4>

  <p>There are lots of ways you can get involved, take a look and see
  <i><a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/What_you_can_do">What you can do</a></i>!

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hneN6aW-d9w">This video from Domenic Denicola</a> is a
  good introduction to working with standards bodies.

  <h4 id="is-participation-free">Is participation free?<a class="self-link" href="#is-participation-free"></a></h4>

  <p>Yes, everyone can contribute. There are no memberships fees involved, it's an open process. You
  may easily <a href="https://github.com/whatwg">participate on GitHub</a> or subscribe to the
  <a href="/mailing-list">WHATWG mailing lists</a>. There are no meetings, since meetings prevent
  people with limited time or money from participating.

  <h4 id="code-of-conduct">Is there a Code of Conduct?<a class="self-link" href="#code-of-conduct"></a></h4>

  <p>Yes, see <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. Please read it and respect it.

  <h3 id="process">The WHATWG Process<a class="self-link" href="#process"></a></h3>

  <h4 id="how-does-the-whatwg-work">How does the WHATWG work?<a class="self-link" href="#how-does-the-whatwg-work"></a></h4>

  <p>People <a href="https://github.com/whatwg">collaborate on GitHub</a> or send email to
  <a href="/mailing-list#specs">the mailing list</a>.

  <p>Each standard has one or more editors, who are responsible for dealing with feedback for that
  document. Those editors read all the feedback, and, taking it into account along with research,
  studies, and feedback from many other sources (blogs, forums, IRC, etc.) make language design
  decisions intended to address everyone's needs as well as possible while keeping the languages and
  APIs consistent.

  <p>This continues, with people sending more feedback, until nobody is able to convince the
  relevant editor to change the spec any more (e.g., because two people want opposite things, and
  the editor has considered all the information available and decided that one of the two proposals
  is the better one).

  <p>For new features, or significant changes to the processing models, the relevant editor will
  typically describe the intended changes in the relevant bug or mailing list thread to give people
  a chance to point out problems with it before the spec is updated. Implementors, especially, are
  urged to indicate on such threads whether they approve of the suggested changes or new feature, so
  that we can avoid the spec containing material which implementors are later found to disagree
  with.

  <p>This is not a consensus-based approach — there's no guarantee that everyone will be happy!
  There is also no voting. There is a small oversight committee (known historically as the "WHATWG
  members", from the name that the original <a href="/charter">charter</a> used, though that
  terminology is misleading) who have the authority to override or replace editors if they start
  making bad decisions, but so far that has never happened in over ten years. This committee has a
  private mailing list, but it receives very few messages, usually going years with no emails at
  all. Discussions on that list are summarized and described on the public list, to make sure
  everyone is kept up to date.

  <h4 id="what-happens-with-discussions">What happens with WHATWG mailing list/GitHub issue discussions?<a class="self-link" href="#what-happens-with-discussions"></a></h4>

  <p>On the WHATWG list and in WHATWG issues on GitHub, the burden is on the spec editors to
  evaluate the various positions that have been put forward in a discussion, and figure out which
  one is strongest (or find another position that strikes a better balance between all of them).

  <p>The purpose of debate at the WHATWG therefore isn't to convince everyone; it is to put forward
  the arguments that exist, so that the relevant editor can make a well-informed decision. As a
  corollary: If some points are made, rebutted, and not further defended, then maybe the person
  making the arguments is hoping that the relevant editor will consider the rebuttals weak, or
  thinks that the argument they have presented is strong despite the rebuttals. If you find someone
  is not making good arguments, or is ignoring your arguments, your best bet is to stop responding.
  Repeating previously-stated arguments doesn't help, since the editors will see all the arguments
  when they look at the thread. Similarly, as soon as threads start being meta-threads about
  people's argumentation behaviour, we stop making any kind of useful progress, since that isn't
  input that can help the decision-making process later.

  <h4 id="how-to-interact">How should tool developers, screen reader developers, browser vendors, search engine vendors, and other implementors interact with the WHATWG?<a class="self-link" href="#how-to-interact"></a></h4>

  <p>File an issue on the <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/">relevant standard</a> as indicated at
  the top of that standard. All feedback is supposed to be addressed in due course. You are also
  welcome to take a stab at addressing the problem yourself through a GitHub pull request.

  <p><b>If you want feedback to be dealt with faster than "eventually", e.g., because you are about
  to work on that feature and need the spec to be updated to take into account all previous
  feedback, let the editors know</b> by either emailing them, or contacting them on
  <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>. Requests for priority feedback handling are
  handled confidentially if desired so other implementers won't know that you are working on that
  feature.

  <h4 id="removing-bad-ideas">Is there a process for removing bad ideas from a specification?<a class="self-link" href="#removing-bad-ideas"></a></h4>

  <p>There are several processes by which we trim weeds from the specifications.

  <ul>
   <li><p>Occasionally, we go through every section and mark areas as being considered for removal.
   This happened early in 2008 with the data templates, repetition blocks, and DFN-element cross
   references, for example. If no feedback is received to give us strong reasons to keep such
   features, then they eventually are removed altogether.

   <li><p>Anyone can ask for a feature to be removed; such feedback is considered like all other
   feedback and is based on the merits of the arguments put forward. If it's been a few years and
   there's no implementation, and no vendor is showing any interest in eventually implementing that
   section; or if it's a section that browsers previously implemented but where the momentum shows
   that browsers are actually removing support, then it is highly likely that the request to remove
   the section will be honoured. (Sometimes, a warning is first placed in the spec, as
   with <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#dialogs-implemented-using-separate-documents">showModalDialog()</a>.)

   <li><p>If browsers don't widely implement a feature, or if authors don't use a feature, or if the
   uses of the feature are inconsequential or fundamentally wrong or damaging, then, after due
   consideration, features will be removed.
  </ul>

  <p>Removing features is a critical part of spec development.

  <h4 id="adding-new-features">Is there a process for adding new features to a specification?<a class="self-link" href="#adding-new-features"></a></h4>

  <p>The process is rather informal, but basically boils down to this:

  <ol>
   <li><p>Forget about the particular solution you have in mind! Solution time is later!

   <li><p>Write down a description of the underlying problem you're trying to solve. What are the
   use cases? A use case is an actual user wanting to do something. Then list requirements for each
   use case. For a good example of how to do this, see
   <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JulSep/0835.html">this email</a>.

   <li><p>Get more people involved. Open a new issue in
   <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues">whatwg/html on GitHub</a> that describes the use
   cases and their requirements. Ask fellow Web developers about their opinions (but remind them of
   step 1 above). Adjust the list of use cases and requirements as appropriate. Say which use cases
   are important and which are just nice to have.

   <li><p>Optionally, your work is done at this point. If you have done a good job of the above
   steps and convinced other people that your use case is an important one to solve, they can do the
   remaining steps. (On the flip side, if nobody else cares about the use case, chances are
   solutions for it will not succeed despite being awesome.)

   <li><p>Research existing solutions. Come up with new solutions. Try to keep the solutions as
   simple as possible, maybe only addressing the important use cases and leaving the nice to have
   use cases for later (when there's implementation experience). Send this list of solutions, old
   and new, as a comment on the feature's issue. Ask browser vendors for feedback. Maybe some
   particular solutions don't fit with the browser's architecture, optimizations, etc., and just are
   not going to be implemented no matter how much you like them. Strike those solutions and don't
   grieve about the loss!

   <li><p>Evaluate how well each of the remaining solutions address each use case and how well they
   meet the requirements. This step should show which solution is the technically best fit (might
   turn out to be someone else's solution).

   <li><p>Ask the spec's editor to put that solution in the spec, or create a pull request on GitHub
   yourself. Possibly your text won't be taken verbatim but will be written in a style that is more
   suitable for implementors or better hooks in to the rest of the spec, etc.

   <li><p>Ask browser vendors to implement the newly specified solution, even if it's just an
   experimental implementation. This implementation experience usually means that new problems are
   found with the solution that need to be addressed, or that a different solution is actually
   better.

   <li><p>Write a test suite for the feature to see if the implementations match the spec. This
   usually highlights bugs in the implementations and also bugs in the spec.

   <li><p>Participate in subsequent design discussions. When there are two or more mature
   implementations, it may be time to extend the feature to address the nice to have use cases (but
   this whole process should be repeated even for such extensions).
  </ol>

  <p>If the idea survives the above design process, the spec will be eventually updated to reflect
  the new design. Implementations will then be updated to reflect the new design (if they aren't,
  that indicates the new design is not good, and it will be reworked or removed). The spec will be
  updated to fix the many problems discovered by authors and implementors, over a period of several
  years, as more authors and implementors are exposed to the design. Eventually, a number of
  provably interoperable implementations are deployed. At this point development of the feature is
  somewhat frozen.

  <p>Writing a comprehensive test suite is also an important step, which can even start before
  implementations start being written to the spec. Cross-browser tests for HTML are maintained in
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/html">w3c/web-platform-tests/html
  on GitHub</a>.

  <h4 id="should-i-send-new-proposed-text">Should I send new proposed text when I have a suggestion?<a class="self-link" href="#should-i-send-new-proposed-text"></a></h4>

  <p>Please do not suggest new text, instead, say what is wrong with the current text. Just
  proposing new text makes it impossible for the editor to determine if the problem is endemic
  (requiring more changes than you realise), or whether what the editor thinks of as mistakes in the
  new proposed text are intentional or not (and should be fixed or not), or whether stylistic
  differences are intentional or not, etc.

  <h4 id="living-standard">What does "Living Standard" mean?<a class="self-link" href="#living-standard"></a></h4>

  <p>The WHATWG specifications are described as Living Standards. This means that they are standards
  that are continuously updated as they receive feedback, either from Web designers, browser
  vendors, tool vendors, or indeed any other interested party. It also means that new features get
  added to them over time, at a rate intended to keep the specifications a little ahead of the
  implementations but not so far ahead that the implementations give up.

  <p>Despite the continuous maintenance, or maybe we should say <i>as part</i> of the continuing
  maintenance, a significant effort is placed on getting the specifications and the implementations
  to converge — the parts of the specification that are mature and stable are not changed willy
  nilly. Maintenance means that the days where the specifications are brought down from the mountain
  and remain forever locked, even if it turns out that all the browsers do something else, or even
  if it turns out that the specification left some detail out and the browsers all disagree on how
  to implement it, are gone. Instead, we now make sure to update the specifications to be detailed
  enough that all the implementations (not just browsers, of course) can do the same thing. Instead
  of ignoring what the browsers do, we fix the spec to match what the browsers do. Instead of
  leaving the specification ambiguous, we fix the the specification to define how things work.

  <h4 id="change-at-any-time">Does that mean the specifications can change at any time?<a class="self-link" href="#change-at-any-time"></a></h4>

  <p>The specifications do not change arbitrarily: we are extremely careful! As parts of a
  specification mature, and implementations ship, the spec cannot be changed in
  backwards-incompatible ways (because the implementors would never agree to break compatibility
  unless for security reasons). The specifications are never complete, since the Web is continuously
  evolving. The last time HTML was described as "complete" was after HTML4, when development stopped
  for several years, leading to stagnation. (If the Web is replaced by something better and dies,
  the HTML spec will die with it.)

  <p>For references to stable copies of the specifications, some WHATWG specifications follows a
  process by which each change to the specification (embodied in a commit) triggers the publication
  of a frozen snapshot of the said specification.

  <p>These snapshots are published as historical references. The WHATWG intends to keep these frozen
  snapshots available at their published URL permanently.

  <h4 id="patent-policy">What's the patent story for WHATWG standards?<a class="self-link" href="#patent-policy"></a></h4>

  <p>The WHATWG operates as a W3C Community Group and thus uses the W3C Community Group patent
  policies. So far we have published one FSA with
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/whatwg/spec/82/commitments">patent commitments</a> from
  Google, Mozilla, and others covering the URL standard.
  <a href="https://blog.whatwg.org/make-patent-commitments">You can make patent commitments too!</a>
  Some of our specifications have also been forked and republished by the W3C with patent
  commitments from certain companies.

  <h4 id="translating">What is the process for translating WHATWG standards?<a class="self-link" href="#translating"></a></h4>

  <p>Many WHATWG standards have been translated into other languages by the WHATWG community. This
  is great, and highly encouraged!

  <p>In general, if you translate a WHATWG Standard, please communicate with the maintainers of the
  standard (e.g. via a GitHub issue) letting them know about your work. In general this will lead to
  adding a link to your translation to the top of the original specification, to allow interested
  readers to view it. You can see examples of this in many WHATWG standards, e.g.
  <a href="https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/">https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/</a>.

  <p>Such translations are not normative (i.e., implementations should be sure to consult the
  original). Due to the nature of living standards, which can change often, it's possible for
  translations to become out of date compared to the original standard. If the translation shows
  signs of no longer being maintained, or has other quality problems, community members are
  encouraged to provide feedback to the maintainers of the standard, so that any links to the
  translation can be removed in order to avoid confusing readers.

  <p>Note that WHATWG specifications are always licensed under liberal licenses that allow the
  creation of derivative works like translations.
