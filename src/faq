  <h4 id="what-is-the-whatwg">What is the WHATWG?<a class="self-link" href="#what-is-the-whatwg"></a></h4>

  <p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) is a community of people
  interested in evolving the web through standards and tests.

  <p>The WHATWG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in
  2004, after a W3C workshop. Apple, Mozilla and Opera were becoming increasingly concerned about
  the W3C’s direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML, and apparent disregard for the needs of
  real-world web developers. So, in response, these organisations set out with a mission to address
  these concerns and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group was born.

  <h4 id="spell-and-pronounce">How do you spell and pronounce WHATWG?<a class="self-link" href="#spell-and-pronounce"></a></h4>

  <p>It is spelled WHATWG, all uppercase, no spaces. It has various pronunciations: what-wee-gee,
  what-wig, what-double-you-gee.

  <h4 id="what-is-the-whatwg-working-on">What is the WHATWG working on?<a class="self-link" href="#what-is-the-whatwg-working-on"></a></h4>

  <p>The WHATWG’s main focus is web standards and their associated tests, specifically:

  <ul>
   <li><p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a>, which also includes Web
   Workers, Web Storage, the Web Sockets API, Server-Sent Events, Microdata, and the 2D Canvas.

   <li><p><a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch</a>, including the <code>fetch()</code> API

   <li><p><a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">DOM</a>, including DOM Events, DOM range, and
   mutation observers

   <li><p><a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">URL</a>, including an API for URLs
  </ul>

  <p>...and <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/">a number of other standards</a>.

  <h4 id="get-involved">How can I get involved?<a class="self-link" href="#get-involved"></a></h4>

  <p>There are lots of ways you can get involved, take a look and see
  <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/What_you_can_do">What you can do</a>!

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hneN6aW-d9w">This video from Domenic Denicola</a> is a
  good introduction to working with standards bodies.

  <h4 id="is-participation-free">Is participation free?<a class="self-link" href="#is-participation-free"></a></h4>

  <p>Yes, everyone can contribute. There are no memberships fees involved, it’s an open process. You
  may easily <a href="https://github.com/whatwg">participate on GitHub</a> or subscribe to the
  <a href="/mailing-list">WHATWG mailing lists</a>. There are no meetings, since meetings prevent
  people with limited time or money from participating.

  <h3 id="process">The WHATWG Process<a class="self-link" href="#process"></a></h3>

  <h4 id="how-does-the-whatwg-work">How does the WHATWG work?<a class="self-link" href="#how-does-the-whatwg-work"></a></h4>

  <p><a href="/working-mode">Working Mode</a> describes the day-to-day process in detail. Most of
  the activity consists of <a href="https://github.com/whatwg">collaboration on GitHub</a>.

  <h4 id="what-happens-with-discussions">What happens with WHATWG mailing list/GitHub issue discussions?<a class="self-link" href="#what-happens-with-discussions"></a></h4>

  <p>On the WHATWG list and in WHATWG issues on GitHub, the burden is on the editors to evaluate the
  various positions that have been put forward in a discussion, and figure out which one is
  strongest (or find another position that strikes a better balance between all of them).

  <p>The purpose of debate at the WHATWG therefore isn’t to convince everyone; it is to put forward
  the arguments that exist, so that the relevant editor can make a well-informed decision. As a
  corollary: If some points are made, rebutted, and not further defended, then maybe the person
  making the arguments is hoping that the relevant editor will consider the rebuttals weak, or
  thinks that the argument they have presented is strong despite the rebuttals. If you find someone
  is not making good arguments, or is ignoring your arguments, your best bet is to stop responding.
  Repeating previously-stated arguments doesn’t help, since the editors will see all the arguments
  when they look at the thread. Similarly, as soon as threads start being meta-threads about
  people’s argumentation behaviour, we stop making any kind of useful progress, since that isn’t
  input that can help the decision-making process later.

  <h4 id="how-to-interact">How should tool developers, screen reader developers, browser vendors, search engine vendors, and other implementors interact with the WHATWG?<a class="self-link" href="#how-to-interact"></a></h4>

  <p>File an issue on the <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/">relevant standard</a> as indicated at
  the top of that standard. All feedback is supposed to be addressed in due course. You are also
  welcome to take a stab at addressing the problem yourself through a GitHub pull request.

  <p>If you want feedback to be dealt with faster than “eventually”, e.g., because you are about to
  work on that feature and need the standard to be updated to take into account all previous
  feedback, let the editors know by either emailing them, or contacting them on
  <a href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>. Requests for priority feedback handling are
  handled confidentially if desired so other implementers won’t know that you are working on that
  feature.

  <h4 id="removing-bad-ideas">Is there a process for removing bad ideas from a standard?<a class="self-link" href="#removing-bad-ideas"></a></h4>

  <p>There are several processes by which we trim weeds:

  <ul>
   <li><p>Occasionally, we go through every section and mark areas as being considered for removal.
   This happened early in 2008 with the data templates, repetition blocks, and DFN-element cross
   references, for example. If no feedback is received to give us strong reasons to keep such
   features, then they eventually are removed altogether.

   <li><p>Anyone can ask for a feature to be removed; such feedback is considered like all other
   feedback and is based on the merits of the arguments put forward. If it’s been a few years and
   there’s no implementation, and no vendor is showing any interest in eventually implementing that
   section; or if it’s a section that browsers previously implemented but where the momentum shows
   that browsers are actually removing support, then it is highly likely that the request to remove
   the section will be honoured. (Sometimes, a warning is first placed in the standard.)

   <li><p>If browsers don’t widely implement a feature, or if authors don’t use a feature, or if the
   uses of the feature are inconsequential or fundamentally wrong or damaging, then, after due
   consideration, features will be removed.
  </ul>

  <p>Removing features is a critical part of standards development.

  <h4 id="adding-new-features">Is there a process for adding new features to a standard?<a class="self-link" href="#adding-new-features"></a></h4>

  <p>The process is rather informal, but basically boils down to this:

  <ol>
   <li><p>Forget about the particular solution you have in mind! Solution time is later!

   <li><p>Write down a description of the underlying problem you’re trying to solve. What are the
   use cases? A use case is an actual user wanting to do something. Then list requirements for each
   use case. For a good example of how to do this, see
   <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JulSep/0835.html">this email</a>.

   <li><p>Get more people involved. Open a new issue in
   <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues">whatwg/html on GitHub</a> that describes the use
   cases and their requirements. Ask fellow Web developers about their opinions (but remind them of
   step 1 above). Adjust the list of use cases and requirements as appropriate. Say which use cases
   are important and which are just nice to have.

   <li><p>Optionally, your work is done at this point. If you have done a good job of the above
   steps and convinced other people that your use case is an important one to solve, they can do the
   remaining steps. (On the flip side, if nobody else cares about the use case, chances are
   solutions for it will not succeed despite being awesome.)

   <li><p>Research existing solutions. Come up with new solutions. Try to keep the solutions as
   simple as possible, maybe only addressing the important use cases and leaving the nice to have
   use cases for later (when there’s implementation experience). Send this list of solutions, old
   and new, as a comment on the feature’s issue. Ask browser vendors for feedback. Maybe some
   particular solutions don’t fit with the browser’s architecture, optimizations, etc., and just are
   not going to be implemented no matter how much you like them. Strike those solutions and don’t
   grieve about the loss!

   <li><p>Evaluate how well each of the remaining solutions address each use case and how well they
   meet the requirements. This step should show which solution is the technically best fit (might
   turn out to be someone else’s solution).

   <li><p>Ask the editor to put that solution in the standard, or create a pull request on GitHub
   yourself. Possibly your text won’t be taken verbatim but will be written in a style that is more
   suitable for implementors or better hooks in to the rest of the standard, etc.

   <li><p>Ask browser vendors to implement the newly specified solution, even if it’s just an
   experimental implementation. This implementation experience usually means that new problems are
   found with the solution that need to be addressed, or that a different solution is actually
   better.

   <li><p>Write a test suite for the feature to see if the implementations match the standard. This
   usually highlights bugs in the implementations and also bugs in the standard.

   <li><p>Participate in subsequent design discussions. When there are two or more mature
   implementations, it may be time to extend the feature to address the nice to have use cases (but
   this whole process should be repeated even for such extensions).
  </ol>

  <p>If the idea survives the above design process, the standard will be eventually updated to
  reflect the new design. Implementations will then be updated to reflect the new design (if they
  aren’t, that indicates the new design is not good, and it will be reworked or removed). The
  standard will be updated to fix the many problems discovered by authors and implementors, over a
  period of several years, as more authors and implementors are exposed to the design. Eventually, a
  number of provably interoperable implementations are deployed. At this point development of the
  feature is somewhat frozen.

  <p>Writing a comprehensive test suite is also an important step, which should start before
  implementations start being written to the standard. Cross-browser tests are maintained in
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests">web-platform-tests on GitHub</a>.

  <h4 id="should-i-send-new-proposed-text">Should I send new proposed text when I have a suggestion?<a class="self-link" href="#should-i-send-new-proposed-text"></a></h4>

  <p>Please do not suggest new text, instead, say what is wrong with the current text. Just
  proposing new text makes it impossible for the editor to determine if the problem is endemic
  (requiring more changes than you realise), or whether what the editor thinks of as mistakes in the
  new proposed text are intentional or not (and should be fixed or not), or whether stylistic
  differences are intentional or not, etc.

  <h4 id="living-standard">What does “Living Standard” mean?<a class="self-link" href="#living-standard"></a></h4>

  <p>The WHATWG standards are described as Living Standards. This means that they are standards
  that are continuously updated as they receive feedback, either from web designers, browser
  vendors, tool vendors, or indeed any other interested party. It also means that new features get
  added to them over time, at a rate intended to keep the standard a little ahead of the
  implementations, but not so far ahead that the implementations give up.

  <p>Despite the continuous maintenance, or maybe we should say <i>as part</i> of the continuing
  maintenance, a significant effort is placed on getting the standard and the implementations to
  converge — the parts of the standard that are mature and stable are not changed willy nilly.
  Maintenance means that the days where the standard are brought down from the mountain and remain
  forever locked, even if it turns out that all the browsers do something else, or even if it turns
  out that the standard left some detail out and the browsers all disagree on how to implement it,
  are gone. Instead, we now make sure to update the standard to be detailed enough that all the
  implementations (not just browsers, of course) can do the same thing. Instead of ignoring what the
  browsers do, we fix the standard to match what the browsers do. Instead of leaving the standard
  ambiguous, we fix the the standard to define how things work.

  <h4 id="change-at-any-time">Does that mean the standards can change at any time?<a class="self-link" href="#change-at-any-time"></a></h4>

  <p>The standards do not change arbitrarily: we are extremely careful! As parts of a standard
  mature, and implementations ship, the standard cannot be changed in backwards-incompatible ways
  (because the implementors would never agree to break compatibility unless for security reasons).
  The standards are never complete, since the web is continuously evolving. The last time HTML was
  described as “complete” was after HTML4, when development stopped for several years, leading to
  stagnation. (If the web is replaced by something better and dies, the HTML standard will die with
  it.)

  <p>For references to stable copies of the standard, most WHATWG standards follows a process by
  which each change to the standard (embodied in a commit) triggers the publication of a frozen
  snapshot of the said standard.

  <p>These snapshots are published as historical references. The WHATWG intends to keep these frozen
  snapshots available at their published URL permanently.

  <h4 id="patent-policy">What’s the patent story for WHATWG standards?<a class="self-link" href="#patent-policy"></a></h4>

  <p>The WHATWG operates as a W3C Community Group and thus uses the W3C Community Group patent
  policies. So far we have published one FSA with
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/whatwg/spec/82/commitments">patent commitments</a> from
  Google, Mozilla, and others covering the URL standard.
  <a href="https://blog.whatwg.org/make-patent-commitments">You can make patent commitments too!</a>
  Some of our standards have also been forked and republished by the W3C with patent commitments
  from certain companies.

  <h4 id="translating">What is the process for translating WHATWG standards?<a class="self-link" href="#translating"></a></h4>

  <p>Many WHATWG standards have been translated into other languages by the WHATWG community. This
  is great, and highly encouraged!

  <p>In general, if you translate a WHATWG Standard, please communicate with the maintainers of the
  standard (e.g. via a GitHub issue) letting them know about your work. In general this will lead to
  adding a link to your translation to the top of the original standard, to allow interested readers
  to view it. You can see examples of this in many WHATWG standards, e.g., the
  <a href="https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/">Streams Standard</a>.

  <p>Such translations are not normative (i.e., implementations should be sure to consult the
  original). Due to the nature of living standards, which can change often, it’s possible for
  translations to become out of date compared to the original standard. If the translation shows
  signs of no longer being maintained, or has other quality problems, community members are
  encouraged to provide feedback to the maintainers of the standard, so that any links to the
  translation can be removed in order to avoid confusing readers.

  <p>Note that WHATWG standards are always licensed under liberal licenses that allow the creation
  of derivative works like translations.
